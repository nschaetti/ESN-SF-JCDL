Readers write — and wrong 1 



Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

Michael Glyer states in the Octo- 
ber, 1971 , issue of If, in so many 
words, that science fiction is not 
art. This is a point I have often 
discussed with friends, who have 
mostly taken the same attitude. 
My answer to this is that art in 
writing shows itself rarely anyway 
(let's assume for the moment that 
we know what we mean by art) 
and that if you single out any 
special category of writing, e.g. sf 
or detective stories or westerns, 
the proportion that we recognize 
as artistic will always be rather 
small — simply because the propor- 
tion of art in all writing is small. 
I believe that sf has produced quite 
a bit of art — such stuff as Miller s 
“Canticle for Leibowitz” and the 
best of Sturgeons work come 
immediately to my mind — and it's 
not realistic to expect all sf to mea- 
sure up to these standards. This 
argument applies to all artistic 
endeavours, incidentally— for the 
same reasons it is not fair to de- 
clare, say, modern music, jazz, 



pop-music, modern painting, etc 
etc, as non-art. 

While T m at it, some comments 
on If and Galaxy. I find your 
serials uniformly boring lately — 
the authors all seem to run out of 
steam shortly after ( mostly ) prom- 
ising beginnings. Examples: I Will 
Fear No Evil, the Dune series 
and that Laumer story about a 
year back, whose name I've for- 
gotten. I think Laumer should drop 
Retief—he's played out and will 
never again rise to such heights as 
in the beautiful “Retiefs War.” 
While I'm an enthusiastic Austra- 
lian ( with reservations in the field 
of politics ), I consider Chandler s 
stories also uniformly boring — a 
pity. Otherwise, I’m happy with 
your editing.

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

Science fiction people have al- 
ways prided themselves in their 
belief that their genre alone is con- 
cerned with future extrapolation 
and possibilities. Yet who has 
written the most significant and 
important book of many, many 
years concerning the future? Future 
Shock is by Alvin Toffler, a soci- 
ologist — and blessed be his insight. 
Why weren't all the probabilities 

( Please turn to page 175)

That is the prediction of the cele- 
brated writer Colin Wilson, who 
bases his revolutionary ideas on an 
intensive study of all aspects of 
spiritualism and its important 
figures. In his brilliant new book, 
The Occult: A History, he dis- 
cusses them all— the lives and 
mysterious powers of Nostra- 
damus, Dr. John Dee, Cagliostro 
Anton Mesmer, Aleister Crowley, 
Gurdjieff, Ouspensky, Rasputin, 
and Edgar Cayce, as well as the 
occult theories and experiences 
of Yeats, Wordsworth, Freud, Jung, 
T. S. Eliot, George Bernard Shaw, 
Bertrand Russell, Robert Graves, 
and Bishop Pike. Also covered are 
telepathy; prophecy; the / Ching; 
the Tarot pack; the Kaballah; 
astrology; mysticism; satanism; 
witchcraft; ghosts, vampires, and 
werewolves; and reincarnation. 

The Occult is a fascinating work 
—an exciting journey into the 
strangest and most powerful 
regions of man’s mind and soul.

SYNOPSIS OF PARTI 
(Galaxy, March, 1972) 

Plutonium- 186, an “impossible” 
isotope, is nevertheless discovered on 
Earth. It develops that alien intelli- 
gence in a parallel Universe is ex- 
changing the substance for our ordinary 
tungsten. Here the unstable P-186 
breaks down to tungsten while there 
the tungsten breaks down to P-186. 
This releases atomic particles that soon 
furnish limitless pollution-free energy, 
at no cost, to both Universes — con- 
tributing immensely to human welfare 
and presumably that of the aliens. But 
one Earth scientist warns that contin- 
ually “pumping” electrons out of our 
Universe into the “para- Universe” will 
alter both with ultimately disastrous 
consequences. He finds his career 
blasted by a scientific establishment 
committed to material posterity. 

(Part II of The Gods Themselves, 
is set entirely in the alternate of para- 
Universe devoid of humankind. Be- 
longing in The Magazine of Alterna- 
tives on several counts, it can be read 
and enjoyed for its own sake. For 
fullest appreciation of this wise and 
significant novel, of course, you may 
wish to take advantage of the offer on 
page 71 and read the entire work upon 
its first publication anywhere.) 



la 

D UA did not have much trou- 
ble leaving the others. She 
.always expected trouble, but 
somehow it never came. Never 
real trouble. 

But then, why should it? 



7 




Odeen objected in his lofty way. 
“Stay put,” he would say. “You 
know you annoy Tritt.’’ He never 
spoke of his own annoyance — 
Rationals did not become annoyed 
over trifles. Still, Odeen hovered 
over Tritt almost as persistently 
as Tritt hovered over the children. 

But Odeen always let Dua have 
her way if she were persistent 
enough. He would even intercede 
in her favor wijth Tritt. , Some- 
times he went so far as to admit 
he was proud of her ability, of her 
independence. He was not a bad 
Left-ling, she thought with absent 
affection. 

Tritt was harder to handle and 
had a sour way of looking at her 
when she was — well, when she was 
as she wished to be. But Right- 
lings were like that. He was a 
Right-ling to her, but a Parental to 
the children' and the latter took 
precedence always. Which was 
good because she could always 
count on one child or another 
taking him away when things be- 
came uncomfortable. 

Still, Dua did not mind Tritt 
very much. Except for melting, she 
tended to, ignore him. Odeen was 
something else. He had been excit- 
ing at first — his presence alone had 
made her outlines shimmer and 
fade. And the fact that he was a 
Rational made him somehow all 
the more exciting. She didn’t under- 
stand her reaction to what he was — 
it was part of her queerness. She 
had grown used to her queerness — 
almost. 

Dua sighed. 

As a child, when she still had 
thought of herself as an individual 



—a single being and not a part of 
a triad — she had been much more' 
aware of the strangeness. As little a 
thing as the surface at evening. 

She had loved the surface at even- 
ing. The other Emotionals had 
called it cold and gloomy and had 
uivered and coalesced when she 
escribed it for them. They were 
ready enough to emerge in the 
warmth of midday and stretch and 
feed— but they were exactly what 
made the midday dull. Dua did 
not like to be around the twitter* 
ing lot of them. 

She had to eat, of course, but 
she liked it much better in the eve- 
ning when there was very little 
food but everything was a dijrn* 
deep red and she was alone. Of 
course, she had described it as 
colder and more wistful than it was 
when she had talked to the others. 
She had liked to watch them arow 
hard-edged as they imagined the 
chill — or as hard-edged as young 
Emotionals could. And after a 
while they had begun to whisper 
about her and laugh at her— and 
leave her alone. — 

The small Sun was at the hori- 
zon now, with the secret ruddiness 
that she alone was there to see. She 
spread herself out laterally and 
thickened dorso-ventrally, absorb- 
ing the traces of thin warmth. She 
munched at it idly, savoring the 
slightly sour, substanceless taste 
of the long wavelengths. (She had 
never met another Emotional who 
would admit to liking it. But she 
could never explain that she as- 
sociated it with freedom — freedom 
from the others, a time she could 
spend alone.). 



ft 



IF 




Even now the loneliness, the chill 
and the deep, deep red, brought 
back those old days before the 
triad— and even more, quite 
sharply, the memory of her own 
Parental who would come lumber- 
ing after her, forever fearful that 
she would hurt herself. 

He had been carefully devoted 
to her, as Parentals always were 
to their Little-mids. His devotion 
had annoyed her and she had 
dreamed of the day when he would 
leave her — Parentals always did 
eventually. But how she had 
missed him when one day he finally 
left. 

v He had come to tell her just as 
carefully as he could, despite 
the difficulty Parentals had in 
putting, their feelings into words. 
She had run from him that day— 
not in malice and not because she 
suspected what he had to tell her 
— only out of joy. She had man- 
aged to find a special place at mid- 
day and had gorged herself in 
unexpected isolation and had been 
filled with a queer, itching sensa- 
tion that demanded motion and 
activity. She had slithered over the 
rocks and had let her edges overlap 
theirs. She had known it was a 
grossly improper action for anyone 
but a baby and yet it had been 
something at once exciting and 
soothing. 

And her Parental had caught her 
at last and had stood before her, 
silent for a long time, making his 
eyes small and dense as though to 
stop every bit of light reflected 
from her — to see as much as he 
could of her and for as long as 
possible. So vividly did that earlier 



time return that suddenly she 
could see it as if it were now . 

AT FIRST she just stared 
xV. back at her Parental with 
the confused thought that he had 
seen her rub through the rocks and 
was ashamed of her. But she caught 
no shame aupa and finally asked 
subduedly, “What is it. Daddy?” 

“Why, Dua, it’s the time. I’ve 
been expecting it. Surely yoir 
have.” 

“What time?” Now that the 
moment was here, Dua stubbornly 
would not let herself know. If she 
refused to know, there would be 
nothing to know. (She never quite 
got out ofthat habit. Odeen said all 
Emotionals were like (hat, speak- 
ing in the lofty voice he used some- 
times when he was particularly 
overcome with the importance of 
being a Rational.) 

Her Parental said, “I must pass 
on. I will not be with you any 
more.” Then he just stood and 
looked at her and she could say 
nothing. 

He said, “You will tell the 
others.” 

“Why?” Dua turned away 
rebelliously, her outlines vague 
and growing vaguer— she tried to 
dissipate. She wanted to dissipate 
altogether and of course she 
couldn’t. After a while the effort 
hurt and cramped and she hard- 
ened again. Her Parental didn’t 
even bother to scold her and tell 
her that it would be shameful if 
anyone saw her stretched out so. 

She said, “They won’t care—” 
and immediately felt sorrowful that 
her Parental would be hurt by the 



THE GODS THEMSELVES

words. He still called her brothers 
“Little-left” and “Little-right,” 
but Little-left was all involved with 
his studies and Little-right kept 
talking about forming a triad. Dua 
was the only one of the three who 
stiH felt . Well, she was the 
youngest. Emotionals always 
were apd with them everything was 
different. 

Her Parental merely said, “You 
will tell them anyway.” And he 
and she again stood looking at each 
other. 

She didn’t want to tell her 
brothers. They weren’t close any 
more. It had been different when 
they were all little. They could 
hardly tell themselves apart in 
those days — Left-brother from 
Right-brother from Mid-sister. 
They were all wispy and would 
tangle with each other and roll 
through each other and hide in the 
walls. 

No one ever minded their games 
when they were little— none of the 
grownups. But then the brothers 
grew thick and sober and drew 
away. And when she complained to 
her Parental he would only say 
gently, “You are too old to thin, 
Dua/’ 

She tried not to listen, but Left- 
brother kept drawing away and 
would say, “Don’t snuggle — I 
have no time for you.” And Right- 
brother began to stay quite hard 
all the time and became glum and 
silent. She did not understand it 
yet and Daddy had not been able 
to make it clear. He would say 
every once in a while as though 
giving her a lesson he had once 
learned, “Lefts are Rationals, Dua. 



Rights are Parentals. They grow up 
their own way.” 

She didn’t like their way. They 
were no longer children and she 
still was, so she flocked with the 
other Emotionals. They all had the 
same complaints about their 
brothers. They all talked of com- 
ing triads. They all spread in the 
Sun and fed. They all grew more 
and more the same and every day 
the same things were said. 

And she began to detest them and 
went off by herself whenever she 
could, so that they took to calling 
her “Left-Em.” (It had been a long 
time now since she had heard that 
call, but she never thought of the 
phrase without remembering per- 
fectly the thin ragged voices that 
had sent it after her with a kind of 
half-wit persistence because the 
owners of the voices knew it hurt.) 

But her Parental had retained his 
interest in her even when it jnust 
have seemed to him that everyone 
else laughed at her. He had tried in 
his clumsy way to shield her from 
the others. He had followed her to 
the surface sometimes — even 
though he hated it himself— in 
order to make sure she was safe. 

She had come upon him once 
when he was talking to a Hard One. 
It was hard for a Parental to talk 
to a Hard One— even though she 
was quite young, she knew that 
much. Hard Ones talked only to 
Rationals. 

She had been quite frightened 
and had wisped away, but not 
before she had heard her Parental 
say, “I take good care of her, 
Hard-Sir.” 

Could the Hard One have in- 



10 



IF 




quired about her? About her queer- 
ness, perhaps? But her Parental 
had not been apologetic. Even to 
the Hard One he had spoken of his 
concern for her. Dua had felt an 
obscure pride. 

But now he was leaving and sud- 
denly all the independence that 
Dua had been looking forward to 
lost its fine shape and hardened 
into the pointed crag of loneliness. 

She asked, “But why must you 
pass on?” 

“I must, little Mid-dear.” 

He must. She knew that. Every- 
one, sooner or later, must. The day 
would come when she would have 
to sigh and say, / must. 

“But what makes you know when 
you have to pass on? If you can 
choose your time why don’t you 
choose a different time and stay 
longer?” 

He said, “Your Left-father has 
decided. TTie triad must do as he 
says.” 

“Why must you do as he says?” 
She hardly ever saw her Left-father 
or her Mid-mother. They did not 
count any more. Only her Right- 
father, her Parental, her daddy, 
who stood there squat and flat- 
surfaced. He was not all smoothly 
curved like a Rational or shuddery 
uneven like an Emotional and she 
could always tell what he was going 
to say. Almost always. 

She was sure he would say, / 
cant Explain to a little Emotional. 

He said it. 

Dua said in a burst of woe, “I’ll 
miss you, I know you think I pay 
you no attention and that I don’t 
like you because you always tell 
me not to do things. But I would 



rather not like you for telling me 
not to do things than not have you 
around to tell me not to do things.” 

And Daddy just stood there. 
There was no way he could handle 
an outburst like that except to 
come closer and pinch out a hand. 
That action cost him a visible ef- 
fort, but he held his hand out 
trembling and its outlines were 
ever so slightly soft* 

Dua said, “Oh, Daddy—” and 
let her own hand flow about his 
so that it looked misfy and shim- 
mery through her substance, but 
she was careful not to touch it- for 
that would have-embarrassed him 
so. 

Then he withdrew his hand and 
left hers enclosing nothing. 

He said, “Remember the Hard 
Ones, Dua. They will help you. 
I — I will go now.” 

He went and she never saw him 
again. 

Now she sat remembering in the 
Sunset, rebelliously aware that 
pretty soon Tritt would grow pet- 
ulant over her absence and nag 
Odeen. 

And then Odeen might lecture 
her on her duties. 

She didn’t care. 

lb 

O DEEN was moderately aware 
that Dua was off on the sur- 
face. Without really thinking about 
it he could judge her direction and 
even something of her distance. If 
he had stopped to think of it he 
might have felt displeasure, for 
this inter-awareness sense had been 
steadily deadening for a long time 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



11 




now ahd, without really being 
certain why, he had a sense of 
gathering fulfillment about it. It 
was the way things were supposed 
to be — the sign of the continuing 
development of the body with age. 

Tritt v s inter-awareness sense did 
not decrease, but it shifted more 
and more toward the children. That 
was clearly the line of useful devel- 
opment. But the role of the Parental 
was a* simple one, in a manner of 
speaking, however important. The 
Rational was far more complex and 
Odeen took a bleak satisfaction in 
that thought. ' 

Of course, Dua was the real 
puzzle. She was so unlike all the 
other Emotionals. Her oddness 
perplexed aifd frustrated Tritt and 
reduced him to even more pro- 
nounced inarticulateness. Dua 
baffled" and frustrated Odeen at 
times, too, but he was also aware 
of her infinite capacity to induce 
satisfaction with life and it did not 
seem likely that one quality was 
independent of the other. The occa- 
sional exasperation she caused was 
a small price to pay for intense 
happiness. 

And maybe Dua’s strange way of 
life was part of what ought to. be, 
too. The Hard Ones seemed inter- 
ested in her and ordinarily they 
paid attention only to Rationals. 
He felt pride in that— so much the 
better for the triad that even the 
Emotional was worth attention. 

Odeen was pleased. 

Things were as they were sup- 
posed to be. That was bedrock and 
what he wanted most to feci — even 
to the end. Some day he would even 
know when it was time to pass on 



and he would want to. The Hard 
Ones assured him of that, as they 
assured all Rationals, but they also 
told him that it was his own inner 
consciousness that would mark the 
time unmistakably and without 
any advice from outside. 

“When you tell yourself,” Losten 
had told him in the clear, careful 
way in which a Hard One always 
talked to a Soft One, as though the 
Hard One were laboring to make 
himself understood, “that you 
know why you must pass on — then 
you will pass on, and your triad 
will pass on with you.” 

And Odeen had said, “1 cannot 
say I wish to pass on now, Hard- 
Sir. There is so much to learn.” 
“Of course. Left-dear. You feel 
this because you are not yet ready.” 
Odeen thought, How can / ever 
feel ready when I will never feel 
there isn't much to learn . 

But he did not say so. He was 
quite certain the time would come 
,and he would then understand. 

He looked down at himself, 
almost forgetting and thrusting 
out an eye to do so — always some 
childish impulses remained in the 
most adult of the most Rational. 
He did not have to use an eye, of 
course. He could sense quite well 
with his eye solidly in place, and he 
found himself satisfactorily solid — 
in nice, sharp outline, smooth, and 
curved into gracefully conjoined 
ovoids. 

His body lacked the strangely 
attractive shimmer of Dua’s and 
the comforting stockiness of Tritt’s. 
He loved them both, but he would 
not change his own body for 
either’s. Or, of course, his mind. 



12 



IF 




He would never say so, for he 
would not want to hurt their 
feelings, but he never ceased being 
thankful that he did^not have Tritt’s 
limited understanding or (even 
more) Dita’s erratic one. He sup- 
posed they did not mind — for they 
knew nothing else. 

H E GREW distantly aware of 
Dua again and deliberately 
dulled the sense. At the moment 
he felt no need for her. It was not 
that he wanted her less, merely 
that he had increasing drives else- 
where. It was part of the growing 
maturity of a Rational to find more 
and more satisfaction in the exer- 
cise of a mind that could be exerted 
to capacity only alone — and with 
the Hard Ones. 

He grew constantly more accus- 
tomed to the Hard Ones,.constantly 
more attached to them. He felt 
that this, too, was right and proper, 
for he was a Rational, and in a way 
the Hard Ones were super- Ration- 
al. (He had once said that to 
Losten, the friendliest of the Hard 
Ones aad, it seemed to Odeen in 
some vague way, the youngest. 
Losten had radiated amusement 
but had said nothing. He had not 
denied it, however.) 

Odeen’s earliest memories were 
filled with Hard Ones. His Parental 
more and more concentrated his 
attention on the last child, the 
baby-Emotional. That was only 
natural. (Tritt would do the same 
when the last child came, if it ever 
did. Odeen had picked up that last 
qualification from Tritt, who used 
it constantly as a reproach to Dua.) 
But with his Parental busy so 



,much of the time Odeen had begun 
his education early. He was losing 
his baby ways and he had learned 
a great deal even before he met 
Tritt. 

That meeting, though, was surely 
something he would never forget. 
It might as well have been yester- 
day as more than half a lifetime 
ago. He had seen Parentals of his 
own generation, of course — young 
ones who, long before they incu- 
bated the children that made true 
Parentals of them, showed few 
signs of the stolidity to come. As a 
child he had played with his own 
right-brother and was scarcely 
aware of any intellectual difference 
between them (though, looking 
back on those days, he recognized 
that the difference was there, even 
then.) 

He knew also vaguely the role of 
a Parental in a triad. Even as a 
child he had heard whispered tales 
of melting. 

When Tritt first appeared — when 
Odeen saw him first— everything 
changed. For, the first time in his 
life Odeen felt an inner warmth 
and began to think that there was 
something he wanted that was 
utterly divorced from thought. 
Even now he could remember the 
sense of embarrassment that had 
accompanied this discovery. 

Tritt was not embarrassed, of 
course. Parentals were never em- 
barrassed about the activities of 
the triad, and Emotionals were 
almost ' never embarrassed. Only 
Rationals had that problem. 

“Too much thinking,” a Hard 
One had said when Odeen had 
discussed the problem with him 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



13 




and that left Odeen dissatisfied. 
In what way would thinking be 
“too much?” 

Tritt was young when they first 
met. He was still so childish as to 
be uncertain in his blockishness so 
that his reaction to the meeting was 
-Embarrassingly clear. He grew 
almost translucent along his edges. 

Odeen said hesitantly, “I haven’t 
seen you before, have I, Right- 
fellow?” 

Tritt said, “1 have never been 
here. I have been brought here-” 

They both knew exactly \vhat had 
happened to them. The meeting 
had been arranged because some- 
one (some Parental, Odeen had 
thought at the time, but later he 
.-knew it was some Hard One) 
thought they would suit each other 
and the thought was correct. 

There was no intellectual rapport 
between the two. How could there 
be when Odeen wanted to learn 
with an intensity that superseded 
anything but the existence of the 
triad itself and Tritt lacked the 
very concept of learning? What 
Tritt had to know he already 
knew beyond either learning or 
unlearning. 

Odeen, out of the excitement of 
finding out about the world and its 
Sun — about the history and mech- 
anism of life, about all the abouts 
in the Universe— sometimes (in 
those early days together) found 
himself spilling his enthusiasm 
over to Tritt. 

Tritt listened placidly, clearly 
understanding nothing, but content 
to be listening while Odeen, trans- 
mitting nothing, was as dearly 
content to be lecturing. 



I T WAS Tritt who made the 
first move, driven by his special . 
needs. Odeen was chattering about 
what he had learned that day after 
the brief midday meal. (Their 
thicker substance absorbed food 
so rapidly that they were satisfied 
with a simple walk in the Sun, 
while Emotionals basked for hours 
at a time, curling and thinning as 
though deliberately to lengthen 
the task.) 

Odeen, who always ignored the 
Emotionals, was quite happy to 
be talking. Tritt, who stared word- 
lessly at them day after day, was 
now visibly restless. 

- Abruptly he came close to Odeen, 
formed an appendage so hastily as 
to clash most disagreeably with 
Odeen’s form-sense. He placed the 
outcropping upon a portion of 
Odeen’s upper ovoid where a slight 
shimmer was allowing for a wel- 
come draft of warm air as dessert. 
Tritt’s appendage thinned with a 
visible effort and sank into the 
superficies of Odeen’s skin before 
the latter darted away, horribly 
embarrassed. 

He had done such things as a 
baby, of course, but never since 
his adolescence. “Don’t do that, 
Tritt,” he said sharply. 

Tritt’s appendage remained out, 
groping a little. “I want to.” 

Odeen held himself as compactly 
as he could, striving to harden the 
surface to bar entry. “I don’t want 
to.” 

“Why not?” asked Tritt urgently. 
“There’s nothing wrong.” 

Odeen said the first thing that 
came into his mind. “It hurt.” (It 
didn’t really. Not physically. But 



14 



IF 




the Hard Ones always avoided the 
touch of the Soft Ones. A careless 
interpenetration did hurt Hard 
Ones, but they were constructed 
differently from Soft Ones— com- 
pletely differently.) 

Tritt was not fooled. His instinct 
could not possibly mislead him in 
this respect. He said, “It didn’t 
hurt.” 

“Well, it isn’t right this way. We 
need an Emotional.’’ 

And Tritt could only say stub- 
bornly, “I want to, anyway.’’ 

It was bound to continue 
happening and Odeen was bound 
to give in. It always came about 
so— even with the most self-con- 
scious Rational. As the old saying 
had it — Everyone either admitted 
doing it or lied about it. 

Tritt was at him at each meeting 
after that— if not with an appen- 
dage, then rim to rim. And finally 
Odeen, seduced by the pleasure of 
it, began to help and tried to thin. 
He was better at that tlian Tritt. 
Poor Tritt, infinitely more eager, 
huffed and strained and could 
achieve only the barest shimmer 
here and there, patchily and 
raggedly. 

Odeen, however, could turn 
translucent all over his surface and 
fought down his embarrassment in 
order to let himself flow against 
Tritt. There was skin-deep pene- 
tration and Odeen could feel the 
pulsing of Trrtt’s hard surface 
under the skin. There was enjoy- 
ment, riddled with guilt. 

Tritt, as often as not, was tired 
and vaguely angry when it was 
over. 

Odeen said, “Now, Tritt, I’ve 



told you we need an Emotional to 
do this properly. You can’t be 
angry at something that jus^ is.’’ 

And Tritt said, “Let’s get an 
Emotional.” 

Let’s get an Emotional! Tritt’s 
simple drives never led him to any- 
thing but direct action. Odeen was 
not sure he could explain the com- 
plexities of life to the other. 

“It’s not that easy, Right-ling—” 
he began gently. 

Tritt said abruptly. “The Hard 
Ones can get us one. You’re 
friendly with them. Ask them.” 

Odeen was horrified. “I can’t 
ask. The time,” he continued, 
unconsciously falling into his lec- 
turing voice, “has not yet come — or 
I would certainly know it. Until — ” 

Tritt was not listening. He said, 
“I’ll ask.” 

“No,” said Odeen, horrified. 
“You stay out of it. I tell you it’s 
not time. I have an education to 
worry about. It’s very easy to be a 
Parental and not to have to know 
anything but—” 

He was sorry the instant he had 
spoken, and it was a lie anyway. 
He just didn’t want to do anything 
at all that might offend the Hard 
Ones and impede his useful rela- 
tionship with them. Tritt, however, 
showed no signs of minding, and 
Odeen began to think that the other 
saw no point or merit in knowing 
anything he did not already know 
and would not consider the state- 
ment of the fact an insult. 

The problenrf of the Emotional 
kept coming up, though. Occasion- 
ally they tried interpenetration. In 
fact, the impulse grew stronger 
with time. It was never truly satis- 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



15 




fying though it had its pleasure and 
each time Tritt would demand an 
Emotional. Each time Odeen threw 
himself deeper into his studies, 
almost as a defense against the 
problem. 

Yet at times he was tempted to 
speak to Losten ahout the problem. 

I OSTEN was the Hard One 
4 Odeen knew best, the one who 
took the greatest personal interest 
in him. There was a deadly same- 
ness about the Hard Ones, because 
they did not change. They never 
changed — their form w#s fixed. 
Where their eyes were they always 
were — and always in the same 
place for all of 'them. Their skin 
was not exactly hard* but it was 
always opaque. It never shimmered, 
was never vague, never penetrable 
by another skin of its own type. 

Hard Ones were not larger in 
size, particularly, than the Soft 
Ones, but they were heavier. Their 
substance was much denser and 
they had to be careful about the 
yielding tissues of the Soft Ones. 

Once when he had been little — 
really little — and his body had 
flowed almost as freely as his 
sister’s, Odeen had been 1 ap- 
proached by a Hard One. He had 
never known which one it was, but 
he learned in later life that all of 
them were curious about baby- 
Rationals. Odeen had reached up 
for the Hard One out of nothing 
but curfosity. The Hard One had 
sprung backward, and later 
Odeen’s Parental had scolded him 
for offering to touch a Hard One. 

The scolding had been harsh 
enough for Odeen never to forget. 



When he was older he learned that 
the close-packed atoms of the 
Hard One’s tissues felt pain on the 
forcible penetration of others. 
Odeen wondered if the Soft One 
felt pain, too. Another young Ra- 
tional once told him that he had 
stumbled against a Hard One and 
the Hard One had doubled up but 
that he himself had felt nothing — 
but Odeen Wasn’t sure this was not 
just a melodramatic boast. 

There were other things he was 
not supposed to do. He liked 
rubbing against the walls Qf the 
cavern. There was a pleasant, warm 
feeling when he allowed himself to 
penetrate rock. Babies always did 
it, but it became harder to do as he 
grew older. Still, he could do it 
skin-deep and he liked the feeling, 
but his Parental found him doing 
it and scolded him. Odeen objected 
that his sister did it all the time — 
he had seen her. 

“That’s different,’’ said the 
Parental. “She’s an Emotional.’’ 

At another time when Odeen was 
absorbing a recording — he was 
older then — he had idly formed a 
couple of projections and made 
the tips so thin that he could pass 
one through the other. He began to 
do it regularly when he listened. 
There was a pleasant tickling sen- 
sation that made it easier to listen 
and made him nicely sleepy 
afterward. 

His Parental caught him at that, 
too, and what he had said still made 
Odeen uncomfortable. 

No one really told him about 
melting in those days. They fed 
him knowledge and educated him 
about everything except about what 



16 



IF 




the triad was. Tritt had never been 
told either, but he was a Parental 
and knew without being told. Of 
course, when Dua came at last all 
was clear, even though she seemed 
to know less than Odeen. 

But she did not come to them 
because of anything Odeen did. It 
was Tritt who broached the matter 
—Tritt, who ordinarily feared the 
Hard Ones and avoided them 
mutely — Tritt, who lacked Odeen’s 
self-assurance in all but this re- 
spect — Tritt, who on this one sub- 
ject was driven — Tritt — Tritt — 
Tritt — 

Odeen sighed. Tritt was invading 
his thoughts because Tritt was 
coming. He could feel him, harsh, 
demanding, always demanding. 
Odeen had so little time to himself 
these days, just when he felt that he 
needed to think more than ever. 

“Yes, Tritt,” he said. 

lc 

T RITT was conscious of his 
blockiness. He did not think it 
ugly. He did not think about it at 
all. If he had given it a thought, he 
would have considered it beautiful. 
His body was designed for a pur- 
pose and designed well. 

He asked, “Odeen, where is 
Dua?” 

“Outside somewhere,” mumbled 
Odeen, almost as though he didn’t 
care. It annoyed Tritt to have the 
triad made so little of. Dua was so 
difficult and Odeen didn’t care. 
“Why do you let her go?” 

“How can I stop her, Tritt? And 
what harm if she goes outside?” 
“You know the harm. We have 



two babies. We need a third. It is 
so hard to make a little-mid these 
days. Dua must be properly fed for 
it to be made. Now she is wander- 
ing about at Sunset again. How can 
she feed fully at Sunset?” 

“She’s just not a great feeder.” 
“And we just don’t have a little- 
mid. Odeen.” Tritt’s voice was 
caressing. “How can I love you 
properly without Dua?” 

“Now, then,” mumbled Odeen 
and Tritt felt himself once more 
puzzled by the other’s clear embar- 
rassment at the simplest statement 
of fact. 

Tritt said, “Remember, I was the 
one who first got Dua.” Did Odeen 
remember that? Did Odeen ever 
think of the triad and what • it 
meant? Sometimes^ Tritt felt so 
frustrated he could — he could — 
Actually, he did not know what he 
could do, but he knew he felt frus- 
trated. As in those old days when 
he wanted an Emotional and Odeen 
would do nothing. 

Tritt knew he didn’t have the 
trick of talking- in big, elaborate 
sentences. But if Parentals didn’t 
talk, they thought. They thought 
about important things. Odeen 
always talked about atoms and 
energy. Who cared about atoms 
and energy? Tritt thought about 
the triad and the babies. 

Odeen had once told him that the 
numbers of Soft Ones were grad- 
ually growing fewer. Didn’t he 
care? Didn’t the Hard Ones care? 
Did anyone care but the Parentals? 

Only two forms of life on all the 
world, the Soft Ones and the Hard 
Ones. And food shining down on 
them. 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



17 




Odeen had once told him the Sun 
was cooling off. There was less 
food, he said, so there were fewer 
people. Tritt didn’t believe it. The 
Sun felt no cooler than it had when 
he was a baby. People were just 
not worrying about the triads any 
more. Too many absorbed Ration- 
als— too many silly Emotionals. 

What the Soft Ones must do was 
concentrate on the important things 
of life. Tritt did. He tended to the 
business of the triad. The baby-left 
came, then the baby-right. They 
were growing and flourishing. They 
had to have a baby-mid* though. 
That was the hardest to get started 
and without a baby-mid there 
would be no new triad. 

What made Dua as she was? She 
had always been difficult, but she 
was growing worse. 

Tritt felt an obscure anger 
against Odeen. Odeen always 
talked with all those hard words. 
And Dua listened. Odeen would 
talk to Dua endlessly till they were 
almost two Rationals. That was 
bad for the triad. 

Odeen should know better. 

It was always Tritt who had to 
care. It was always Tritt who had 
to do what had to be done. Odeen 
was the friend of the Hard Ones 
and yet he said nothing. They had 
needed an Emotional and Odeen 
had done nothing. He talked to 
the Hard Ones about energy and 
not of the needs of the triad. 

It had been Tritt, who had turned 
the scale. Tritt remembered that 
proudly. He had seen Odeen talk- 
ing to a Hard One, and he had 
approached. Without a shake in his 
voice, he had interrupted and said, 



“We need an Emotional.’’ 

The Hard One had turned to look 
at him. Tritt had never been so 
close to a^Hard One. He was all of 
a piece. Every part of him had to 
turn when one part did. He had 
some projections that could move 
by themselves, but they never 
changed in shape. They never 
flowed and they were irregular and 
unlovely. Hard Ones did not like 
to be touched. 

The Hard One asked, “Is this 
so, Odeen?’’ He did not speak to 
Tritt. 

Odeen flattened. He flattened 
close to the ground, became more 
flattened than Tritt had ever seen 
him. 

Odeen said, “My Right-ling is 
overzealous. My Right-ling is — 
is — ’’ He stuttered and puffed and 
could not speak. 

Tritt could speak. He said, “We 
cannot melt without one.’’ 

Tritt knew that Odeen was em- 
barrassed into speechlessness but 
he didn’t care. It was time. 

“Well, Left-dear,’’ said the Hard 
One to Odeen, “do you feel the 
same way about it?’’ Hard Ones 
spoke as the Soft Ones did, but 
more harshly and with fewer over- 
tones. The Hard Ones were difficult 
to listen to. Tritt found them so 
anyway, though Odeen seemed 
used to them. 

“Yes,’’ said Odeen finally. 

The Hard One turned at last to 
Tritt. “Remind me, Young-right 
How long have you and Odeen been 
together?’’ 

“Long enough,’’ said Tritt, “to 
deserve an Emotional.*’ He kept 
his shape firmly at angles. He did 



18 



IF 




not allow himself to be frightened. 
The matter was too important. He 
added: “And my name is Tritt.” 
The Hard One seemed amused. 
“Yes, the choice was good. You 
and Odeen go well "together, but it 
makes the choice of an Emotional 
difficult. We have almost made up 
our minds. Or at least I have long 
since made up my mind, but the 
others must be convinced. Be pa- 
tient, Tritt.” 

“I am tired of patience.” 

“I know, but be patient anyway.” 
He was amused again.. 

W HEN the Hard One was 
quite gone Odeen uplifted 
himself and thinned out angrily. He 
asked, “How could you do that, 
Tritt? Do you know who he is?” 
“A Hard One.” 

“He is Losten. My special 
teacher. I don’t want him angry 
with me.” 

“Why should he be angry? I was 
polite.” 

“Well, never mind.” Odeen was 
settling into normal shape. That 
meant he was not angry any more. 
(Tritt was relieved, though he tried 
not to show it.) “It’s very embar- 
rassing for my dumb-right to come 
up and speak out to my Hard One.” 
“Why didn’t you speak out, 
then?” 

“There’s such a thing as the 
right time.” 

“But never’s the right time for 
you.” 

But then they rubbed surfaces 
and stopped arguing and Dua came 
not long after that. 

Losten brought her. Tritt did 
not realize— he did not look at the 



Hard One. Only at Dua. But 
Odeen told him afterward that 
Losten had brought her. 

“You see?” said Tritt. “I talked 
to him. That is why he brought 
her.” 

“No,” said Odeen. “It was time. 
He would have brought her even if 
neither of us had talked to him.” 

Tritt didn’t believe him. He was 
quite sure that it was entirely 
because of his actions that Dua was 
with them. 

Surely there had never been 
anyone like Dua in the world. 
Tritt had seen many Emotionals. 
They were all attractive. He would 
have accepted any of them for 
proper melting. Once he saw Dua 
he realized that none of the others 
would have suited. Only Dua. Only 
Dua. 

And Dua knew exactly what to 
do. Exactly. No one had ever shown 
her how, she told them afterward. 
No one had ever talked to her 
about it. Even other Emotionals 
had not, for she had avoided them. 

Yet when all three were together; 
each knew what to do. 

Dua thinned. She thinned more 
than Tritt had ever seen anyone 
thin. She thinned more than Tritt 
would ever have thought possible. 
She became a kind of colored 
smoke that filled the room and 
dazzled him. He moved without 
knowing he was moving. He 
immersed himself in the air that 
was Dua. 

There was no sensation of pene- 
tration, none at all. Tritt felt no 
resistance, no friction. There was 
just a floating inward and a rapid 
palpitation. He felt himself 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



19 




beginning to thin in sympathy and 
without the tremendous effort that 
had always accompanied his 
thinning. With Dua filling him he 
could thin without effort into a 
thick smoke of his own. Thinning 
became like flowing — he became 
an enormous smooth flow. 

Dimly he could see Odeen 
approaching from the other side, 
from Dua’s left. And he, too, was 
thinning. 

Then, like all the shocks of con- 
tact in all the world, he reached 
Odeen. But it was not a shock at 
all. Tritt felt without feeling, knew 
without knowing. He slid into 
Odeen and Odeeh slid into him. He 
could not tell whether he was 
surrounding Odeen or being 
surrounded by him or both or 
neither. 

He knew only — pleasure. 

The senses dimmed with the 
intensity^of that pleasure, and at the 
point where he thought he could 
stand no more the senses failed 
altogether. 

E VENTUALLY they separated 
and stared at each other. They 
had melted for days. Melting al- 
ways took time. The better it was 
the longer it took. When the melt- 
ing was over, all that time seemed 
as though it had been an instant and 
they did not remember it. In later 
life it rarely took longer than that 
first time. ' 

Odeen said, “That was 
wonderful/’ 

Tritt only gazed at Dua, who 
had made it possible. 

She was coalescing, swirling, 
moving tremulously. She seemed 



most affected of the three. 

“We’ll do it again,’’ she said, 
hurriedly. “But later, later. Let me 
go now.’’ 

She ran away. They did not stop 
her. They were too overcome to 
stop her. But that was always the 
way afterward. She was always 
gone after melting. No matter how 
successful it was, she would go. 
Something in her needed to be 
alone. 

It bothered Tritt. In point after 
point she was different from other 
Emotionals. She should not be. 

Odeen felt otherwise. He would 
say on many occasions, “Why 
don’t you leave her alone, Tritt? 
She’s not like the others and that 
means she’s better than the others. 
Melting wouldn’t be as good if she 
were like the others. Do you want 
the benefits without paying the 
price?’’ 

Tritt did not understand that 
clearly. He knew only that she 
ought to do what ought to be done. 

He said, “I want her to do what 
is right.” 

“I know, Tritt, I know. But leave 
her alone anyway.” 

Odeen himself often scolded Dua 
for her queer ways but he was al- 
ways unwilling to let Tritt do so. 

“You lack tact, Tritt,” he would 
say. 

Tritt didn’t know what tact was 
exactly. 

And now — It had been so long 
since the first melting and still the 
baby- Emotional was not bom. 
How much longer? It was already 
much too long. And Dua, if any- 
thing, stayed by herself more, and 
more as time went on. 



IF 



20 




Tritt said, “She doesn’t eat 
enough.’’ 

“When it’s time—’’ began Odeen. 

“You always talk about it’s being 
time or it’s not being time. You 
never found it time to get Dua in 
the first place. Now you never find 
it time to have a baby-Emotional. 
Dua should—’’ 

But Odeen turned away. He said, 
“She’s out there, Tritt. If you want 
to go out and get her, as though 
you were her Parental instead of 
her Right-ling, do so. But I say, 
leave her alone.’’ 

Tritt backed away. He had a 
great deal to say, but he didn’t 
know how to say it. 

2a 

D UA was aware of the left-right 
agitation concerning her in a 
dim and faraway manner and her 
rebelliousness grew. 

If one or the other— or both — 
came to get her, the scene would 
end in a melting and she raged 
against the thought. Melting was 
all Tritt knew and, except for the 
children, all Tritt wanted — except 
for the third and last child. Every- 
thing was involved with the children 
and the still missing child. And 
when Tritt wanted a melting he 
got it. 

Tritt dominated the triad when 
he grew stubborn. He would hold 
on to some simple idea and never 
let go, and in the end Odeen and 
Dua would have to give in. Yet now 
she wouldn’t give in — she wouldn’t! 

She did not feel disloyal at the 
thought. She never expected to 
feel for either Odeen or Tritt the 

THE GODS THEMSELVES 



sheer intensity of longing they felt 
for each other. She could melt 
alone^they could melt only 
through her mediation— so why 
didn’t that make her the more 
regarded? She felt intense pleasure 
at the three-way melting, of 
course— she would be stupid to 
.deny it. The pleasure was akin to 
what she felt when she passed 
through a rock wall, as she some- 
times secretly did. To Tritt and 
Odeen the pleasure was like nothing 
else they had ever experienced or 
could ever experience. 

- No, wait. Odeen had the 
pleasure of learning, of what he 
called intellectual development. 
Dua felt some of that at times, 
enough to know what it might 
mean — and though it was different 
from melting it might serve as a 
substitute at least to the point 
where Odeen could do without— 
sometimes. 

But not so Tritt. For him there 
was only melting and the children. 
Only. And when his small mind 
bent entirely upon that Odeen 
would give in and then Dua would 
have to. 

Once she had rebelled. “But what 
happens when we melt? It’s hours, 
days sometimes, before we come 
out of it. What happens in all that 
time?” 

Tritt had looked outraged at 
that. “It’s always that way. It’s got 
to be.” 

“I don’t like anything that’s got 
to be. I want to know why.” 

Odeen had looked embarrassed. 
He spent half his life being 
embarrassed. He said, “Now, Dua, 
it does have to be. On account of — 

21 




children.” He seemed to pulse as 
he spoke the word. 

“Well, don’t pulse,” said Dua 
sharply. “We’re grown now and 
we’ve melted I don’t know how 
many times and we all know it’s 
so we can have children. You 
might as well say so. Why does it 
take so long? That’s all.” 

“Because it’s a complicated 
process,” said Odeen, still 
pulsing. “Because it takes energy. 
Dua, it takes a long time to get a 
child started and even when we 
take a long time a child doesn’t 
always get started. And it’s getting 
worse. Not just with us,” he added 
hastily. 

“Worse?” Tritt asked anxiously, 
but Odeen would say no more. 

They had a child eventually, a 
baby-Rational, a Left-ling, that 
flitted and thinned so that all three 
were in raptures and even Odeen 
would hold it and let it change 
shape in his hands for as long as 
Tritt would allow him. For it was 
Tritt, of course, who had actually 
incubated it through the long pre- 
forming. Tritt who had separated 
from it when it assumed indepen- 
dent existence and Tritt who cared 
for it at all times. 

After that Tritt was often not 
with them and Dua was oddly 
pleased. Tritt’s obsession annoyed 
her, but Odeen’ s — oddly — pleased 
her. She became increasingly 
aware of his — importance. There 
was something to being a Rational 
that made it possible to answer 
questions — and somehow Dua had 
questions for him constantly. He 
was readier to answer when Tritt 
was not present. 



“Why does it take so long, 
Odeen? I don’t like to melt and 
then not know what’s happening 
for days at a time.” 

“We’re perfectly safe, Dua,” 
said Odeen earnestly. “Come, 
nothing has ever happened to us, 
has it? You’ve never heard of 
anything ever happening to any 
other triad, have you? Besides, 
you shouldn’t ask questions.” 
“Because I’m an Emotional? 
Because other Emotionals don’t 
ask questions? I can’t stand other 
Emotionals — if you want to know 
—and I do want to ask questions.” 
She was perfectly aware that 
Odeen was looking at her as though 
he had never seen anyone as 
attractive and that if Tritt had been 
present, melting would have taken 
place at once. She even let herself 
thin out— not much, but percept- 
ibly— in deliberate coquettishness. 

Odeen said, “But you might not 
understand the implications, Dua. 
It takes a great deal of energy to 
initiate a new spark of life.” 
“You’ve often mentioned energy. 
What is it? Exactly?” 

“Why, what we eat.” 

“Well, then, why don’t you say 
x food?” 

“Because food and energy aren’t 
quite the same thing. Our food 
comes from the Sun and that’s a 
kind of energy, but there are other 
kinds of energy that are not food. 
When we eat we’ve got to spread 
out and absorb the light. It’s 
hardest for Emotionals because 
they’re much more transparent — 
that is, the light tends to pass 
through instead of being 
absorbed — ” 



22 



IF 




How wonderful to have it 
explained, Dua thought. What she 
was told she really knew— but she 
didn’t know the proper words, the 
long science-words that Odeen 
knew. And they made sharper and 
more meaningful everything that 
happened. 

O ccasionally now— in 

adult life when she no longer 
feared that childish teasing, when 
she shared in the prestige of being 
part of the Odeen-triad— she tried 
to swarm with other Emotionals 
and to withstand the chatter and the 
crowding. After all, she did 
occasionally feel like having a more 
substantial meal than she usually 
got and it did make for better 
melting. There was a joy— some- 
times she caught the pleasure the 
others got out of it — in slithering 
and maneuvering for exposure to 
Sunlight, in the luxurious contrac- 
tion and condensation to absorb the 
warmth through greater thickness 
with greater efficiency. 

Yet for Dua a little of that went 
quite a way and the others never 
seemed to have enough. There was 
a kind of gluttonous wiggle about 
them that Dua could not duplicate 
and that, at length, she could not 
endure. 

That was why Rationals and 
Parentals were so rarely on the 
surface. Their thickness made it 
possible for them to eat quickly and 
leave. Emotionals writhed in the 
Sun for hours, for though they ate 
more slowly they actually needed 
more energy than the others — at 
least for melting. 

The Emotional supplied the 



energy, Odeen had explained 
(pulsing so that his signals were 
barely comprehensible), the Ra- 
tional the seed, the Parental the 
incubator. 

Once Dua understood, a certain 
amusement began to blend with her 
disapproval when she watched the 
other Emotionals virtually slurp up 
the ruddy Sunlight. Since they 
never asked questions she was sure 
they didn’t know why they did so 
and couldn’t understand that there 
was an obscene side to their 
quivering condensations and to the 
way they went tittering down below 
eventually— on their way to a good 
melt, of course, with lots of energy 
to spare. 

She could also stand Tritt’s 
annoyance when she would come 
down without that swirling opacity 
that meant a good gorging. Yet 
why should Tritt and Odeen com- 
plain? The thinness she retained 
meant a defter melting. Not as 
sloppy and glutinous as the other 
triads managed, perhaps, but it 
was ethereality that counted, she 
felt sure. And the little-left and 
little-right came eventually didn’t 
they? 

Of course, it was the baby- 
Emotional, the little-mid, that 
was the crux. That took more 
energy than the other two, and Dua 
never had enough. 

Even Odeen was beginning to 
mention it. “You’re not getting 
enough Sunlight, Dua.’’ 

“Yes, I am,’’ said Dua hastily. 

“Genia’s triad,” said Odeen, 
“has just initiated an Emotional.” 

Dua did not like Genia. Genia 
was empty-headed even by 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



23 




Emotional standards. Dua said 
loftily, “ I suppose she's boasting 
about it. She has no delicacy. I 
suppose she's saying, ‘I shouldn't 
mention it, my dear, but you’ll 
never guesrwhat my Left-ling and 
Right-ling have gone and went and 
done — Dua imitated Genia’s 
tremulous signaling with deadly 
accuracy and Odeen was amused. 

But then he said, “Genia may be 
a dunder but she has initiated an 
Emotional, and Tritt is upset about 
it. We’ve been at it for much 
longer than the others have—” 

Dua turned away. “I get all the 
Sun I can stand. 1 feed till I’m too 
full to move. I don’t know what 
you want of me.” 

Odeen said, “Don’t be angry. I 
promised Tritt I would talk to you. 
He thinks you listen to me — ” 

“Oh, Tritt just thinks it’s odd 
that you explain science to me. He 
doesn’t understand. Do you want 
a Mid-ling like the others?” 

“No,” said Odeen, seriously. 
“You’re not like the others and 
I’m glad of it. And if you’re inter- 
ested in Rational talk let me 
explain something. The Sun doesn’t 
supply the food it used to in ancient 
times. The light-energy is less and 
requires longer exposures. The 
.birth rate has been dropping for 
ages and the world’s population is 
only a fraction of what it once 
was.” 

“I can’t help it,” said Dua 
rebelliously. 

“The Hard Ones may be able to. 
Their numbers have been decreas- 
ing, too — ” 

“Do they pass on?” Dua was 
suddenly interested. She had 



always thought the Hard Ones 
were immortal— that they weren’t 
born and didn’t die. Who had ever 
seen a baby Hard One, for 
instance? They didn’t have babies. 
They didn’t melt. They didn’t eat. 

Ojdeen said thoughfully, “I 
imagine they pass on. They never 
talk about themselves to me. I’m 
not even sure how they eat, but of 
course they must. And they have 
to be born. There’s a new one, for 
instance — I haven’t seen him yet — 
But never mind that. The point is 
that they’ve been developing an 
artificial food — ” 

“I know,” said Dua. “I’ve tasted 
it.” 

“You have? I didn’t know that.” 

“A bunch of the Emotionals 
talked about it. They said a Hard 
One was asking for volunteers to 
taste it and the sillies were all 
afraid. They said it would probably 
turn them permanently hard and 
they would never be able to melt 
again.” 

“That’s foolish,” said Odeen 
vehemently. 

“I know. So I volunteered. That 
shut them up. They are so difficult 
to endure, Odeen.” 

“How was it?” 

“Horrible,” said Dua firmly. 
“Harsh and bitter. Of course I 
didn’t tell the other Emotionals 
that.” 

Odeen said, “I tasted it. It 
wasn’t that bad.” 

“Rationals and Parentals don’t 
care what food tastes like.” 

But Odeen said, “It’s still only 
experimental. They’re working 
hard on improvements, the Hard 
Ones are. Especially Estwald — 



24 



IF 




that’s the one I mentioned before, 
the new one I haven’t seen — he’s 
working on it. Losten speaks of 
him now and then as though he 
were something special— a great 
scientist.” 

“How is it you’ve never seen 
him?” 

“I’m just a Soft One. You don’t 
suppose they show me and tell me 
everything, do you? Some day I’ll 
see him,. I suppose. He’s developed 
a new source of energy that may 
yet save us all—” 

“I don’t want artificial food.” 
said Dua, and left Odeen abruptly. 

That conversation had taken 
place not so long ago and Odeen 
had not mentioned the new food 
again. But she knew he would and 
she brooded about it up here in the 
Sunset. 

She had seen the artificial food 
that one time — a glowing sphere of 
light like a tiny Sun in a special 
cavern set up by the Hard Ones. 
She could taste its bitterness yet. 

Would they improve it? Would 
they make it taste better? Even 
delicious? And would she have to 
eat it then and fill herself with it 
till the full sensation gave her an 
uncontrollable desire to melt? 

She feared that self-generating 
desire. It was different when the 
desire came through the hectic 
combined stimulation of Left-ling 
and Right-ling. It was the self- 
generation that meant she would be 
ripe to bring about the initiation of 
a little-mid. And — and she didn’t 
want to start one! 

A long time passed before she 
would admit the truth to herself. 
She did not want to initiate an 



Emotional. It was after all three 
children were born that the time 
would inevitably come to pass on, 
something she did not want to do. 
She remembered the day her 
Parental had left her forever and 
it was never going to be like that 
for her. Of that she was fiercely 
determined. 

The other Emotionals did not 
care because they were too empty 
to think about it, but she was 
different. She was queer Dua, the 
Left-Em. That was what they had 
called her and she would be 
different. As long as she didn’t 
have that third child she would not 
pass on— she would continue to 
live. 

So she was not going to have 
that third child. Never. Never! 

But how was she going to stave 
it off? And how would she keep 
Odeen from finding out? What if 
Odeen found out? 

2b 

O DEEN waited for Tritt to do 
something. He was reason- 
ably sure that Tritt would not 
actually go up to the surface after 
Dua. It would mean leaving the 
children and that was always hard 
for Tritt to *do. Tritt waited 
without speaking for a while and 
when he left it was in the direction 
of the children’s alcove. 

Odeen was rather glad to see 
Tritt go. Not quite, of course, for 
Tritt had been angry and with- 
drawn so that interpersonal contact 
had weakened and the barrier of 
displeasure had arisen. Odeen 
could not help but be melancholy 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



25 




at that. It was like the slowing of 
the life-pulse. 

He sometimes wondered if Tritt 
felt it, too. No, the thought was 
unfair. Tritt had the special 
relationship with the children. 

As for Dua— who could tell what 
Dua felt? Who could tell what any 
Emotional felt? They were so 
different they made left and right 
seem alike in everything but mind. 
But even allowing for the erratic 
way of Emotionals, who could tell 
what Dua — especially Dua— felt? 

Dua was the problem. The delay 
in initialing the third child was 
indeed becoming too long, and Dua 
was growing less amenable to 
persuasion, not more. A restless- 
ness was growing in Odeen himself, 
one he could not quite identify, 
something he would have to discuss 
with Losten. 

He made his way down to the 
Hard Caverns, hastening his 
movements into a continuous flow 
that was not nearly as undignified 
as the oddly exciting mixture of 
wavering and rushing that marked 
the Emotional curve-along or as 
amusing as the stolid weight-shift 
of the Parental— 

(He had the keen thought-image 
of Tritt clumping in pursuit of the 
baby-Rational who, of course, was 
almost as slippery at his age as 
an Emotional and of Dua having to 
block the baby and bring him back 
and of Tritt cluckingly undecided 
whether to shake the small life- 
object or enfold him with his 
substance. From the start, Tritt 
could thin himself more effectively 
for the babies than for Odeen and 
when Odeen railed at him about 



that Tritt answered gravely, for he 
had no humor about such things, 
“Ah, but the children need it 
more.”) 

Odeen was selfishly pleased with 
his own flow and thought it grace- 
ful and impressive. He had men- 
tioned that once to Losten, to 
whom as his Hard-teaclier, he 
confessed everything. Losten had 
said, “But don’t you think 
Emotionals or Parentals feel the 
same about their own flow- 
patterns? If each of you thinks 
differently and acts differently, 
ought you not to be pleased 
differently? A triad doesn’t pre- 
clude individuality, you know.” 

Odeen was not sure he under- 
stood about individuality. Did that 
mean being alone? A Hard One was 
alone, of course. There were no 
triads among them. How did they 
stand it? 

/ Odeen had been quite young 
when the matter had come up and 
his relationship with the Hard 
Ones had only been beginning. The 
thought had suddenly struck him 
that he wasn’t sure there were no 
triads among them. The fact that 
none existed was common legend 
among the Soft Ones — but how 
correct was the legend? Odeen had 
thought about that and decided one 
must ask and not accept matters on 
faith. 

Odeen had asked, “Are you a 
Left or a Right, sir?” (In later times, 
Odeen pulsed at the memory of 
that question. How incredibly 
naive of him to have asked it. It 
was very little comfort that every 
Rational asked the question of a 
Hard One in some fashion sooner 



26 



IF 




or later — usually sooner.) 

Losten had answered quite 
calmly, “Neither, Little-left. There 
are no Lefts or Rights among 
the Hard Ones.” 

“Or Mid-1— Emotionals?” 

“Or Mid-lings?” And the Hard 
One changed the shape of his 
permanent sensory region in a 
fashion that Odeen eventually 
associated with amusement or 
pleasure. “No. No Mid-lings 
either. Just Hard Ones of one 
kind.” 

Odeen had to ask. It came out 
involuntarily, quite against his 
desire. 

“But how do you stand it?” 

“It is different with us, Little- 
left. We are used to it.” 

Could Odeen become used to 
such a concept? There was the 
Parental triad that had filled his 
life so far and the sure knowledge 
that he would at some not-too- 
distant time form a triad of his 
own. What was life without that T 
He thought about it hard now and 
then. He thought about everything 
hard, as it came up. Sometimes he 
managed to catch a glimpse of 
what it might mean. That Hard 
Ones had only themselves — not 
left-brother or right-brother or 
mid-sister or melting or children 
or Parentals. They had only the 
mind, only the inquiry into the 
Universe. 

Perhaps that was enough for 
them. As Odeen grew older he 
caught bits of understanding as to 
the joys of inquiry. They were 
almost enough — almost enough — 
and then he would think of Tritt 
and of Dua and decide that all the 



Universe besides was not quite 
enough. 

Unless— It was odd, but every 
once in a while it seemed to him 
that there might come a time, a 
situation, a condition, when — 
Then he would lose the momentary 
glimpse— or, rather, glimpse of a 
glimpse — and miss it all. Yet in 
time it would return, and lately he 
thought the concept grew stronger 
and would remain almost long 
enough to be caught. 

B UT none of that was what 
should involve him now. He 
had to see about Dua. He made his 
way along the familiar route, along 
which he had first been taken by 
his Parental (as Tritt would soon 
take their own young Rational, 
their own baby-left.) 

And he was instantly lost in 
memory again. 

The occasion had been frighten- 
ing. There had been other young 
Rationals, all pulsing and shimmer- 
ing and changing shape despite the 
Parental signals on every side to 
stay firm and smooth and not 
disgrace the triad. One small Left, a 
playmate of Odeen’s, had, in fact, 
flattened out baby-fashion and 
would not unflatten, despite all the 
efforts of his horribly embarrassed 
Parental. The youngster had since 
become a perfectly normal student 
— Though no Odeen, as Odeen 
himself could not help realizing 
with considerable complacency.) 

They met a number of Hard 
Ones on that first day of school. 
They paused with each so that each 
young-Rational vibration pattern 
might be recorded in several 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



27 




specialized ways and for a decision 
to be reached as to whether to 
accept any new Rational for 
instruction immediately or to wait 
another interval — and if immed- 
iately, for what kind of instruction. 

Odeen, in a desperate effort, had 
drawn himself smooth and held 
himself unwavering as a Hard 
One approached. 

The Hard One said — and the first 
sound of the odd tones of his voice 
almost undid Odeen’s determinat- 
ion to be grownup — “This is quite 
a firm-held Rational. How do you 
represent yourself, Left?” 

It was the first time Odeen had 
ever been called “left” without 
some form of diminutive. He felt 
firmer than ever as he managed to 
say, “Odeen, Hard-Sir,” using the 
polite address his Parental had 
carefully taught him. 

Dimly Odeen remembered being 
taken through the Hard Caverns, 
past their equipment, their 
machinery, their ‘libraries, their 
meaningless, crowding sights and 
sounds. More than his actual 
perceptions he remembered his 
inner feeling of despair. What 
would they do with him? 

His Parental had told him that he 
would learn, but he did not know 
what was really meant by “learn” 
and when he asked his Parental it 
turned out that the older one did 
not know either. 

It took Odeen a while to find out 
and the experience was pleasur- 
able, so pleasurable — and yet not 
without its worrisome aspects. 

The Hard One who had first 
called him “left” was his first 
teacher. The Hard One taught him 



to interpret the wave recordings so 
that after a while what seemed an 
incomprehensible code became 
words — words just as clear as those 
he could form with his own 
vibrations. 

But then that first mentor failed 
to appear and another Hard One 
took over. It was a time before 
Odeen noticed. It was difficult for 
him in those early days to tell one 
Hard One from another, to dif- 
ferentiate among their voices. But 
then he grew certain. Little by 
little he grew certain and tie trem- 
bled at the change. He did not un- 
derstand its significance. 

He gathered courage and finally 
asked, “Where is my teacher, 
Hard-Sir?” 

“Gamaldan? He will no longer 
be with you, Left.” 

Odeen was speechless for a mo- 
ment. Then he asked, “But Hard 
Ones don’t pass on — ” He did not 
quite finish the phrase. 

The new Hard One said nothing, 
volunteered nothing. 

It was always to be like that, 
Odeen found out. They never talked 
about themselves. On every other 
subject they discoursed freely. Con- 
cerning themselves — nothing. 

From dozens of pieces of evi- 
dence Odeen could not help but 
decide that Hard Ones passed on, 
that they were not immortal (some- 
thing so many Soft Ones took for 
granted). Yet no Hard One ever 
confirmed his conclusion in words. 
Odeen and the other student Ra- 
tional sometimes discussed it hes- 
itantly, uneasily. Each brought in 
some small item that pointed inex- 
orably to the mortality of the Hard 



28 



IF 




Ones and wondered and did not like 
to conclude the obvious and let it 
go. 

The Hard Ones did not seem to 
mind that hints of mortality existed. 
They did nothing to mask them. 
But they never mentioned them 
either. And if the question was 
asked directly (sometimes it inev- 
itably was) they never answered— 
neither denying nor affirming. 

If they passed on they had to be 
born also— yet they said nothing 
of that and Odeen never saw a 
young Hard One. 

O DEEN believed the Hard 
Ones received their energy 
from rocks instead of from the 
Sun— at least that they incorpo- 
rated a powdered black rock into 
their bodies. Some of the other 
students thought so, too. Others, 
rather vehemently, refused to ac- 
cept the theory. But no one could 
come to a conclusion, for no one 
ever saw a Hard One feeding in 
any manner and the Hard Ones 
never spoke of that either. 

In the end Odeen took their 
reticence for granted — as part of 
them. Perhaps, he thought, it was 
their individuality, the fact that 
they formed no triads. It built a 
shell about them. 

And then, too, Odeen learned 
things of such grave import that 
questions concerning the private 
lives of the Hard Ones turned to 
trivia. He learned, for instance, 
that the whole world was shrivel- 
ing — dwindling. 

Losten, his new teacher, told 
him that. 

Odeen has asked about the un- 



occupied caverns that stretched so 
endlessly into the bowels of the 
world and Losten had seemed 
pleased. 

“Are you afraid to ask about 
them, Odeen?” 

(He was Odeen now— not merely 
identified by some reference to his 
lefthood. It was always a source, of 
pride to him to hear a Hard One 
address him by name. Many did so. 
Odeen was a prodigy of under- 
standing and the use of his name 
seemed a recognition of the fact. 
More than once Losten had ex- 
pressed satisfaction at having him 
as a pupil.) 

Odeen was indeed afraid and, 
after some hesitation, said so. It 
was always easier to confess short- 
comings to the Hard Ones than to 
fellow Rationals — much easier than 
to confess them to Tritt, unthink- 
able to confess them to Tritt. 

“Then why do you ask?” 

Odeen hesitated again. Then 
said slowly, “I’m afraid of the un- 
occupied caverns because when I 
was youqg I was told they had all 
sorts of monstrous things in them. 
But I know nothing of that directly 
—I only know what I have been 
told by other young ones who 
couldn’t have known directly either. 
I want to find out the truth about 
them and the wanting has grown 
until there is more curiosity in me 
than fear.” 

Losten looked pleased. “Good. 
The curiosity is useful, the fear 
useless. Your inner development is 
excellent, Odeen, and remember it 
is only your inner development 
that counts in the important things. 
Our help to you is marginal. Since 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



29 




you want to know it is easy to tell 
you that the unoccupied caverns are 
truly unoccupied. They are empty. 
There is nothing in them but the 
unimportant things left behind 
from times past.” 

“Left behind by whom, Hard- 
Sir?” Odeen felt uneasily com- 
pelled to use the honorific when- 
ever he was too obviously in the 
presence of knowledge he. lacked 
that the other had. 

“By those who occupied them in 
times past. There was a time thou- 
sands of cycles ago when there were 
many thousands of Hard Ones and 
millions of Soft Ones. There are 
fewer of us now than there were in 
the past, Odeen. Nowadays there 
are not quite three hundred Hard 
Ones and fewer than ten thousand 
Soft Ones.” 

“Why?” asked Odeen, shocked. 
(Only three hundred Hard Ones 
left— surely an open admission that 
Hard Ones, passed on, but this was 
not the time to think of that.) 

“Because energy is diminishing. 
The Sun is cooling. It becomes 
harder in every cycle to give birth 
and to live.” 

(Well, then, did not the words 
mean the Hard Ones gave birth, 
too? And did it mean that the Hard 
-Ones depended on the Sun for food, 
too, and not on rocks? Odeen filed 
the thought for later reference and 
dismissed it for now.) 

“Will this continue?” Odeen 
asked. 

“The Sun must dwindle to an 
end, Odeen, and some day give no 
food.” 

“Does that mean that all of us, 
the Hard Ones and the Soft Ones, 



too, ultimately will pass on?” 
“What else can it mean?” 

“We can’t all pass on. If we need 
energy and theJSun is coming to an 
end we must find other sources. 
Other stars.” 

“But, Odeen, all the stars are 
coming to an end. The Universe is 
coming to an end.” 

“If the stars come to an end, is 
there no food elsewhere? No other 
source of energy?” 

“No, all the sources of energy in 
the Universe are coming to an end.” 
Odeen considered that rebel- 
liously, then said, “Then other 
Universes. We can’t give ' up just 
because the Universe does.” He 
was palpitating as he said it. He had 
expanded with quite unforgivable 
discourtesy until he had swelled 
translucently into a size distinctly 
larger than the Hard One. 

But Losten merely expressed 
extreme pleasure. He said, “Won- 
derful, my Left-dear. The others 
must hear of this.” 

Odeen had collapsed to normal 
size in mingled embarrassment and 
pleasure at hearing himself ad- 
dressed as “Left-dear.” 

Not very long after that conver- 
sation Losten himself had brought 
them Dua. Odeen had wondered 
idly if there had been any connec- 
tion, but after a while his wonder 
burned itself out. Tritt had repeated 
so often that it was his own ap- 
proach to Losten that had brought 
them Dua that Odeen had given up 
thinking about it. 

But now he was coming to Losten 
again. A long time had passed since 
those earlier days when he first 
learned that the Universe was com- 



30 



IF 




ing to an end and that (as it turned 
out) the Hard Ones were resolutely 
laboring to live on anyway. He had 
become an adept in many fields and 
Losten himself confessed that in 
physics there was little he could any 
longer teach Odeen that a Soft One 
could profitably learn. And there 
were other young Rationals to take 
in hand, so he did not see Losten as 
frequently as he once did. 



O DEEN found Losten with two 
half-grown Rationals in the 
Radiation Chamber. Losten saw 
him at once through the glass and 
came out, closing the door carefully 
about him. 

“My Left-dear,” he said, holding 
out his limbs in a gesture of friend- 
ship (so that Odeen, as so often in 
the past, experienced a perverse 
desire to touch, but controlled it.) 
“How are ybu?” 

“I did not mean to interrupt, 
Losten-Sir.” 

“Interrupt? Those two will get 
along perfectly well by themselves 
for a time. They are probably glad 
to see me go, for I am sure 1 wegry 
them with too much talk.” 
“Nonsense,” said Odeen. “You 
always fascinated me and I’m sure 
you fascinate them.” 

“Well, well. It is good of you to 
say so. I see you frequently in the 
library and I hear from others that 
you do well in your advanced 
courses — and I miss my best stu- 
dent. How is Tritt? Is he as Paren- 
tally stubborn in his ways as ever?” 
“More stubborn every day. He 
gives strength to the triad.” 

“And Dua?” 



“Dua? I have come— She is very 
unusual, you know.” 

Losten nodded, “Yes, I know 
that.” His expression was one that 
Odeen had grown to associate with 
melancholy. 

Odeen waited a moment, then 
decided to tackle the matter di- 
rectly. He asked, “Losten-Sir, was 
she brought to us, to Tritt and my- 
self, just because she was unusual?” 

Losten said, “Would you be sur- 
prised? You are quite unusual 
yourself, Odeen, and you have told 
me on a number of occasions that 
Tritt is.” 

“Yes,” said Odeen with con- 
viction. “He is.” 

‘“Then ought not your triad in- 
clude an unusual Emotional?” . 

“There are many ways of being 
unusual,” said Odeen thoughtfully. 
“In some ways Dua’s oddness dis- 
pleases Tritt and worries me. May I 
consult you?” 

“Always.” 

“She is not fond of — of melting.” 

Losten listened gravely, to all 
appearances unembarrassed. 

Odeen went on: “She is fond of 
melting when we melt, that is, but it 
is not always easy to persuade her 
to do so.” 

Losten said, “How does Tritt feel 
about melting? I mean, aside from 
the immediate pleasure of the act? 
What does it mean to him besides 
pleasure?” 

“Children, of course,” said 
Odeen. “I like them and Dua likes 
them, too, but Tritt is the Parental. 
Do you understand that?” (It sud- 
denly seemed to Odeen that Losten 
could not possibly understand all 
the subtleties of the triad.) 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



31 




“I try to understand,” said Los- 
ten. “It seems to me, then, that 
Tritt gets more out of melting than 
melting alone. And how about you? 
What do you get out of it besides 
the pleasure?” 

Odeen considered. “I think 
you know. A kind of mental 
stimulation.” 

“Yes, I know— but I want to 
make sure you know. I want to 
make sure you haven’t forgotten. 
You have told me often that when 
you came out of a period of melting 
and its odd loss of time — during 
which. I admit I sometimes didn’t 
see you for rather long periods — 
you suddenly found yourself under- 
standing many things that had 
seemed obscure before.” 

“It was as though my mind re- 
mained active in the interval,” said 
Odeen. “It was as though the time 
spent — even though I was unaware 
of its passing and unconscious of 
my existence — were necessary to 
me. During melting I could ap- 
parently think more deeply and 
intensely — without the distraction 
of the less intellectual side of life.” 
“Yes,” agreed Losten, “and 
you’d, come back with a quantum- 
jump in understanding. It is a 
common thing among you Ration- 
al, though I must admit no one 
improved in such great leaps as 
you. I honestly think that no Ra- 
tional in history has done so.” 
“Really?” Odeen tried not to 
seem unduly elated. 

“On the other hand, I may be 
wrong.” Losten seemed slightly 
amused at Odeen’s sudden loss of 
shimmer. “But never mind that. 
The point is that you, like Tritt, get 



something out of the melt beside 
the melt itself.” 

“Yes. Most certainly.” 

“And what does Dua get out of 
the melt besides the melt?” 

There was a long pause. 

“I don’t know,” said Odeen. 
“Have you never asked her?” 
“Never.” 

“But then,” said Losten, “if all 
she gets out of a melt is the melt 
and if you and Tritt get out of it the 
melt plus something else— why 
should she be as eager for it as you 
two are?” 

“Other Emotionals don’t seem 
to require—” began Odeen 
defensively. 

“Other Emotionals are not like 
Dua. You’ve ’ told me that 
often enough and, I think, with 
satisfaction.” 

O DEEN felt ashamed. “I had 
thought it might be something 

else.” 

“What might that be?” 

“It’s hard to explain. We know 
each other in the triad — we sense 
each other. In some ways all three 
of us are part of a single individual. 
A misty individual that comes and 
goes. Mostly the feeling is sub- 
conscious. If we think about it with 
too great a concentration we lose 
it, so we can never get real detail. 
We — ” Odeen stopped rather hope- 
lessly. “It’s hard to explain the 
triad to someone — ” 

“I am trying to understand. You 
think you have caught a portion of 
Dua’s inner mind, something she 
has tried to keep secret — is that it?” 
“I’m not sure. It is the vaguest 
impression, sensed with a corner of 



32 



IF 




my mind just now and then.” 

“Well?” 

“I sometimes think Dua doesn’t 
want to start a baby-Emotional.” 

Losten looked at him gravely. 
“You only have two children so 
far, I think. A little-left and a little- 
right.” 

“Yes, only two. The Emotional is 
difficult to initiate, you know.” 

“I know.” 

“And Dua will not trouble to 
absorb the necessary energy. Or 
even try to. She has any number of 
reasons but I can’t believe any of 
them. It seems to me that for some 
reason she just doesn’t want an 
Emotional. For myself— if Dua 
really didn’t want one for a while — 
well, I would let her have her Way. 
But Tritt is a Parental and he wants 
one. He must have one and some- 
how I can’t disappoint Tritt, not 
even for Dua,” 

“If Dua had some rational cause 
for not wanting to initiate an 
Emotional, would that make a 
difference with you?” 

“With me, certainly, but not with 
Tritt. He doesn’t understand such 
things.” 

“But would you labor to keep 
him patient?” 

“Yes, I would — for as long as I 
could.” 

Losten said, “Has it occurred to 
you that hardly any Soft Ones—” 
he hesitated as though searching for. 
a word and then used the customary 
Soft-One phrase — “ever pass on 
before the children are born— all 
three, with the baby-Emotional 
last?” 

“Yes, I know.” Odeen wondered 
how Losten could possibly think 

THE GODS THEMSELVES 



him ignorant of so elementary a bit 
of knowledge. 

“Then the birth of a baby- 
Emotional is equivalent to the 
coming of time to pass on.” 
“Usually not till the Emotional 
is old enough—” 

“But the time for passing on will 
be coming. Might it not be that 
Dua does not want to pass on?” 
“How can that be, Losten?” 
When the time comes to pass on, it 
is as when the time comes to melt. 
How can you not want to?” (Hard 
Ones did not melt — perhaps they 
did not understand.) 

“Suppose Dua simply wants 
never to pass on? What would you 
then say?” 

“Why, that we must pass on 
eventually. If Dua merely wants to 
delay the last baby I might humor 
her and even persuade Tritt to— 
perhaps. If she wants never to have 
it— that simply cannot be allowed.” 
“Why so?” 

Odeen paused to think it out. “I 
can’t say, Losten-Sir, but I know 
we must pass on. I know it more 
and feel it more with each cycle, 
and sometimes I almost think I 
understand why.” 

“You are a philosopher I some- 
times think, Odeen,” said Losten 
dryly. ‘"‘Let’s consider. By the time 
the third baby comes and grows, 
Tritt will have had all his children 
and can look forward to passing on 
after a fulfilled life. You yourself 
will have had the satisfaction of 
much learning and you, too, can 
pass on after a fulfilled life. But 
Dua?” 

“I don’t know,” said Odeen 
wretchedly. “Other Emotionals 

33 




cling together and seem to get 
some pleasure out of chattering 
with each other. Dua, however, will 
not do so.” 

“Well, she is unusual. Is there 
nothing she likes?” 

“She likes to listen to me talk 
about my work,” mumbled Odeen. 

Losten said, “Well, don’t be 
ashamed of that, Odeen. Every 
Rational talks about his work to 
his right and his mid. You all pre- 
tend you don’t but you all do.” 
Odeen said, “But Dua listens, 
Losten-Sir.” 

“I’m quite sure she does. Not like 
other Emotionals. And does it ever 
seem to you that she understands 
rather better after a melt?” 

“Yes, I have noticed that at 
times. I didn’t pay any particular 
attention, though—” 

“Because you are sure Emotion- 
als can’t really understand these 
things. But there seems to be much 
of the Rational in Dua.” 

(Odeen looked up at Losten with 
sudden consternation. Once Du$ 
had told him of her childhood un- 
happiness — only once — of the 

shrill calls of the other Emotionals 
and of the filthy name they had 
called her — Left-Em. Had Losten 
heard of that, somehow? But he vyas 
merely looking calmly at Odeen.) 

Odeen said, “I have sometimes 
thought that, too.” Then he burst 
out with: “I am proud of her for 
that.” 

“Nothing wrong with that,” said 
Losten. “Why not tell her so? And 
if she likes to pamper the Rational- 
ness in herself— why not let her? 
Teach her what you know more 
intensively. Answer her questions. 



Will it disgrace your triad to do 
that?” 

“I don’t care if it does. And why 
should it? Tritt will think it a waste 
of time, but I’ll handle him.” 

“Explain to him that if Dua gets 
more out of life and a truer sense of 
fulfillment she might not have the 
fear of passing on that she now has 
and might be more ready to have a 
baby-Emotional.” 

It was as though an enormous 
feeling of impending disaster had 
been lifted from Odeen. He said 
hurriedly, “You’re right. I feel 
you’re right. Losten-Sir, you under- 
stand so much. With you leading 
the Hard Ones, how can we fail to 
continue succeeding in the other- 
Universe project?” 

“With me?” Losten was amused. 
“You forget it is Estwald who is 
guiding us now. He is the real hero 
of the project. It would be nowhere 
without him.” 

“Oh, yes 4 ” said Odeen, momen- 
tarily discomfited. He had never yet 
seen Estwald. In fact, he had not 
yet met a Soft One who had actu- 
ally met him, though some re- 
ported having seen him in the 
distance now and then. Estwald 
was a new Hard One — new, at 
least, in the sense that when Odeen 
had been young he had never heard 
Estwald mentioned. Did that mean 
that Estwald was a young Hard 
One, had been a child Hard One 
when Odeen had been a child Soft 
One? 

But never mind that. Right now, 
Odeen wanted to get back home. 
He could not touch Losten in grat- 
itude, but he dould thank him again 
and then hasten away joyfully. 



34 



IF 




His joy had a selfish component. 
It was not put there merely by the 
distant prospect of th€ baby- 
Emotional and the thought of 
Tritt’s pleasure. It was not even 
caused by the thought of Dua’s 
fulfillment. What counted with him 
at this very moment was the imme- 
diate gleeful prospect ahead. He 
was going to be able to teach. No 
other Rational could feel the 
pleasure of so doing, he was sure, 
for no other Rational could possi- 
bly have an Emotional like Dua as 
part of the triad. 

It would be wonderful, if only 
Tritt could be made to understand 
the necessity. He would have to 
talk to Tritt, somehow persuade 
him to be patient. 

2c 

T RITT had never felt less pa- 
tient. He did not pretend to 
understand why Dua acted as she 
did. He did not want to try. He did 
not care. He never knew why 
Emotionals did what they did. And 
Dua did not even act like the other 
Emotionals. 

She never thought about the 
important thing. She would look at 
the Sun. But then she would thin 
out so that the light and food would 
simply pass through her. Then she 
would say it was beautiful. That 
was not the important thing. The 
important thing was to eat. What 
was beautiful about eating? What 
wasjbeautiful? 

She always wanted to melt dif^ 
ferently. Once she said, “Let’s talk 
first. We never talk about it. We 
never think about it.” 



Odeen would always say, “Let 
her have ter way, Tritt. It makes 
the melting better.” 

Odeen was always patient. He 
always thought things would be 
better after a wait. Or else he would 
want to think matters out. 

Tritt was not sure he knew what 
Odeen meant by “thinking out.” It 
seemed to him it just meant that 
Odeen did nothing. 

Like getting Dua in the first 
place. Odeen would stll be thinking 
it out. Tritt had gone right up to a 
Hard One and asked. That was the 
way to act. 

Now Odeen would do nothing 
about Dua. What about the baby- 
Emotional? Well, Tritt would do 
something about it, if Odeen didn’t. 

In fact, he v was doing something. 
He was edging down the long cor- 
ridor even as all this was going, 
through his mind. He was hardly 
aware he had come this far. Was, 
this “thinking out?” Well— he 
would not let himself be frightened. 
He would not back away. 

He looked about him stolidly. 
This was the way to the Hard 
Caverns. He knew he would be 
going that way with his little-left 
before very long. He had been 
shown the way by Odeen once. 

He did not know what he would 
do when he got there this time. 
Still, he felt no fright at all. He 
wanted a baby-Emotional. It was 
his right to have a baby-Emotional. 
Nothing was more important than 
that. The Hard Ones would see he 
got oner Had they not brought Dua 
when he had asked? 

But whom would he ask? Could 
he speak to any Hard One? Dimly 



THE GODS TH EMSELVES 



35 




he had made up his mind not to ask 
just any Hard One. There was the 
name of one he would ask for. 

He remembered the name. He 
even remembered when he had first 
heard the name. It was the time 
when the little-left had grown old 
enough to begin changing shape 
voluntarily. (What a great day! 
“Come, Odeen, quickly! Annis is 
all oval and hard. All by himself, 
too. Dua, look!” And they had 
rushed in. Annis had been the only 
child then. They had had to wait so 
long for the second. So they rushed 
in and he was just plastered in the 
corner. He was curling at himself 
and flowing over his resting place 
like wet clay. Odeen had left be- 
cause he was busy. But Dua had 
said, “Oh, he’ll do it again, Tritt.” 
They had watched for hours and he 
didn’t.) 

Tritt was hurt that Odeen hadn’t 
waited. He would have scolded but 
Odeen had looked so weary. There 
had been definite wrinkles in his 
ovoid. And he had made no effort 
to smooth 'them out. 

Tri k tt had asked anxiously, “Is 
anything wrong, Odeen?’’ 

“A hard day and I’m not sure 
I’m going to get differential equa- 
tions before the next melting.’’ 
(Tritt did not remeiqber the exact 
hard words. Odeen always used 
hard words.) 

“Do you want to melt now?’’ 

“Oh, no. I just saw Dua heading 
topside and you know how she is if 
we try to interrupt that. There’s no 
rush, really. There’s a new Hard 
One, too.’’ 

“A new Hard One?’’ Tritt had 
known a distinct lack of interest. 



Odeen found sharp interest in as- 
sociating with Hard Ones, but 
Tritt wished the interest did not 
exist. Odeen was more intent on 
what he called his education than 
any other Rational in. the area. 
That was unfair. Odeen was too 
wrapped up in that. Dua was too 
wrapped up in roaming the surface 
alone. No one was properly inter- 
ested in the triad but Tritt. 

“He’s called Estwald.’’ 
“Estwald?’’ Tritt had begun to 
feel a twinge of interest, perhaps 
because he was anxiously sensing 
Odeen’s feelings. 

“I’ve never seen him, but they 
all talk about him.’’ Odeen’s eyes 
had flattened out as they usually 
did when he turned introspective. 
“He’s responsible for that new 
thing they’ve got.’’ 

“What new thing?’’ 

“The positron Pu— You wouldn’t 
understand, Tritt. It’s a new thing 
they have. It’s going to revolution- 
ize the whole world.’’ 

“What’s revolutionize?’’ 

“Make everything different.’’ 
Tritt had been at once alarmed. 
“They mustn’t make everything 
different.’’ 

“They’ll make everything better. 
Different isn’t always worse. Any- 
way, Estwald is responsible. He’s 
very bright, I get the feeling.’’ 
“Then why don’t you like him?’’ 
“I didn’t say I didn’t like him.’’ 
“You feel as though you don’t 
like him.” 

“Oh, nothing of the sort, Tritt. 
It’s just that somehow — some- 
how — ” Odeen had laughed. “I’m 
jealous. Hard Ones are so intelli- 
gent that a Soft One is nothing in 



36 



IF 




comparison— but I got used to that 
because Losten was always telling 
me how bright I was— for a Soft 
One, I suppose. But now this 
Estwald comes along and even 
Losten seems lost in admiration. 
And I’m really nothing.” Tritt had 
bellied out his foreplane until it had 
made contact with Odeen, who had 
looked up and smiled. “But that’s 
just stupidity on my part. Who 
cares how smart a Hard One is? 
Not one of them has a tritt.” 

Then they both had gone looking 
for Dua, after all. For a wonder she^ 
had finished wandering about — 
they had met her as she was head- 
ing down again. It had been a very 
good melting, though the time- 
lapse had been only a day or so. 
Tritt had worried about meltings 
then. With Annis so small even a 
short absence had been risky, 
though there were always other 
Parentals who would take over if 
necessary. 

After that Odeen had mentioned 
Estwald now and then. He always 
called him “the New One” even 
after considerable time had passed. 
He still had never seen him. “I 
think I’m avoiding him,” he had 
said once when Dua was with them, 
“because he knows so much about 
the new device. I don’t want to find 
out too soon. It’s too much fun to 
learn.” 

“The Positron Pump?” Dua had 
asked. 

That was another funny thing 
about Dua, Tritt thought. It an- 
noyed him. She could say the hard 
words almost as well as Odeen 
could. Strange behavior for an 
Emotional! 



S O TRITT made up his mind to 
ask Estwald because Odeen 
had said he was smart. Besides, 
Odeen had never seen him. Estwald 
could not say, “I’ve talked to 
Odeen about it, Tritt, and you 
mustn’t worry.” 

Everyone thought that if you 
talked to the Rational you were 
talking to the triad. Nobody paid 
attention to the Parentals. But 
they would have to this time. 

He was in the Hard Caverns and 
everything seemed different. 
Nothing here looked like anything 
Tritt could understand. It was all 
wrong and frightening. Still, he was 
too anxious to see Estwald to let 
himself really be frightened. He 
said to himself, “I want my little- 
mid.” That made him feel firm 
enough to walk forward. 

He saw a Hard One finally. 
There was just this one, doing 
something, bending over some- 
thing. Odeen had once told Tritt 
that Hard Ones were always 
working at their — whatever-it-was. 
Tritt did not remember and did 
not care. 

He moved smoothly up and 
stopped. “Hard-Sir,” he said. 

The Hard One looked up at him 
and the air vibrated about him, the 
way Odeen said it did when two 
Hard Ones talked to each other 
sometimes. Then the Hard One 
seemed really to see Tritt and said, 
“Why, it’s a Right. What is your 
business here? Do you have your 
little-left with you? Is today the 
start of a- semester?” 

Tritt ignored it all. He said, 
“Where can I find Estwald, Hard- 
Sir?” 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



37 




“Find whom?” 

“Estwald.” 

The Hard One was silent for a 
long moment. Then he said, “What 
is your business with Estwald, 
Right?” 

Tritt felt stubborn. “It is im- 
portant I speak to him. Are you 
Estwald, Hard-Sir?” 

“No, I am not. What is your 
name. Right?” 

“Tritt, Hard-Sir.” 

“I see. You're the Right of 
Odeen’s triad, aren’t you?” 

“Yes.” 

The Hard One’s voice seemed to 
soften. “I’m afraid you can’t see 
Estwald at the moment. He’s not 
here. If anyone else can help you — ” 
Tritt didn’t know what to say. 
He simply stood there. 

The Hard One said, “You go 
home now. Talk to Odeen. He’ll 
help you. Yes? Go home, Right.” 
The Hard One turned away. He 
seemed very concerned in matters 
other than Tritt and Tritt still stood, 
there, uncertain. Then he moved 
into another section quietly, 
flowing noiselessly. The Hard One 
did not look up. 

Tritt was not certain why he had 
moved in that particular direction. 
At first he felt only that it was good 
to dp so. Then the reason became 
clear. There was a thin warmth of 
food about him and he was nibbling 
at it. 

He had not been conscious of 
hunger, yet now he was eating 
and enjoying. 

The Sun was nowhere. Instinc- 
tively he looked up, but of course 
he was in a cavern. Yet the food 
was better than he had ever found 



it to be on the surface. He looked 
about, wondering. He wondered 
most of all that he should be 
wondering. 

He had sometimes been impa- 
tient with Odeen because Odeen 
wondered about so many things 
that did not matter. Now he him- 
self— Tritt— was wondering. But 
what he was wondering about did 
matter. Suddenly, with an almost 
blinding flash, he realized that he 
would not wonder unless something 
in him told him the subject did 
matter. 

He acted quickly, marveling at 
his own bravery. After a while he 
retraced his steps. He moved past 
the Hard One again, the one to 
whom he had earlier spoken. He 
said, “I am going home, Hard-Sir.” 

The Hard One merely said some- 
thing incoherent. He was still doing 
something, bending over something, 
doing silly things and- not seeing 
the important thing. 

If Hard Ones were so great and 
powerful and smart, Tritt thought, 
how could they be so stupid? 

3a 

D U A found herself drifting 
toward the Hard Caverns. 
Partly she wanted something to do 
now that the Sun had set, some- 
thing to keep her from returning 
home for an additional period of 
time, something to delay her having 
to listen to the importunities of 
Tritt and the half-embarrassed, 
half-resigned suggestions of Odeen. 
Partly, too, the Hard Caverns held 
an attraction for her. 

She had felt the last for a long 



38 



IF 




time, ever since she was little in 
fact and had given up trying to 
pretend it wasn’t so. Emotionals 
were not supposed to feel such 
temptations. Sometimes little Emo- 
tionals did — Dua was old enough 
and experienced enough to know 
that— but such young whims 
quickly faded or were discouraged. 

She herself, though, had con- 
tinued stubbornly curious about 
the world and the Sun and the 
caverns— anything at all — till her 
Parental had said, “You’re a queer 
one, Dua, dear. You’re a funny 
little-midling. What will become 
of you?’’ 

She hadn’t the vaguest notion at 
first of what was so queer and so 
funny about wanting to know. She 
had found out quickly enough that 
her Parental could not answer her 
questions. Once she had tried her 
Left-father, but he had shown none 
of her Parental’s soft puzzlement. 
He had snapped, “Why do you 
ask, Dua?’’ his look harshly 
inquiring. 

She had run away frightened, and 
had not asked him again. 

One day another Emotional of 
her own age had shrieked “Left- 
Em’’ at her after she had said — she 
no longer remembered what — 
something that had seemed natural 
to her at the tinrfe. Dua had been 
abashed without knowing why and 
had asked her considerably older 
Left-brother, what a Left-Em was. 
He had withdrawn, embarrassed 
and mumbling, “I don’t know — ’’ 
when it was obvious he did. 

After some thought she had gone 
to her Parental and asked, “Am I 
a Left-Em, daddy?’’ 



And he had said, “Who called 
you that, Dua? You must not 
repeat such words.’’ 

She flowed herself about his near 
corner, thought about it a while 
and asked, “Is it bad?’’ 

He said, “You’ll grow out of 
it—’’ and let himself bulge a bit to 
make her swing outward and 
vibrate in the game she had always 
loved. She did not love it now, for 
it was quite clear that he hadn’t 
answered her, really. She moved 
away thoughtfully. He had said, 
you’ll grow out of it, so she was in 
it now, but in what ? 

Even then, she had had few real 
friends among the other Emo- 
tionals. They liked to whisper and 
giggle together, but she preferred 
flowing over the crumbled rocks, 
and enjoying the sensation of their 
roughness. Some mids, however, 
were more friendly than others and 
less provoking. There was Doral, 
as silly as the rest, really, but who 
would sometimes chatter amus- 
ingly. (Doral had grown up to join a 
triad with Dua’s Right-brother and 
a young Left from another cavern 
complex, a Left whom Dua did not 
particularly like.. Doral had then 
gone on to initiate a baby-left and 
baby-right in rapid succession and 
a baby-mid not too long after that. 
She had also grown so dense that 
the triad looked as though it had 
two Parentals and Dua wondered 
if they could still melt. Tritt was. 
always telling her pointedly what a 
good triad Doral helped make up.) 

She and Doral had sat alone one 
day and Dua had whispered, 
“Doral, do you know what a Left- 
Em is?” 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



39 




Doral had tittered and com- 
pressed herself, as though to avoid 
being seen. She had said, “ It’s an 
Emotional that acts like a Rational 
— you know, like a Left. Get it? 
Left-Emotional — Left-Em. Get it?” 
Of course Dua understood. It was 
obvious once explained. She would 
have seen it for herself at once if 
she had been able to bring herself 
to imagine such a state of affairs. 
Dua asked, “How do you know?” 
“The older girls told me.” 
Doral’s substance swirled and Dua 
found the motion unpleasant. “It’s 
dirty,” Doral said. 

“Why?” asked Dua. 

“Because it’s dirty. Emotionals 
shouldn’t act like Rationals.” 

Dua had never thought about the 
possibility, but now she did. She 
said, “Why shouldn’t they?” 
“Because. You want to know 
something else that’s dirty?” 

Dua couldn’t help being in- 
trigued. “What?” 

Doral didn’t say anything, but a 
portion of herself expanded sud- 
denly and brushed against the 
unsuspecting Dua before the latter 
could form a concavity to elude the 
touch. Dua didn’t like it. 

She shrank away and said, 
“Don’t do that.” 

“You know what else is dirty? 
You can go into a rock.” 

“No, you can’t,” said Dua. It 
had been a silly thing to say for Dua 
had often moved through the outer 
surface of the rock and liked it. But 
now in the context of Doral’ s 
snickering she felt revolted and 
denied the whole thing even to 
herself. 

“Yes, you can. It’s called rock- 



rubbing. Emotionals can do it 
easy. Lefts and Rights can only do 
it as babies. When they grow up, 
they do it with each other.” 

“I don’t believe you. You’re 
making it up.” 

“They do, I tell you. Do you 
know Dimit?” 

“No.” 

“Sure you do. She’s the one with 
the thick corner from Cavern C.” 
“Is she the one who flows funny?” 
“Yes. On account of the thick 
corner. That’s the one. She got into 
a rock all the way once — except for 
the thick corner. She let her Left- 
brother watch her do it and he told 
their Parental and what she got for 
that\, She never did it again,” 

Dua left then, quite upset. She 
didn’t talk to Doral again for a 
long time and never really grew 
friendly with Doral again. Yet her 
curiosity had been aroused. 

Her curiosity? Why not say her 
Left-Emishness? 

O NE day when she was quite 
sure her Parental was not in 
the vicinity she let herself melt into 
a rock, slowly. It had been the first 
time she had tried it since she was 
quite young. There was a warmness 
about the sensation, but when she 
emerged she felt as though every- 
one could tell, as though the rock 
had left a stain on her. 

She tried it again now and then, 
more boldly, and let herself enjoy 
it more. She never sank in really 
deeply, of course. 

Eventually she was caught by her 
Parental who clucked in displeasure 
and she was more careful after that. 
She was older now and knew for 



40 



IF 




certain fact that, despite Doral’s 
snickering, the practice was not 
uncommon. Practically every Emo- 
tional indulged in it now and then 
and some quite openly admitted 
the fact. 

Such practices happened less 
frequently as Emotionals grew 
older and Dua did not think that 
any Emotional she^ knew ever in- 
dulged after joining a triad and 
beginning the proper meltings. It 
was one of her secrets (she never 
told anybody) that she had kept it 
up and that once or twice she had 
tried it even after triad-formation. 
(Those few times she had thought: 
What if Tritt finds out? Somehow 
the prospect seemed to present 
formidable consequences and 
rather spoiled the fun.) 

She found excuses for herself in 
her ordeals with the others. The cry 
of “Left-Em” drove her into an 
almost hermitlike isolation at one 
point and, being alone, she found 
consolation in the rocks. Rock- 
rubbing, whether it was dirty or 
not, was a solitary act and they 
were forcing, her to be solitary. 

Or so -she told herself. 

She had tried to strike back once. 
She had cried out, “You’re a^bunch 
of Right-Ems, a bunch of dirty 
Right-Ems,” at the taunting mids. 

They had only laughed and Dua 
had run away in confusion and 
frustration. But she had been right. 
Almost every Emotional, when she 
reached the age of triad-formation, 
became interested in babies, 
fluttering about them in Parental 
imitation Dua had found repulsive. 
She herself had never felt such 
interest. Babies were only babies — 



they were for right-brothers to 
worry about. 

The name-calling died as Dua 
grew older. It helped that she re- 
tained a girlishly rarefied structure 
and could flow with a smoky curl 
no others could duplicate. And 
when, increasingly, Lefts and Rights 
showed interest in her, the other 
Emotionals found it difficult to 
sneer. 

And yet— and yet — now that no 
one ever dared speak disrespect- 
fully to Dua (for it was well known 
through all the caverns that Odeen 
was the most prominent Rational 
of the generation and Dua was his 
Mid-ling), she herself knew that 
she was a Left-Em past all 
redemption. 

She did not think that being one 
was dirty — not really — but occa- 
sionally she caught herself wishing 
she were a Rational and then she 
was abashed. She wondered if — 
partly — she didn’t want a baby- 
Emotional because she was not a 
real Emotional herself and did not 
fill her triad role properly. 

Odeen had not minded her being 
a Left-Em. He never called her 
one— but he liked her interest in 
his life, liked her questions and the 
way she could understand. He even 
defended her when Tritt grew 
jealous— well, not jealous, really— 
but overwhelmed with a feeling 
that the situation did not fit his 
stubborn and limited outlook. 

O DEEN had taken her to the 
Hard Caverns occasionally, 
eager to posture before Dua and 
openly pleased that Dua was im- 
pressed. And she was impressed, 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



41 




not so much with the clear fact of 
his knowledge and intelligence, but 
with the fact that he did not resent 
sharing it. (She remembered her 
left-father’s harsh response that 
one time she had questioned him.) 
She never loved Odeen as much as 
when he let her share his life— yet 
even that was part of her Left- 
Emishness. 

Perhaps (this had occurred to her 
over and over) by being Left-Emish, 
she moved closer to Odeen and 
farther from Tritt and this was 
another reason Tritt’s impor- 
tunities repelled her. 

Her first time in a Hard Cavern 
she heard two Hard Ones talking. 
She did not know they were talk- 
ing, of course. There was air vi- 
bration, rapid and changing, that 
made an unpleasant buzz deep 
inside her. She had to rarefy and 
let it through. 

Odeen said, “They’re talking.’’ 
Then, hastily, anticipating her 
objection: “Their kind of talk. 
They understand each other.’’ 

Dua managed to grasp the con- 
cept. It was all the more delightful 
to understand quickly because that 
pleased Odeen so. (He once said, 
“None of the other Rationals I’ve 
ever met have anything but an 
empty-head for an Emotional. I’m 
lucky.’’ She had said, “But the 
other Rationals seem to like empty- 
heads. Why are you different from 
them, Odeen?’’ Odeen did not deny 
that the other Rationals liked 
empty-heads. He simply said, “I’ve 
never figured it out and I don’t 
think it’s important that I do. I’m 
pleased with you and I’m pleased 
that I’m pleased.’’) 



She said, “Can you understand 
Hard-One talk?’’ / 

“Not really,’’ said Odeen. “I 
can’t sense the changes fast enough. 
Sometimes I can get a feel for 
what they’re saying, even without 
understanding, especially after 
we’ve melted. Just sometimes, 
though. Getting feels like that is 
really an Emotional trick, except 
even if an Emotional does it, she 
can never make real sense out of 
what she’s feeling. You might, 
though.’’ 

Dua demurred. “I’d be afraid to. 
They might not like it.” 

“Oh, go on. I’m curious. See if 
you can tell what they’re talking 
about.” 

“Shall I? Really?” 

“Go ahead. If they catch you and 
are annoyed. I’ll say I made you 
do it.” 

“Promise?” 

“I promise.” 

Feeling rather fluttery, Dua let 
herself reach out to the Hard Ones 
and adopted the total passivity that 
allowed the influx of feelings. 

She said, “Excitement. They’re 
excited. Someone new.” 

Odeen said, “Maybe that’s 
Estwald.” 

It was the first time Dua had 
h^ard the name. She said, “That’s 
funny.” 

“What’s funny?” 

“I have the feeling of a big Sun. 
A really big Sun.” 

Odeen looked thoughtful. “They 
might be talking about that.” 

“But how can that be?” 

J UST then the Hard Ones spied 
them, approached and greeted 



42 



IF 




them in Soft-One fashion of speech. 
Dua’ was horribly embarrassed and 
wondered if they knew she had been 
sensing them. If they did, though, 
they said nothing. 

(Odeen told her afterward that it 
was quite rare to come upon Hard 
Ones talking among themselves in 
their own fashion. They always 
deferred to the Soft Ones and 
seemed always to suspend their 
own talk when Soft Ones were 
there. “They like us so much,” said 
Odeen. “They are very kind.”) 

Once in a while he would take her 
deep into the Hard Caverns — 
usually when Tritt was entirely 
wrapped up in the children. Odeen 
did not go out of his way to tell 
Tritt that he had taken Dua down— 
to do so would have been sure to 
evoke some response to the effect 
that Odeen’s coddling simply en- 
couraged DuaY reluctance to Sun 
herself and just made the melting 
that much more ineffective. It was 
hard to talk to Tritt for more than 
five minutes without melting 
coming into the conversation. 

She had even gone down alone 
once or twice. Doing so had always 
frightened her a little, though the 
Hard Ones she met were always 
friendly, always “very kind” as 
Odeen said. But they did not seem 
to take her seriously. They were 
pleased, but somehow amused — she 
could feel that definitely — when she 
asked questions. And when they 
answered it was in some Simple 
way that carried no information. 
“Just a machine, Dua,” they would 
say. “Odeen might be able to tell 
you.” 

She wondered if she had met 
THE GODS THEMSELVES 



Estwald. She never quite dared to 
try to discover the names of the 
Hard Ones she met (except 
Losten’s, to whom Odeen had 
introduced her and of whom she 
heard a great deal.) Sometimes it 
seemed to her that this Hard One or 
that might be Estwald. Odeen 
talked about him with great awe 
and with some resentment. 

She gathered that Estwald was 
too deeply engaged in work of the 
profoundest importance to be in 
the caverns readily accessible to 
the Soft Ones. 

She pieced together what Odeen 
told her and, little by little, dis- 
covered, that the world needed food 
badly.. Odeen hardly ever called it 
“food.” He said “energy” instead 
and said it was the Hard-One word 
for it. 

The Sun was fading and dying 
but Estwald had discovered how to 
find energy far away, far beyond 
the Sun, far beyond the seven stars 
that shone in the dark night sky. 
(Odeen said the seven stars were 
seven Suns that were very distant 
and that there were many other 
stars that were even more distant 
and were too dim to be seen. Tritt 
had heard him say that and had 
asked what use it was for stars to 
exist if they coyld not be seen and 
had said he didn't believe a word of 
what Odeen was saying.) 

It looked now as though there 
would be.plenty of energy forever — 
at least as soon as Estwald and the 
other Hard Ones learned to make 
the new energy taste right. 

Only a few days ago she had 
asked Odeen, “Do you remember, 
long ago, when you took me to the 

43 




Hard Caverns and I sensed the 
Hard Ones and said I caught the 
feeling of a big Sun?” 

Odeen had looked puzzled for a 
moment. “I’m not sure. But go 
ahead, Dua. What about it?” 

“I’ve been thinking. Is the big 
Sun the source of the new energy?” 
Odeen had said happily, ‘That’s 
good, Dua. It’s not quite right, but 
that’s such good intuition for an 
Emotional.” 

D UA had been moving slowly, 
rather moodily, during her 
reveries. Without particularly 
noting the passage of either time 
or space she found herself in the 
Hard Caverns and was just begin- 
ning to wonder if she had not really 
delayed as long as she safely could 
and whether she had not best turn 
home and face the inevitable 
annoyance of Tritt when — almost 
as though the thought of Tritt had 
brought it about — she sensed Tritt. 

The sensation was so strong that 
she knew only one confused 
moment of thinking that somehow 
she was picking up his feelings far 
away in the home cavern. No — he 
was here, down here in the Hard 
Caverns with her. 

But what could he be doing here? 
Was he pursuing her? Was he going 
to quarrel with her here? Was he 
foolishly going to appeal to the 
Hard Ones? Dua did not think she 
could endure that. 

And then the feeling of cold 
horror left her and was replaced by 
astonishment. Tritt was not 
thinking of her at all. He had to be 
unaware of her presence. All she 
could sense about him was an over- 



whelming feeling of some sort of 
determination, mixed with fear and 
apprehension at something he 
would do. 

Dua might have penetrated 
farther and found out something, 
at least, about why he was here — 
but nothing was further from her 
thoughts. Since Tritt did not know 
she was in the vicinity she wanted 
to make sure of only one thing — 
that he continued not to know. 

She did, then almost in pure re- 
flex, something that a moment 
before she would not have dreamed 
of doing under any circumstances. 

Perhaps it was (she later thought) 
because of her idle reminiscences 
of that little-girl talk with Doral 
or because of her memories of her 
own experiments with rock- 
rubbing. (There was a complicated 
adult word for it but she found 
that word infinitely more embar- 
rassing than the one all the chil- 
dren had used.) 

In any case, without quite 
knowing what she was doing or, for 
a short while afterward, what she 
had done, she simply flowed hastily 
into the nearest wall. 

Into it! Every bit of her! 

The horror of what she had done 
was mitigated by the perfect 
manner in which it accomplished 
its purpose. Tritt passed by within 
touching distance and remained 
completely unaware that at one 
point he might have reached out 
and felt his Mid-ling. 

By that time Dua had no room to 
wonder what Tritt might be doing 
in the Hard Caverns if he had not 
come in pursuit of her. 

She forgot Tritt completely. 



44 



IF 




What filled her instead was pure 
astonishment at her position. Even 
in childhood she had never melted 
completely into rock or met anyone 
who admitted doing so (though 
there were invariably tales of some- 
one else who had). Certainly no 
adult Emotional ever had or could 
have acted as Dua had. She was 
unusually rarefied even For an 
Emotional (Odeen was fond of 
telling her that) and her avoidance 
of food accentuated this (as Tritt 
often said). 

What she had just done indicated 
the extent of her rarefaction more 
than any amount of Right-ling 
scolding could have managed and 
for a moment she was ashamed and 
sorry for Tritt. 

AND then she was swept by a 
xV deeper shame. What if she 
were caught? What if a Hard One 
passed and lingered? She could 
not possibly bring herself to 
emerge if anyone were watching— 
but how long could she stay in the 
rock? 

She sensed the Hard Ones and 
realized they were far away. She 
paused, strove to calm herself. The 
rock, permeating and surrounding 
her, lent a grayness to her percep- 
tions but did not dim them. In- 
deed, she sensed more sharply. 
She could still feel Tritt’s steady 
motion downward as keenly as 
though he were by her side and she 
was aware of the Hard Ones, 
though they were in a cavern com- 
plex far away. She saw the Hard 
Ones, every single one of them, 
each in his place, and caught their 
vibratory speech to the fullest de- 



tail. She even absorbed bits of what 
they were saying. 

She was sensing as never before. 

So, though she could now leave 
the rock, secure in the knowledge 
she was both alone and unobserved, 
she did not— partly out of amaze- 
ment, partly because of the curious 
exultation she felt at a new under- 
standing. She desired to experience 
it further. / 

Her sensitivity was such that she 
even knew why she was sensitive. 
Odeen had frequently remarked 
how well he understood something 
after a period of melting, even 
though he had not understood it 
at all before. Something about the 
melted state increased sensitivity 
incredibly — more was absorbed, 
more used. The reason was the 
greater atomic density during 
melting, Odeen had said. 

Even though Dua was not sure 
what “greater atomic density” 
meant, it came with melting and 
wasn’t this present situation rather 
like melting? Hadn’t Dua melted 
with rock? 

When the triad melted, all the 
sensitivity went to Odeen’s benefit. 
The Rational absorbed it, gained 
understanding and retained that 
understanding after separation. 
But now Dua was the only con- 
sciousness in the melt, which con- 
sisted of herself and the rock. 
There was “greater atomic den- 
sity” (surely?) with only herself to 
benefit. 

(Was this why rock-rubbing was 
considered a perversion? Was this 
why Emotionals were warned off? 
Or was her experience unique be- 
cause she was so rarefied? Or be- 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



45 




cause she was a Left- Em?) 

And then Dua stopped all spec- 
ulation and simply sensed— in 
fascination. She was only mechan- 
ically aware of Tritt returning, 
moving past her, passing in the 
direction from which he had come. 
She was only mechanically aware 
— scarcely feeling the vaguest 
surprise — that Odeen, too, was 
coming up from the Hard Caverns. 
She concentrated on the Hard 
Ones, trying to make the most of 
her perceptions. 

It was a long time before she 
flowed out of the rock. And when 
that time came she was not con- 
cerned overmuch about whether 
she would be observed. She was 
confident enough of her sensing 
ability to know she would not be. 

She went home deep in thought. 



3b 

O DEEN had returned to find 
Tritt waiting for him. Dua 
still had not come back. Tritt did 
not seem disturbed at that, though 
he was upset about something else. 
His emotions were strong enough 
for Odeen to sense them clearly, 
but he let them be without probing. 
Dua’s absence made him restless. 
He found himself annoyed at Tritt’s 
presence simply because Tritt was 
not Dua. 

In this he surprised himself. He 
could not deny to himself that it 
was Tritt who, of the two, was the 
dearer to him. Ideally all members 
of the triad were one and each 
member should treat the other two 
exactly on a par. Just the same, 



Odeen had never known a triad in 
which this was so. One of the three 
was always a bit on the outside and 
generally knew it, too. 

It was rarely the Emotional, 
though. Emotionals supported each 
other cross-triad to an extent that 
Rationals and Parentals never did. 
The Rational had his teacher, the 
saying went, and the Parental his 
children— but the Emotional had 
all the other Emotionals. 

Emotionals compared notes and 
if one claimed neglect or could be 
made to claim it she was sent back 
with a thin patter of instructions to 
stand firm, to demand! And be- 
cause melting depended so much 
on the Emotional and her attitude 
she was usually pampered by both 
left and right. 

But Dua was so non-Emotional 
an Emotional. She did not seem to 
care that Odeen and Tritt were so 
close and she had no close friend- 
ships among the Emotionals to 
make her care. 

Odeen loved having her so in- 
terested in h\i work, loved having 
her so concerned and so amazingly 
ready of comprehension — but that 
was an intellectual love. The 
deeper feeling went to steady, 
stupid Tritt who knew his place so 
well and who could offer so little 
other than exactly what counted 
—the security of assured routine. 

But now Odeen felt petulant. He 
asked, “Have you heard from Dua, 
Tritt?” 

Tritt did not answer directly. He 
said, “I am busy. I will see you 
later. I have been doing things.” 

“Where are the children? Have 
you been gone, too? There is a 



,46 



IF 




definite been-gone feel to you.” 

A note of annoyance made it- 
self plain in Tritt’s voice. “The 
children are well trained. They 
know enough to place themselves 
in community care. Really, Odeen, 
they are not babies.” But he did not 
deny the “been-gone” aura that he 
faintly exuded. 

“I’m sorry. I’m just anxious to 
see Dua.” 

“You should feel so more 
often,” Tritt said. “You always tell 
me to leave her alone. You look for> 
her.” And he went on into the 
deeper recesses of the home cavern. 

Odeen looked after his Right- 
ling with some surprise. On almost 
any other occasion he would have 
followed in an attempt to probe 
the unusual uneasiness that was 
making itself quite evident 
through the ingrained stolidity of 
a Parental. What had Tritt done? 

But Odeen was waiting for Dua 
and growing more anxious by the 
moment. He let Tritt go. 

Anxiety keened Odeen’s sen- 
sitivity. Rationals knew a perverse 
pride in their relative poverty of 
perception. Such perception was 
not a thing of the mind— it was 
most characteristic of Emotionals. 
Odeen was a Rational of Rationals, 
proud of reasoning rather than 
feeling, yet now he flung out the 
imperfect net of his emotional 
perception as far as he could and 
wished, for just a moment, that he 
were an Emotional and could 
send it out farther and better. 

Yet it eventually served his pur- 
pose. He could detect Dua’s ap- 
proach finally at an unusual dis- 
tance — for him — and hastened out 



to meet her. And because he made 
her out at such a distance, Jie was 
more aware of her rarefaction 
than he ordinarily was. She was a 
delicate mist, no more. 

Tritt was right, Odeen thought 
with sudden, sharp concern. Dua 
must be made to eat and to melt. 
Her interest in life must be in- 
creased. 

H E WAS so intent on the ne- 
cessity of this that when she 
flung herself flowingly toward him 
and virtually engulfed him — in 
utter disregard of the fact that they 
were not itf private and might be 
observed — and said, “Odeen, I 
must know — I must know so much 
— ” he accepted it as the comple- 
tion of his own thought and did not 
even consider it strange. 

Carefully he slipped away, trying 
to adopt a more seemly union with- 
out making it seem he was repuls- 
ing her. 

“Come,” he said. “I’ve been 
waiting for you. Tell me what you 
want to krfow. I will explain all I 
can.” 

They were moving quickly 
homeward now, with Odeen adapt- 
ing himself eagerly to the charac- 
teristic waver of the Emotional 
flow. 

Dua said, “Tell me about the 
other-Universe. Why is it dif- 
ferent? How is it different? Tell 
me all about it.” t 
It did not occur to Dua that she 
was asking too much. It did occur 
to Odeen. She felt to him rich with 
an astonishing quantity of knowl- 
edge and he was on the point of 
asking, How do you come to know 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



47 




enough about the other- Universe 
to be so curious about it? 

He repressed the question. Dua 
was coming from the direction of 
the Hard Caverns. Perhaps Losten 
had been talking to her, suspecting 
that despite everything Odeen 
would be tQO proud of his status 
to help his Mid-ling. 

Not so, thought Odeen gravely. 
And he would not ask. He would 
simply explain. 

Tritt bustled about them when 
they returned home. “If you two 
are going to talk go into Dua’s 
chamber. I will be busy out here. 
I must see to it that the children 
are cleaned and exercised. No 
time for melting now. No melt- 
ing. 

Neither Odeen nor Dua had any 
thought of disobeying the com- 
mand. The Parental’s home was 
his castle. The Rational had his 
Hard Caverns below and the Emo- 
tional her meeting places above. 
The Parental had only his home. 

Odeen therefore said, “Yes, 
Tritt. We’ll be out of your way.’’ 

And Dua extended a briefly lov- 
ing part of herself and said, “It’s 
good to see you, Right-dear.’’ 
(Odeen wondered if her gesture 
were relief over the fact that there 
was no pressure to melt. Tritt did 
tend to overdo that a bit — even 
more than Parentals generally.) 

In her chamber Dua stared at 
her private feeding place. Ordi- 
narily she ignored it. 

It had been Odeen’s idea. He 
knew that such things did exist and, 
as he explained to Tritt, if Dua did 
not like to swarm with the other 
Emotionals it was perfectly possible 



to lead Solar energy down into the 
cavern so that Dua might feed 
there. 

Tritt had been horrified. It 
wasn’t done. The others would 
laugh. The triad would be dis- 
graced. Why didn’t Dua behave as 
she should? 

“Yes, Tritt,’’ Odeen had said, 
“but she doesn’t behave as she 
should, so why not accommodate 
her? Is it so terrible? She will eat 
privately, gain substance, make us 
happier, become happier herself 
and maybe learn to swarm in the 
end.’’ 

Tritt allowed it and even Dua 
allowed it — after some argument 
—but insisted that it be a simple 
design. So the arrangement con- 
sisted of the two rods that served 
as electrodes powered by Solar 
energy, with room for Dua in be- 
tween. Bare essentials. 

Dua rarely used the accommoda- 
tion, but this time she stared at it 
and said, “Tritt has decorated it. 
Unless you did, Odeen.’’ 

“I? Of course not.” 

A pattern of colored clay de- 
signs was at the base of each 
electrode. “I suppose it’s his way 
of saying he wishes I would use it,” 
Dua said, “and I am hungry. Be- 
sides, if I’m eating, Tritt wouldn’t 
dream of interrupting us, would 
he?” 

“No,” said Odeen, gravely. 
“Tritt would stop the world if he 
thought its motion might disturb 
you while you were eating.” 

Dua said, “Well — I am hungry.” 

Odeen caught a trace of guilt 
in her. Guilt over Tritt? Over being 
hungry? Why should Dua feel 



48 



IF 




guilty about being hungry? Or had 
she done something that had con- 
sumed energy? 

He wrenched his mind away from 
that course impatiently. There were 
times when a Rational could be too 
Rational and chase down the track 
of every stray thought to the de- 
triment of what was important. 
Right now it was important for him 
to talk to Dua. 

S HE seated herself between 
electrodes and when she com- 
pressed herself to do so, her small 
size became only too painfully 
evident. Odeen was hungry him- 
self— he could tell because the 
electrodes seemed brighter than 
they ordinarily did and he could 
taste the food even at the distance 
and the savor was delicious. But 
he would eat later. 

Dua said, “Don’t just sit silent, 
Left-dear. Tell me. I want to know.’’ 
She had adopted (unconsciously?) 
the ovoid character of a Rational, 
as though to make it clearer that 
she wanted to be accepted as one. 

Odeen said, “I can’t explain it 
all— all the science, I mean— be- 
cause you haven’t had the back- 
ground. I will try to make it simple 
and you just listen. You tell me 
later what you don’t „ understand 
and I’ll try to explain further. You 
do know by now that everything is 
made up of tiny particles called 
atoms and that these are made up 
of still tinier subatomic particles.’’ 
“Yes, yes,’’ said Dua. “That’s 
why we can melt.’’ 

“Exactly. Because actually we 
are mostly empty space. All the 
particles are far apart and your 

THE GODS THEMSELVES 

i 



particles and mine and Tritt’s can 
all melt together because each set 
fits into the empty spaces around 
the other set. The reason matter 
doesn’t fly apart altogether is that 
the tiny particles do manage to 
cling together across the space 
that separates them. There are at- 
tractive forces holding them to-^ 
gether, the strongest being one we 
call the nuclear force. It holds the 
chief subatomic particles tightly 
together in bunches that are spread 
widely apart and that are held to- 
gether by weaker forces. Do you 
understand that?’’ 

“Only a little bit,” said Dua. 

“Well, never mind— we caa go 
back later. Matter can exist in 
different states. It can be especially 
spread out, as in Emotionals — as 
in you, Dua. It can be a little less 
spread out, as in Rationals and 
in Parentals. Or still less so, as in 
rock. It can be very compressed or 
thick, as in the Hard Ones. That’s 
why they’re hard. They are filled 
with particles.” 

“You mean there’s no empty 
space in them?” 

“No, that’s not quite what I 
mean,” said Odeen, puzzled as to 
how to make matter clearer. “They 
still have a great deal of empty 
space, but not as much as we do. 
Particles need a certain amount 
of empty space and if all they have 
is that much— just as much as they 
must have — then other particles 
can’t squeeze in. If particles are 
forced in pain occurs. That’s why 
the Hard Ones don’t like to be 
touched by us. We Soft Ones have 
more space between the particles 
than is actually needed, so other 

49 




particles can fit in without hurting.” 
Dua did not look at all con- 
vinced. 

Odeen hastened on. “In the other- 
Universe the rules are different. 
The nuclear force isn’t as strong as 
in ours. That means the particles 
need more room.” 

“Why?” 

Odeen shook his head. “Because 
—because— the particles spread 
out their wave forms more. I can’t 
explain better than that. With a 
weaker nuclear force, the particles 
need more room and two pieces of 
matter can’t melt together as 
easily as they can in our Universe.” 
“Can we see the other-Universe?” 
“Oh, no. That isn’t possible. We 
can deduce its nature from its 
basic laws. The Hard Ones can do 
a great many things, though. We 
can send material across and get 
material from the other-Universe 
creatures. We can study their 
material, you see. And we can set 
up the Positron Pump. You know 
about that, don’t you?” 

“Well, you’ve told me we get 
energy out of it. I didn’t know 
there was a different Universe in- 
volved. What is the other-Universe 
like? Does it have stars and 
worlds?” 

“That’s an excellent question, 
Dua.” Odeen was enjoying his role 
as teacher much more intensely 
than usual now that he had official 
encouragement to speak. (Earlier 
he had always felt a kind of sneak- 
ing perversion in trying to explain 
things to an Emotional.) 

H E SAID, “We can’t see the 
other-Universe, but we can 



calculate what it must be like from 
its laws. You see, what makes the 
stars shine is the gradual combina- 
tion of simple particle combina- 
tions into more complicated ones. 
We call it nuclear fusion.” 

“Do they have that in the other- 
Universe?” 

“Yes, but because the nuclear 
force is weaker, fusion is much 
slower. This means that the stars 
must be much, much bigger in the 
other-Universe— or not enough 
fusion would take place to make 
them shine. Stars of the other- 
Universe that were no bigger than 
our Sun would be cold and dead. 
On the other hand, if stars in our 
Universe were bigger than they 
are the amount of fusion would be 
so great it would blow them tip. 
That means that in our Universe 
there must be thousands of times 
as many small stars as there are 
large stars in theirs—” 

“We only have seven — ” began 
Dua. Then she added, “Oh, I forgot 
something — ” 

Odeen smiled indulgently. It was 
so easy to forget the uncounted 
stars that could not be seen except 
by special instruments. “That’s all 
right. You don’t mind my boring 
you with all this?” 

“You’re not boring me,” said 
Dua. “I love it. It even makes food 
taste good.” And she wavered 
between the electrodes with a kind 
of luxurious tremor. 

Odeen, who had never before 
heard Dua say anything compli- 
mentary about food, was greatly 
heartened. He said, “Of course, 
our Universe doesn’t last as long as 
theirs. Fusion goes so fast that all 



50 



IF 




the particles are combined after a 
million lifetimes.” 

“But there.are many other stars.” 
“Ah, but you see, they’re all 
going at once. The whole Universe 
is dying. In the other-Universe, 
with so many fewer and larger 
stars, the fusion goes so slowly that 
the stars last thousands and mil- 
lions of times as long as ours. It’s 
hard to compare because it may be 
that time moves at different rates 
in the two Universes.” He added 
with some reluctance. “I don’t 
understand that part myself. That’s 
part of the Estwald Theory and I 
haven’t got to that very much so 
far.” 

“Did Estwald work out all of 
this?” 

“A great deal of it.” 

Dua said, “It’s wonderful that 
we’re getting the food from the 
other-Universe. I mean, it doesn’t 
matter if our Sun dies out, then. 
We can get all the food we want 
from there.” 

“That’s right.” 

“But does nothing bad happen? 
I have the — the feeling that some- 
thing bad happens.” 

“Well,” said Odeen. “We trans- 
fer matter back and forth to work 
the Positron Pump and that means 
the two Universes mix together a 
little. Our nuclear force gets a tiny 
bit weaker, so fusion in our Sun 
slows up a little and. the Sun cools 
down a little faster. But just a little, 
and we don’t need it any more 
anyway.”^ 

“That’s not the something-bad 
feeling I have. If the nuclear force 
gets a tiny bit weaker the atoms 
take up more room— is that right? 

THE GODS THEMSELVES 



Then what happens to melting?” 

“That gets more difficult but 
it would take many millions of life- 
times before it would get difficult 
enough to notice. Even if some day 
melting became impossible and 
Soft Ones died oixt— that would 
happen long, long after we would 
all have died for lack of food if we 
weren’t using the other-Universe.” 

“That’s still not the something- 
bad— feeling — ” Dua's words were 
beginning to slur. She wriggled 
between her electrodes and to 
Odeen’s gratified eyes she seemed 
noticeably larger and compacted 
It was as though his words as well 
as the food were nourishing her. 

Losten was right. Education 
made her more nearly satisfied with 
life. Odeen could sense a kind of 
sensual joy in Dua that he had 
scarcely ever felt before. 

She said, “It is so kind of you to 
explain, Odeen. You are a good 
Left-ling.” 

“Do you want me to go on?” 
asked Odeen, flattered and more 
pleased than he could easily say. 
“Is there anything else you want to 
ask?” 

“A great deal, Odeen, but— but 
not now. Not now, Odeen. Oh, 
Odeen, do you know what I want 
to do?” 

Odeen guessed at once, but was 
too cautious to say it openly. Dua’s 
moments of erotic advance were 
too few to treat with anything but 
care. He hoped desperately that 
Tritt had not involved himself with 
the children to the point where they 
could not take advantage of this. 

But Tritt was already in the 
chamber. Had he been outside the 

51 




door, waiting? Odeen did not care. 
There was no time to think. 

Dua had flowed out from be- 
tween the electrodes and Odeen’ s 
senses were filled with her beauty. 
She was between them now and 
through her Tritt shimmered, his 
outlines flaming in incredible color. 

It had never been like this. Never. 

Odeen held himself back desper- 
ately, letting his own substance flow 
through Dua and into Tritt an 
atom at a time, holding away from 
the overpowering penetrance of 
Dua with ev^ry bit of strength, not 
giving himself up to the ecstasy, 
but letting it be wrenched from him 
— hanging on to his consciousness 
to the last possible moment and 
then blanking out in one final 
transport so intense it felt like an 
explosion echoing and reverbera- 
ting endlessly within him. 

Never in the lifetime of the triad 
had the period of melting uncon- 
sciousness lasted so long. 

3c 

T RITT was pleased. The melt- 
ing had been satisfactory. All 
previous occasions seemed skimpy 
and hollow in comparison. He was 
utterly delighted with what had 
happened. Yet he kept quiet. He 
felt it better not to speak. 

Odeen and Dua were happy, too. 
Tritt could tell. Even the children 
seemed to be glowing. 

But Tritt was happiest of all — - 
naturally. 

He listened to Odeen and Dua 
talk. That he understood none of it 
did not matter. He didn’t mind that 
they seemed so pleased with each 



other. He had his own pleasure and 
was content to listen. 

Dua said on one occasion. “And 
do they really try to communicate 
with us?’’ 

(Tritt never got it quite clear who 
“they’’ might be. He gathered that 
“communicate” was a fancy word 
for “talk.” So why didn’t they say 
“talk?” Sometimes he wondered if 
he should interrupt. But if he asked 
questions Odeen would only say, 
“Now, Tritt — ” and Dua would 
swirl impatiently.) 

“Oh, yes,” said Odeen. “The 
Hard Ones are quite sure of that. 
The other-beings have put mark- 
ings on the material that is sent us 
sometimes and the Hard Ones say 
that it is perfectly possible to 
communicate by such markings. 
Long ago, in fact, they used mark- 
ings, in reverse, when it was neces- 
sary to explain to the other-beings 
how to set up their part of the 
Positron Pump — in their Universe 
it is an Electron Pump.” 

“I wonder what the other-beings 
look like. What do you suppose?” 
“From the laws we can work out 
the nature of the stars because that 
is simple. But how can we work out 
the nature of the beings? We can 
never know.” 

“Couldn’t they communicate 
what they look like?” 

“If we understood what they 
communicated, perhaps we could 
make out something. But we don’t 
understand.” 

Dua seemed aggrieved. “Don’t 
the Hard Ones understand?” v 
“I don’t know. If they do they 
haven’t told me. Losten once said it 
didn’t matter what they were like as 



52 



IF 




long as the Pump worked and was 
enlarged.” 

“Maybe he just didn’t want you 
bothering him.” 

Odeen said huffily. “I don’t 
bother him.” 

“Oh, you know what I mean. He 
just didn’t want to get into those 
details.” 

By that time Tritt could no longer 
listen. They went on arguing for 
quite a while over whether the Hard 
Ones should let Dua look at the 
markings or not. Dua said that she 
might sense what they said, perhaps. 

Her remark made Tritt a little 
angry. After ail, Dua was only a 
Soft One and not even a Rational. 
He began to wonder if Odeen were 
right to tell her all he did. It gave 
Dua funny ideas. 

Dua could see Odeen was angry, 
too. First he laughed. Then he said 
that an Emotional could not handle 
such complicated ideas. Then he 
refused to talk at all. Dua had to be 
very pleasant to him till he came 
around. 



O N ONE occasion-it was Dua 
who was angry — absolutely 
furious. The moment began quietly. 
In fact, it was on one of the times 
when the two children were with 
them. Odeen was letting them play 
with him. He didn’t even mind 
when Little-right Torun pulled at 
him. In fact, he let himself go in 
most undignified fashion. He didn’t 
seem to mind that he was all out of 
shape. It was a sure sign he was 
pleased. Tritt remained in a corner, 
resting, he was so satisfied with 
what was happening. 



Dua laughed at Odeen’s mis- 
shapenness. She let her own sub- 
stance touch Odeen’s knobbishness 
flirtatiously. She knew very well 
that the leftish surface was sensitive 
when out of ovoid. 

Dua said, “I’ve been thinking, 
Odeen. If the other- Universe gets 
its laws into ours just a bit through 
the Pump, doesn’t our own Uni- 
verse get its laws into theirs the 
same little bit?” 

Odeen howled at Dua’s touch and 
tried to avoid her without upsetting 
the little ones. He gasped, “I can’t 
answer unless you stop, you Mid- 
ling wretch.” 

She stopped and he said, “That’s 
a good thought, Dua. You’re an 
amazing creature. It’s true, of 
course. The mixture goes both 
ways. Tritt, take out the little ones, 
will you?” 

But they scurried off by them- 
selves. They were not such little 
ones. They were quite grown. Annis 
would soon be starting his educa- 
tion and Torun was already quite 
Parentally blockish. 

Tritt stayed and thought Dua 
looked very beautiful when Odeen 
talked to her in this way. 

Dua said, “If the other laws slow 
down our Suns and cool them down 
—don’t our laws speed up theirs 
and heat them up?” 

“Exactly right, Dua. A Rational 
couldn’t do better.” 

“How hot do their Suns get?” 

“Just slightly hotter, very 
slightly.” 

Dua said, “But that’s where I 
keep getting the something-bad 
feeling.” 

“Oh, well, the trouble is that their 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



53 




Suns are so huge. If our little Suns 
get a littler cooler it doesn’t matter. 
Even if they turned off altogether 
it wouldn ? t matter as long as we 
have the Positron Pump. With 
great, huge stars, though— getting 
them even a little hotter is trouble- 
some. There so much material in 
one of those stars that turning up 
the nuclear fusion even a little way 
will make it explode.” 

“Explode? But then what hap- 
pens to the beings?” 

“What beings?” 

“The beings in the other- 
Universe.” 

For a moment Odeen looked 
blank. Then he said, “I don’t 
know.” 

“Well, what would happen if our 
own Sun exploded?” 

“It couldn’t explode.” 

(Tritt wondered what all the ex- 
citement was about. How could a 
Sun explode? Dua seemed angrier 
and Odeen looked confused.) 

Dua said, “But if it did? Would 
it get very hot?” 

“I suppose so.” 

“Wouldn’t it kill us all?” 

Odeen hesitated and then said in 
clear annoyance. “What difference 
does it make, Dua? Our Sun isn’t ex- 
ploding. Don’t ask silly questions.” 
“You told me to ask questions, 
Odeen, and it does make a differ- 
ence, because the Pump works both 
ways. We need their end as much as 
they need ours.” 

Odeen stared at her. “I never told 
you that.” 

“I feel it.” 

Odeen said, “You feel a great 
many things. Dua — ” 

But Dua was shouting now. She 



was quite beside herself. Tritt had 
never seen her like that. She Said, 
“Don’t change the subject, Odeen. 
And don’t withdraw and try to 
make me put a complete fool— just 
another Emotional. You said I was 
-almost like a Rational and I’m 
enough like one to see that our 
Positron Pump won’t work without 
the other-beings. If the beings in the 
Other-Universe are destroyed, their 
end of the Pump will stop and our 
Sun will be colder than ever and 
we’ll all starve. Don’t you think 
that’s important?” 

Odeen, too, was shouting now. 
“That shows what you know. We 
need their help because the energy 
supply is in low concentration and 
we have to switch matter. If the Sun 
in the other-Universe explodes 
there’ll be an enormous flood of 
energy — a huge flood that will last 
for a million lifetimes. There will be 
so much energy, we could tap it 
directly without any matter-shift 
either way — so we don’t need them. 
And it doesn’t matter what 
happens — ” 

They were almost touching now. 
Tritt was horrified. He had better 
say something, make them get 
apart, talk to them. He couldn’t 
think of anything to say. Then it 
turned out he didn’t have to. ' 
There was a Hard One just out- 
side the cavern. No, three of them. 
They had been trying to talk and 
hadn’t made themselves heard. 
Tritt shrieked, “Odeen! Dua!” 
Then he remained quiet, trem- 
bling. He had a frightened notion of 
what the Hard Ones had come to 
talk about. He decided to leave. 
But a Hard One put out one of 



54 



IF 




his permanent, opaque appendages 
and said, “Don’t go.” 

The words sounded harsh, un- 
friendly. Tritt was more frightened 
than ever. 

4a 

D U A was filled with anger, so 
filled she could scarcely sense 
the Hard Ones. She seemed stifled 
under the components of the anger, 
each one filling her to the brim, 
separately. She knew a sense of 
wrongness that Odeen should try to 
lie to her. Anothpr sense of wrong- 
ness that a whole world of beings 
should die. A third sense of wrong- 
ness that it was so easy for her to 
learn and that she had never been 
allowed to. 

✓ Since that time in the rock she 
had gone twice more to the Hard 
Caverns. Twice more, unnoticed, 
she had buried herself in rock, and 
each time she sensed and knew — so 
that when Odeen would explain 
matters to her she knew in advance 
what he would explain. 

Why couldn’t they teach her, 
then, as they had taught Odeen? 
Why only the Rationals? Did she 
possess the capacity to learn only 
because she was a Left- Em, a per- 
verted Mid-ling? Then let them 
teach her, perversion and all. It was 
wrong to leave her ignorant. 

Finally the words of the Hard 
One were breaking through to her. 
Losten was there, but he was not 
speaking. A strange Hard One 
spoke. She did not know him. 

The Hard One asked, “Which of 
you has been in the lower caverns 
recently — the Hard Caverns?’’ 

THE GODS THEMSELVES 



Dua was defiant. They had found 
her rock-rubbing and she didn’t 
care. Let them tell everybody. She 
would do so herself. 

She said, “I have. Many times.’’ 
“Alone?’’ asked the Hard One 
calmly. 

“Alone. Many times,” snapped 
Dua.; 

Odeen muttered, “I have, of 
course, been to the lower caverns 
on occasion.” 

The Hard One ignored Odeen. 
He turned to Tritt instead and 
asked sharply. “And you, Right?” 
Tritt quavered, “Yes, Hard-Sir.” 
“Alone?” 

“Yes, Hard-Sir.” 

“How often?” 

“Once.” 

Dua was annoyed. Poor Tritt was 
in such a panic over nothing. She 
was ready for a confrontation. 

“Leave him alone,” she said. 
“I’m the one you want.” 

The Hard One turned slowly 
toward her. “For what?” he asked. 

“For — whatever it is.” And 
faced with the prospect directly, she 
could not bring herself to describe 
what she had done after all. Not in 
front of Odeen. 

“Well, we’ll get to you. First, the 
Right. Your name is Tritt, isn’t it? 
Why did you go to the lower cav- 
erns alone?” 

“To speak to Hard One Estwald, 
Hard-sir.” 

Dua interrupted eagerly: “Are 
you Estwald?” 

The Hard One said briefly, “No.” 
Odeen looked annoyed, as though 
it embarrassed him that Dua did 
not recognize the Hard One. 

The • Hard One asked Tritt, 

55 




“What did you take from the lower 
caverns?” 

Tritt was. silent. 

The Hard One said without 
emotion. “We know you took 
something. We want to know if you 
know what it was. It could be very 
dangerous.” 

Tritt was still silent and Losten 
interposed, saying more kindly, 
“Please tell us, Tritt. We know now 
it was you and we don’t want to 
have to be harsh.” 

Tritt mumbled. “I took a 
food-ball.” 

“Ah.” It was the first Hard One 
speaking. “What did you do with 
it?” 

And Tritt burst out. “It was for 
Dua. She wouldn’t eat. It was for 
Dua.” 

Dua jumped and coalesced in 
astonishment. 

The Hard One turned on her at 
once. “You did not know about 
ii?” 

“No.” 

“Nor you?” To Odeen. 

Odeen, so motionless as to seem 
frozen, said, “No, Hard-Sir.” 

For a moment the air was full of 
unpleasant vibration as the Hard 
Ones spoke to each other, ignoring 
the triad. 

Whether her sessions at rock- 
rubbing had made her more sensi- 
tive or whether her recent storm of 
emotions had increased her aware- 
ness Dua could not tell, but she was 
catching hints — not of words — but 
of meanings. 

The Hard Ones had detected the 
loss some time ago. They had been 
searching quietly. They had turned 
to the Soft Ones as possible cul- 



prits with reluctance. They had 
investigated and finally focused on 
Odeen’s triad with even greater 
reluctance. (Why? Dua missed 
that.) They had not seen how Odeen 
could have had the foolishness to 
take the thing — or Dua the incli- 
nation. They had not thought of 
Tritt at all. 

Then the Hard One who had so 
far not said a word to the Soft Ones 
had recalled seeing Tritt in the 
Hard Caverns. (Of course, thought 
Dua— Tritt had been there on the 
day she had first entered the rock. 
She had sensed him then. She had 
forgotten.) 

All this Dua sensed and now she 
turned toward Tritt, feeling min- 
gled wonder and outrage. 

Losten was anxiously vibrating 
that no harm had been done, that 
Dua looked well, that what had 
happened was actually a useful 
experiment. The Hard One to 
whom Tritt had spoken was agree- 
ing — the other still exuded concern. 

Dua was looking at Tritt. 

The first Hard One said, “Where 
is the food-ball now, Tritt?” 

Tritt showed them. 

It was hidden effectively and the 
connections were clumsy but 
serviceable. 

The Hard One said, “Did you do 
this yourself, Tritt?” 

“Yes, Hard-Sir.” 

“How did you know the 
method?” 

“I looked at how it was done in 
the Hard Caverns. I did it exactly 
the way I saw it done there.” 

“Didn’t you know you might 
have harmed your Mid-ling?” 

“I didn’t— I wouldn’t— I—” 



56 



IF 




Tritt seemed unable to say more 
for a moment. Then he managed: 
“It was not to hurt her. It was to 
feed her. I let it pour into her feeder 
and I decorated her feeder. I wanted 
her to try it and she did. She ate! 
For the first time in a long while 
she ate well. We melted.” He 
paused, then said in a huge, tumul- 
tuous cry, “She had enough energy 
at last to initiate a baby-Emotional. 
She took Odeen’s seed and passed 
it to me. I have it growing inside 
me.” 

Dua could not speak. She with- 
drew and then rushed for the exit 
in so pell-mell a fashion that the 
Hard Ones could not get out of the 
way in time. She struck the appen- 
dage of the one in front, passing 
deep into it, then pulled free with a 
harsh sound. 

The Hard One’s appendage fell 
limp and he seemed contorted with 
pain. Odeen tried to dodge around 
him to follow Dua,- but the Hard 
One said with apparent difficulty, 
“Let her go for now. There is 
enough harm done. We will take 
care.” 

4b 

O DEEN found himself living 
through a nightmare. Dua was 
gone. The Hard Ones were gone. 
Only Tritt was still here — silent. 

How could it have happened? 
How could Tritt have found his way 
alone to the Hard Caverns? How 
could he have taken a storage cell 
charged at the Pump and designed 
to yield radiation in much more 
concentrated form than Sunlight 
and dared — 



Odeen would not have had the 
courage to chance it. How could 
Tritt, stumbling, ignorant Tritt 
have found it? Was he unusual, 
too? Odeen, the clever Rational — 
Dua, the curious Emotional — and 
Tritt, the daring Parental? 

He said, “How could you do it, 
Tritt?” 

Tritt retorted hotly, “What did I 
do? I fed her. I fed her better than 
she had^ever been fed before. Now 
we have a baby-Emotional initiated 
at last. Haven’t we waited long 
enough? We would have waited 
forever if we had waited for Dua.” 

“But don’t you understand, 
Tritt? You might have hurt her. It 
wasn’t ordinary Sunlight. It was an 
experimental radiation formula 
that could have been too concen- 
trated to be safe.” 

“I don’t understand what you’re 
saying, Odeen. How could it do 
harm? I tasted the kind of food the 
Hard Ones made before. It tasted 
bad. You’ve tasted it, too. It tasted 
just awful and it never hurt us. It 
tasted so bad, Dua wouldn’t touch 
it. Then I came on the food-ball. It 
tasted good. I ate some and it was 
delicious. How can anything de- 
licious hurt? Dua ate it. She liked 
it. And it started the baby-Emo- 
tional. How can I have done 
wrong?” 

Odeen despaired of explaining. 
He said, “Dua is going to be very 
angry.” 

“She’ll get over it.” 

“I wonder. Tritt, she’s not like 
ordinary Emotionals. That’s what 
makes her so hard to live with, but 
so wonderful when we can live with 
her. She may never want to melt 



THE GODS THEMSELVES

with us again. And then what?” 

Tritt’s outline was sturdily plane- 
surfaced. He asked, “Well, what of 
it?” 

“What of it? Do you want to give 
up melting?” 

“No, but if she won’t she won’t. 

I have my third baby and I don’t 
care any more. I know all about 
the Soft Ones in the old days. They 
used to have two triad-births some- 
times. But I don’t care. One is 
plenty.” 

“But, Tritt, babies aren’t all there 
is to melting.” 

“What else? I heard you say once 
you learned faster after you melted. 
Then learn slower. I don’t care. I 
have my third baby.” 

Odeen turned away trembling 
and flowed jerkily out of the cham- 
ber. What was the use of scolding 
Tritt? Tritt wouldn’t understand. 
He wasn’t sure he himself 
understood. 

Once the third baby was born 
and grown a little, the time would 
come to pass on. He, Odeen, would 
have to give the signal, would have 
to say when — and it would have to 
be done without fear. Anything 
else would be a disgrace — or worse 
— yet he would not be able to face 
the event without melting even 
when all three children had been 
formed. 

Melting would eliminate the 
fear — maybe because melting was 
like passing on. There was a period 
of time when you were not con- 
scious, yet it did not hurt. It was 
like not existing and yet it was 
desirable. With, enough melting he 
could gain the courage to pass on 
without fear and without. 



Oh, Sun and all the stars, it 
wasn’t “passing on.” Why use that 
phrase so solemnly? He knew the 
other word that was never used 
except by children who wanted to 
shock their elders. The word wa$ 
dying. He had to get ready to die 
without fear and to have Dua and 
Tritt die with him. 

And he did not know how. Not 
without melting. 

4c 

T RITT remained alone in the 
room, frightened, but sturdily 
resolved to remain unmoved. He 
had his third baby. He could feel 
it within him. 

That was what counted. 

That was all that counted. 

Why, then, deep inside, did he 
have a stubborn, faint feeling that 
it was not all that counted? 

5a 

■/ 

D UA was ashamed almost be- 
yond endurance. *It took a 
long time for her to battle down 
that shame — battle it down enough 
to give herself room to think. She 
had hastened — moving blindly — 
away from the horror of the home 
cavern, scarcely caring that she did 
not know where she was going or 
even where she was. 

It was night, a time when no 
decent Soft One would be on the 
surface, not even the most frivolous 
Emotional. It would be quite a 
while before the Sun rose. Dua was 
glad. The Sun was food and at the 
moment she hated food and what 
had been done to her. 



58 



IF 




It was cold, too, but Dua was 
only distantly aware of it. Why 
should she care about cold, she 
wondered, when she had been fat- 
tened in order that she might do her 
duty— fattened, mind and body? 
After that, cold and starvation had 
become her friends. 

She saw through Tritt. Poor 
thing— his actions were motivated 
by pure instinct and he was to be 
praised that he had followed 
through so bravely. He had come 
back so daringly from the Hard 
Caverns with the food-ball (and she 
had sensed him and would have 
known what was happening if Tritt 
had not been so paralyzed at what 
he was doing that he had not dared 
to think of it— and if she had nQt 
been so paralyzed at what she was 
doing that she had been unable to 
sense what she most needed to 
know.) 

Tritt had brought the food-ball 
back undetected and had arranged 
the pitiful booby-trap, decorating 
her feeder to entice her. And she 
had come back, flushed with aware- 
ness of her rock-probing thinness, 
filled with the shame of it and with 
pity for Tritt. With all that shame 
and pity she had eaten and had 
helped to intiate conception. 

Clever Odeen, she thought, must 
have seen through Tritt’s plan, 
must have spied the new connec- 
tions to the electrodes, must have 
understood Tritt’s purpose. Prob- 
ably he had said nothing to Tritt. 
To do so would have embarrassed 
and frightened the poor Right-ling 
and Odeen always watched over 
Tritt with loving care. 

Odeen had needed to say nothing. 

THE GODS THEMSELVES 



He needed only to fill in the gaps in 
Tritt’s clumsy plan to make it 
work. 

Dua was under no illusions now. 
She would have detected the taste 
of the food-ball, noticed its extra- 
ordinary tang, caught the rapidity 
with which it had begun to satisfy 
her while giving her no sensations 
of fullness— had it not been for 
Odeen’s occupying her with talk. 

It had been a conspiracy between 
the two of them, whether Tritt had 
been consciously part of it or not. 
How could she have believed that 
Odeen was suddenly a careful, 
painstaking teacher? How could 
she have failed to see the ulterior 
motive? Their concern for her was 
their concern for the completion 
of the new triad— and that in itself 
was an indication of how little they 
thought of her. 

S HE paused long enough to feel 
her own weariness and worked 
herself into a crevice in the rock 
that would shield her from the thin, 
cold wind. Two of the seven stars 
were in her field of vision and she 
watched them absently, occupying 
her outer senses with trivia so that 
she might concentrate the more in 
internal thought. 

“Betrayed,” she whispered to 
herself. “Betrayed!” 

Could Odeen and Tritt not see 
beyond themselves? 

That Tritt would be willing to 
see all destroyed if he were but 
secure in his babies was compre- 
hensible. He was a creature of 
instinct. But what of Odeen? 

Odeen reasoned. Did his talent 
mean that for the purpose of exer- 

59 




cising his reason he would sacrifice 
all else? Was its own excuse for 
being— at any cost— the sole prod- 
uct of reason? Because Estwald had 
devised that so-called Positron 
Pump, did it have to be used in 
order that the beings of a whole 
world, Hard and Soft alike, be 
placed at its mercy— and at that of 
the beings of the other-Universe? 
What if the other-beings stopped 
and the world was left without 
the Pump and with a dangerously 
cooled Sun? 

No, they wouldn’t stop, those 
other-beings. They had been per- 
suaded to start and they would be 
persuaded to keep going until they 
were destroyed — and then they 
would be needed no longer by the 
Rationals, Hard or Soft— just as 
she, Dua, would have to pass on (be 
destroyed) now that she was needed 
no longer. 

She and the other-beings were 
both being betrayed. 

Almost without being aware of 
doing so, she was cushioning deeper 
and deeper into the rock. She bur- 
ied herself out of sight of the stars, 
out of touch with the wind, un- 
aware of the world. She was pure 
thought. 

Estwald was the one she hated. 
He was the personification of all 
that was selfish and hard. He had 
devised the Pump and would de- 
stroy a whole world of perhaps tens 
of thousands without conscience. 
He was so withdrawn that he never 
made his appearance and so power- 
ful that even the other Hard Ones 
seemed afraid of him. 

Well, then, she would fight him. 
She would stop him. 



The beings of the other-Universe 
had assisted in setting up the Posi- 
tron Pump through communi- 
cations of some sort. Odeen had 
mentioned those. Where would 
such communications be kept? 
What would they be^ like? How 
could they be used for further 
communication? 

It was remarkable how clearly 
she could think. Remarkable. 
There was fierce enjoyment in 
this, that she would use reason to 
overcome the cruel reasoners. 

They would not be able to stop 
her for she could go where no Hard 
One could go, where no Rational 
or Parental could — and where no 
other Emotional would. 

She might be caught eventually, 
but at the moment she didn’t care. 
She was going to fight to have her 
way— at any price — though to do 
so meant she would have to go 
through rock, live in rock, skirt the 
Hard Caverns, steal food from their 
stored energy cells when she had to, 
flock with the other Emotionals 
and feed on Sunlight when she 
could. 

But in the end she would teach 
them all a lesson and after that 
they could do as they wished. She 
would even be ready to pass on 
then — but only then. 

5b 

O DEEN was present when the 
new baby-Emotional was 
born, perfect in every way, but he 
had not been able to feel enthusi- 
asm over it. Even Tritt, who cared 
for it perfectly, as a Parental must, 
seemed subdued in his ecstasies. 



60 



IF 




A long time had passed and it 
was as though Dua had vanished. 
She had not passed on.. A Soft One 
could not pass on except when the 
whole triad did — but she was not 
with the triad either. It was as 
though she had passed on without 
passing on. 

Odeen had seen her once, only 
once, not very long after her wild 
flight on the news that she had 
initiated the new baby. 

He had passed a cluster of Emo- 
tionals Sunning themselves when 
he had been moving over the sur- 
face with some foolish notion that 
he might find her. They had tit- 
tered at the rare sight of a Rational 
moving in the vicinity of an Emo- 
tional cluster and had thinned in 
mass provocation, with no thought 
among the foolish lot of them but 
to advertise the fact that they were 
Emotionals. 

Odeen felt only contempt for 
them and there was no answering 
stir along his own smooth curves 
at all. He thought of Dua instead 
and of how different she was from 
all of them. Dua never thinned for 
any reason other than her own 
inner needs. She had never tried to 
attract anyone and was the more 
attractive for that. If she could have 
brought herself to join the flock of 
empty-heads she would be easily 
recognized (he felt sure) by the fact 
that she alone would not thin — but 
would probably thicken precisely 
because the others thinned. 

As the thought struck him Odeen 
scanned the Sunning Emotionals 
and noted that one indeed had not 
thinned. 

He stopped, then hastened 
THE GODS THEMSELVES 



toward her, oblivious to the Emo- 
tionals in his way, disregarding 
their wild screeching as they flicked 
smokily out of his path and chat- 
tered desperately in their attempts 
to avoid coalescing one with the 
other right out in the open and 
with a Rational watching. 

It was Dua. She did not try to 
leave. She kept her ground and 
said nothing. 

“Dua,” he said humbly, “aren’t 
you coming home?” 

“I have no home, Odeen,” she 
said. Not angrily, not in hate— and 
all the more dreadfully for that 
reason. 

“How can you blame Tritt for 
what he did, Dua? You know the 
poor fellow can’t reason.” 

“But you can, Odeen, And you 
occupied my mind while he ar- 
ranged to feed my body, didn’t 
you? Your reason told you that I 
was much more likely to be trapped 
by you, than by him.” 

“Dua, no!” 

“No, what? Didn’t you make a 
big show of teaching me, of educa- 
ting me?” 

“I did, but it wasn’t a show — it 
was real. And it was not because 
of what Tritt had done. I didn’t 
know what Tritt had done.” 

“I can’t believe that.” She flowed 
away without haste. He followed 
her. They were alone now, the Sun 
shining redly down upon them. 

She turned to him. “Let me ask 
you one question, Odeen? Why 
did you want to teach me?” 

Odeen said, “Because I wanted 
to. Because I enjoy teaching and 
because I would rather teach than 
do anything else — but learn.” 

61 




“And melt, of course. Never 
mind,” she added to ward him off. 
“Don’t explain that you are talking 
of reason and not of instinct. If you 
really mean what you say about 
enjoying teaching— if I can really 
believe what you say — then per- 
haps you can understand something 
I’m going to tell you. I’ve been 
learning a great deal since I left 
you, Odeen. Never mind how. I 
have. There’s no Emotional left in 
me at all, except physiologically. 
Inside, where it counts, I’m all 
Rational, except that I hope I have 
more feeling for others than Ra- 
tional have. And one thing I’ve 
learned is what ' we really are, 
Odeen— you and I and Tritt and 
all the other triads on this planet— 
what we really are and always 

“What is that?” asked Odeen. 

H E WAS prepared to listen for 
as long as might be necessary 
—and as quietly — if only she would 
come back with him when she had 
said her say. He would perform any 
penance, do anything that might be 
required. Only she must come back 
—and something dim and dark 
inside him knew that she had to 
come back voluntarily. 

“What we are? Why, nothing, 
really, Odeen,” she said lightly, 
almost laughing. “Isn’t that 
strange? The Hard Ones are the 
only living species on the face of the 
world. Haven’t they taught you 
that? There is only one species be- 
cause you and I, the Soft Ones, are 
not really alive. We’re machines, 
Odeen. We must be because only 
the Hard Ones are alive. Haven’t 



they taught you that, Odeen?” 

“But, Dua, that’s nonsense,” 
said Odeen, nonplused. 

Dua’s voice grew harsher. “Ma- 
chines, Odeen! Made by the Hard 
Ones! Destroyed by the Hard Ones! 
They are alive, the Hard Ones. 
Only they. They don’t talk about 
it much. They don’t have to. They 
all know it. But I’ve learned to 
think, Odeen, and I’ve worked it 
out from the small clues I’ve found. 
They live tremendously long lives, 
but die eventually. They no longer 
give birth— the Sun yields too little 
energy for that. And since they die 
very infrequently, but don’t give 
birth at all, their numbers are very 
slowly declining. And there are no 
young ones to provide new blood 
and new thoughts so the old, long- 
lived Hard Ones get terribly bored. 
So what do you suppose they do, 
Odeen?” 

“What?” There, was a kind of 
fascination about this. A repulsive 
fascination. 

“They manufacture mechanical 
children whom they can teach. You 
said it yourself, Odeen. You would 
rather teach than do anything else 
but learn. And melt, of course. The 
Rationals are made in the mental 
image of the Hard Ones. The Hard 
Ones don’t melt and learning is 
terribly complex for them since 
they already know so much. What 
is left for them but the fun of 
teaching? Rationals were created 
for no purpose but to be taught. 
Emotionals and Parentals were 
created because they were neces- 
sary for the self-perpetuating 
machinery that made new Ration- 
als. And new Rationals were needed 



62 



IF 




constantly because the old ones 
were used up, were taught all they 
could be taught. And when old 
Rationals had absorbed what they 
could they were destroyed and were 
taught, in advance, to call the de- 
struction process “passing on” to 
spare their feelings. And of course, 
Emotronals and Parentals passed 
on with them. As long as they had 
helped form a new triad there was 
no further use for them.” 

“But that’s all wrong, Dua,’’ 
Odeen managed to say. He had no 
arguments to pose against her 
nightmare scheme, but he knew 
with a certainty past argument 
that she was wrong. (Or did a little 
pang of doubt deep inside him sug- 
gest that the certainty might have 
been implanted in him to begin 
with? No, surely no— for then, 
would not Dua be implanted with a 
certainty, too, that this was wrong? 
Or was she an imperfect Emotional 
without the proper implantations 
and without— Oh, what was he 
thinking? He was as crazy as she.) 

Dua said, “You look upset, 
Odeen. Are you sure I’m all wrong? 
Of course, now the Hard Ones have 
the Pump and all the energy they 
need. Soon they will be giving birth 
again. Maybe they are doing so 
already. And they won’t need any 
Soft-One machines at all and we 
will all be destroyed — I beg pardon, 
we will all pass on.’’ 

“No, Dua,’’ said Odeen strenu- 
ously as much to himself as to her. 
“I don’t know how you got those 
notions, but the Hard Ones aren’t 
like that. We are not destroyed.’’ 
“Don’t lie to yourself, Odeen. 
They are like that. They are pre- 



pared to destroy a whole world of 
other-beings for their benefit, a 
whole Universe if they have to. 
Would they stop at destroying a few 
Soft Ones for their comfort? But 
they made one mistake. Somehow 
the machinery went wrong and a 
Rational mind got into an Emo- 
tional body. I’m a Left-Em, do you 
know that? They called me that 
when I was a child and they were 
right. I can reason like a Rational 
and I can feel like an Emotional. 
And I will fight the Hard Ones with 
that combination.’’ 

Odeen felt wild. Dua must surely 
be mad, yet he dared not say so. 
He had to cajole her somehow and 
bring her back. He said with sin- 
cerity, “Dua, we’re not destroyed 
when we pass on.’’ 

“No? What does happen then?’’ 
“I— I don’t know. I think we 
enter another world, a better and 
happier world and become like — 
like— well, much better than we 
are.’’ 

Dua laughed. “Where did you 
hear that? Did the Hard Ones tell 
you that?’’ 

“No, Dua. I’m sure that this 
must be so out of my own thoughts. 
I’ve been thinking a great deal 
since you left.’’ 

Dua said, “Then think less and 
you’ll be less foolish. Poor Odeen! 
Goodbye.’’ She flowed away once 
more, thinly. There was an air of 
weariness about her. 

Odeen called out, “But wait, 
Dua. Surely you want to see your 
new baby-mid.’’ 

She did not answer. 

He cried out, “When will you 
come home?’’ 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



63 




She did not answer. 

And he followed no more, but 
looked after her in deepest misery 
as she dwindled. 



H E DID not tell Tritt he had 
seen Dua. What was the use? 
Nor did he see her again. He began 
haunting the favored Sunning sites 
of the Emotionals of the region, 
doing so even though occasional 
Parentals emerged to watch him in 
stupid suspicion (Tritt was a mental 
giant compared to most Parentals). 

The lack of her hurt more with 
each passing day. And with each 
passing day he realized that there 
was a gathering fright inside him- 
self over her absence. He didn’t 
know why. 

He came back to the home cav- 
ern one day to find Losten waiting 
for him. Losten was standing, grave 
and polite, while Tritt was showing 
him the new baby and striving to 
keep the handful of mist from 
touching the Hard One. 

Losten said, “It is indeed a 
beauty, Tritt. Derala is its name?” 
“Derola,” Tritt corrected. “I 
don’t know when Odeen will be 
back. He wanders about a lot.” 
“Here I am, Losten,” said Odeen 
hastily. “Tritt, take the baby away, 
there’s a good fellow.” 

Tritt did so and Losten turned to 
Odeen with quite obvious relief, 
saying, “You must be very happy 
to have completed the triad.” 
Odeen tried to answer with some 
polite inconsequence, but could 
maintain only a miserable silence. 
He had recently been developing a 
kind of comradeship, a vague sense 



of equality with the Hard Ones 
that enabled them to talk together 
on a leyel. Somehow Dua’s mad- 
ness had spoiled it. Odeen knew 
she was wrong and yet he ap- 
proached Losten once more as 
stiffly as in the long-gone days 
when he had thought of himself as 
a creature far inferior to them— 
as a machine? 

Losten asked, “Have you seen 
Dua?” The question was real, not 
mere politeness, Odeen could tell. 

“Only once, H — ” (He almost 
said “Hard-Sir” as though he were 
a child again or a Parental). “Only 
once, Losten. She won’t come 
home.” 

“She must come home,” said 
Losten softly.” 

“1 don’t know how to arrange 
that.” 

Losten regarded him somberly. 
“Do you know what she is doing?” 

Odeen did not dare to look at the 
Hard One. Had Losten discovered 
Dua’s wild theories? What would 
be done about that? 

He made a negative sign without 
speaking. 

Losten said, “She is a most un- 
usual Emotional, Odeen. We have 
spoken of that.” 

- “Yes.” Odeen sighed. 

“As unusual as you are in your 
way and Tritt in his. I doubt that 
any other Parental in the world 
would have had either the courage 
or the initiative to steal an energy 
storage cell or the perverse ingenu- 
ity to put it to use as he did. The 
three of you make up the most 
unique triad of which we have any 
record.” 

“Thank you.” 



64 



IF 




“But there - are uncomfortable 
aspects to the triad, too, things we 
didn’t count on. We wanted you to 
teach her by way of cajoling her 
into performing her function in 
the triad. We did not count on 
Tritt’s quixotic action at just that 
moment. Nor, to tell you the truth, 
did we count on her wild reaction 
to the fact that the world in the 
other-Universe must be destroyed.” 
“I ought to have been careful 
how I answered her questions,” 
said Odeen miserably. 

“Caution would not have helped. 
She was finding out for herself. We 
didn’t count on that either. Odeen, 

I am sorry, but I must tell you 
this— Dua has become a deadly 
danger. She is trying to stop the 
Positron Pump.” 

“But how can she? She can’t 
reach it — and even if she could she 
lacks the knowledge to do, anything 
about it.” 

“Oh, but she can reach it.” Los- 
ten hesitated, then said, “She re- 
mains infused in; the rock of the 
world where she is safe from us.” 

It took a while for Odeen to grasp 
the clear meaning of the words. He 
said, “No grown Emotional would 
—Dua would never—” 

“She would. She does. Don’t 
waste time arguing the point. She 
can penetrate anywhere in the cav- 
erns. Nothing is hidden from her. 
She has studied those communica- 
tions we have received from the 
other-Universe. There is no other 
way of explaining what is 
happening.” 

“Oh, oh, oh.” Odeen rocked back 
and forth, his surface opaque with 
shame and grief. “Does Estwald 

THE GODS THEMSELVES 



know anything of all this?” 

Losten said, grimly, “Not yet, 
though he must know some day.” 
“But what will she do with those 
communications?” 

“She is ifsing them to work out a 
method for sending some of her 
own in the other direction.” 

»“But she cannot know how to 
translate or transmit.” 

“She is learning both. She knows 
more about those communications 
than Estwald himself. She is a 
frightening phenomenon, an Emo- 
tional who can reason and who is 
out of control.” 

Odeen shivered. Out of control? 
How machinelike a reference? 

He said, “It can’t be that bad.” v 
“It can. She has communicated 
already and I fear she is advising 
the other-Universe creatures to 
stop their half of the Pump. If they 
do so before their Sun explodes we 
will be helpless at this end.” 

“But then — ” 

“She must be stopped, Odeen.” 
“But, how? Are you going to 
blast—” His voice failed. Dimly 
he knew that the Hard One had 
devices for digging caverns out of 
the world’s rock, devices scarcely 
used since the world’s population 
had begun declining ages ago. 
Would they locate Dua in the rock 
and blast it and her? 

“No,” said Losten forcefully. 
“We cannot harm Dua.” 

“Estwald might—” 

“Estwald cannot harm her 
either.” 

“Then what’s to be done?” 

“It’s you, Odeen. Only you. 
We’re helpless, so we must depend 
oh you.”

“On me? But what can I do?” 
“Think about it,” said Losten 
urgently. “Think about it.” 

“Think about what?” 

“I can’t say more than that,” 
said Losten in apparent agony. 
“Think! There is so little time.” 

He turned and left, moving rap- 
idly for a Hard One, moving as 
though he did not trust himself to 
stay and perhaps say too much. 

And Odeen could only look after 
him, dismayed, confused— lost. 

5c 

T HERE was a great deal for 
Tritt to do. Babies required 
much care, but two you.ng lefts and 
two young rights together did not 
make up the sum of a single baby- 
mid — particularly not a mid as 
perfect as Derola. She had to be 
exercised and soothed, protected 
from percolating into whatever 
she touched, cajoled into condens- 
ing and resting. 

It was a long time before he saw 
Odeen again and actually he didn't 
care. Derola took up all his time. 
But' then he came across Odeen in 
the corner of his own alcove, iri- 
descent with thought. 

Tritt remembered suddenly. He 
asked, “Was Losten angry about 
Dua?“ 

Odeen came to himself with a 
start* “Losten? Yes, he was angry. 
Dua is doing great harm.” 

“She should come home, 
-shouldn’t she?’’ 

Odeen was staring at Tritt. He 
said, “We’re going to have to per- 
suade Dua to come home. We must 
find her first. You can do it. With 



a new baby your Parental sensitiv- 
ity is very high. You can use it to 
find Dua.’’ 

“No,’’ said Tritt, shocked. “It’s 
used for Derola. It would be wrong 
to use it for Dua. Besides, if she 
wants to stay away so long when 
a baby-mid is longing for her — and 
she once a baby-mid herself — 
maybe we might just learn to do 
without her.’’ 

“But, Tritt, don’t you ever want 
to melt again?’’ 

“Well, the triad is now complete.’’ 

“That’s not all there is to 
melting.’’ 

Tritt said, “But, where do we have 
to go to find her? Little Derola 
needs me. She’s a tiny baby. I 
don’t want to leave her.’’ 

“The Hard Ones will arrange to 
have Derola taken care of. You and 
I will go to the Hard Caverns and 
find Dua.*’ 

Tritt thought about that. He 
didn’t care about Dua. He didn’t 
even care about Odeen, somehow. 
Only Derola mattered. He said, 
“Some day when Derola is older. 
Not till then.” 

“Tritt,” Odeen pressed urgently, 
“we must find Dua. Otherwise — 
otherwise the babies will be taken 
away from us.” 

“By whom?’’ 

“By the Hard Ones.’’ 

Tritt was silent. He could find 
nothing to say. He had never heard 
of such a thing. He douid not con- 
ceive of such a thing. 

Odeen said, “Tritt, we must pass 
on. I know why at last. I’ve been 
thinking about it ever since Losten 
—but never mind that. Dua and 
you must pass on, too. Now that I 



66 



IF 




know why, you will feel you must 
and I hope — I think — Dua will feel 
she must, too. And we must pass on 
soon, for Dua is destroying the 
world.” 

Tritt was backing away. “Don’t 
look at me like that, Odeen. You’re 
forcing me. You’re making me—” 
“I’m not forcing you, Tritt,” 
said Odeen sadly. “It’s just that I 
know now and so you must. But 
we must find Dua.” 

“No, no.” Tritt was in agony, 
trying to resist. There was some- 
thing terribly new about Odeen and 
existence was approaching an end 
inexorably. There would be no 
Tritt and no baby-mid. Where 
every other Parental had his baby- 
mid for a long time, Tritt would 
have lost his almost at once. 

It wasn’t fair. Oh, it wasn’t fair. 
Tritt panted. “It’s Dua’s fault. 
Let her pass on first.” 

Odeen said, with deadening 
calm. “There’s no other way but for 
all of us—” 

And Tritt knew that was so — 
that was so — that was so — 

6a 

D UA felt thin and cold. Her 
attempts to rest in the open 
and absorb Sunlight had ended 
after Odeen had found her that 
time. Her feeding at the Hard 
Ones’ energy cells was erratic. She 
dared not remain too long outside 
the safety of rock, so she ate 
quickly and never got enough. 

She was continuously conscious 
of hunger. To remain in the rock 
seemed to tire her. It was as though 
she were being punished for all 



that long time when she had 
haunted tne Sunset and eaten so 
skimpily. 

If it were not for the work she 
was doing she could not have borne 
the weariness and hunger. Some- 
times she hoped that the Hard Ones 
would destroy her — but only after 
she had finished. 

The Hard Ones were helpless as 
long as she was in the rock. Some- 
times she sensed them in the open 
outside the rock. They were afraid. 
Sometimes she thought their fear 
was for her, but that couldn’t be. 
How could they be afraid for her? 
Were they afraid that she would 
pass on out of sheer lack of food, 
out of sheer exhaustion? It had to 
be that they were afraid of her— 
afraid of a machine that did not 
work as they had designed it to 
work, appalled at so great a prod- 
igy, struck helpless with terror of 
it. 

She avoided them carefully. She 
always knew where they were, so 
they could not catch her or stop 
her. 

They could not watch all places 
always. She thought she couid even 
blank what little perception they 
had. 

She swirled out of the rock and 
studied the recorded duplicates of 
the communications they had re- 
ceived from the other-Universe. 
Jhey did not know what she was 
after. If they hid them, she would 
find them in whatever new place. 
If they destroyed them, it didn’t 
matter. Dua could remember them. 

She did not understand them at 
first, but her senses grew steadily 
sharper — more and more she 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



67 




seemed to understand without 
understanding. Without knowing 
what the symbols meant, they in- 
spired feelings within her. 

She picked out markings and 
placed them where they would be 
sent to the other- Universe. The 
markings were F-E-E-R. What that 
could possibly mean she had no 
idea, but its shape inspired her with 
a feeling of fear and she did her best 
to impress that feeling upon the 
markings. Perhaps the other- 
creatures, studying the markings, 
would also feel fear. 

When the answers came Dua 
could sense excitement in them. 
She did not always get the answers 
that were sent. Sometimes the 
Hard Ones found them first. 
Surely, they must be finding out 
what she was doing. Still, they 
could not read the messages, could 
not even sense the emotions that 
went along with them. 

Sq she didn’t care. She would not 
be stopped before she finished, no 
matter what the Hard Ones found 
out. 

She waited for a message that 
would carry the feeling she wanted 
It came: P-U-M-P B-A-D. 

It carried the fear and hatred she 
wanted. She sent it back in ex- 
tended form— more fear — more 
hatred. Now the other-beings 
would understand. Now they would 
stop the Pump. The Hard Ones 
would have to find some other 
way, some other source of energy 
— they must not obtain it through 
the death of all those thousands 
of other- Universe creatures. 

She was resting too much, de- 
clining into a kind of stupor within 



the rock. She craved food desper- 
ately and waited for a chance to 
crawl out. Even more desperately 
than she wanted the food in a stor- 
age cell she wanted that storage 
cell to be dead. She wanted to suck 
the last bit of energy out of it and 
know that no more would come and 
that her task was done. 

She emerged at last and remained 
recklessly long, sucking in the con- 
tents of one of the cells. She wanted 
to empty it, see that no more was 
entering— but it was an endless 
source — endless — endless. 

She stirred and drew away in 
disgust. The Pump action in the 
Other-Universe was still going, 
then. Had her messages not per- 
suaded the other-beings to stop the 
Pump? Had they not received her 
signals? Had they not sensed their 
meaning? 

She had to try again. She had to 
make matters plain beyond plain. 
She would include every combina- 
tion of symbols that to her seemed 
to carry the feeling of danger; every 
combination that would put across 
the plea to stop. 

Desperately she began to fuse the 
symbols into metal; drawing with- 
out reserve on the energy she had 
just absorbed — drawing on it till it 
was all gone and she was more 
weary than ever: PUMP NQT 
STOP NOT STOP WE NOT 
STOP PUMP WE NOT HEAR 
DANGER NOT HEAR NOT 
HEAR YOU STOP PLEASE 
STOP YOU STOP SO WE STOP 
PLEASE YOU STOP DANGER 
DANGER DANGER DANGER 
STOP STOP YOU STOP PUMP. 

It was all she could do. There was 



68 



IF 




nothing left in her but a racking 
pain. She placed the message 
where it could be transferred and 
she did not wait for Hard Ones to 
send the message unwittingly. 
Through an agonizing haze she 
manipulated the controls as she 
had seen them do, finding the 
energy for it somehow. 

The message disappeared and so 
did the cavern in a purple shimmer 
of vertigo. She was— passing on- 
out of sheer— exhaustion. 

Odeen— Tri— 



6bc 

O DEEN came. He had been 
flowing faster than he had 
ever flowed before. He had been 
following Tritt’s new-baby sharp- 
ened sense perception, but pow he 
was close enough for his own 
blunter senses to detect her near- 
ness. He could on his own account 
feel the flickering and fading 
consciousness of Dua and he raced 
forward while Tritt did his best to 
clump along, gasping and calling, 
“Faster— faster— ” 

Odeen found her in a State of 
collapse, scarcely alive, smaller 
than he had ever seen an adult 
Emotional. 

“Tritt,” he said, “Bring the food- 
ball here. Np, don’t try to carry her. 
She’s too thin to carry. Hurry. If 
she sinks into the floor — ” 

The Hard Ones began to gather. 
They were late, of course, with 
their inability to sense other life 
forms at a distance. If saving Dua 
had depended only on them she 
would have perished. She would 



not have passed on — she would 
truly have been destroyed and more 
than she knew would have been 
destroyed with her. 

Now, as she was slowly gathering 
life, the Hard Ones stood silently 
near them. 

Odeen rose, a new Odeen who 
knew exactly what was happening. 
Imperiously he ordered them away 
with an angry gesture— and they 
left. Silently. Without objection. 

Dua stirred. 

Tritt said, “Is she all right, 
Odeen?” 

“Quiet, Tritt,” said Odeen. 
“Dua?” 

“Odeen?” She stirred, spoke in 
a whisper. “I thought I had passed 
on.” 

“Not yet, Dua. Not yet. But first 
you must eat and rest.” 

“Is Tritt here, too?” 

“Here I am, Dua,” said Tritt. 

“Don’t try to bring me back,” 
said Dua. “It’s over. I’ve done 
what I wanted to do. All Pump 
action in the other- Universe will 
stop soon, I’m sure — making use- 
less our end of the Pump. The 
Hard Ones will continue to need 
Soft Ones and they will take care 
of you two— or at least the 
children.” 

Odeen said nothing. He kept 
Tritt, too, from speaking. He let 
the radiation pour slowly into Dua. 
He stopped at times to let her rest 
a bit, then started again. 

She began to mutter, “Enough. 
Enough.” Her substance was 
writhing more strongly. 

Still he fed her. 

Finally lie spoke. “Dua, you were 
wrong. We are not machines. I 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



69 




know exactly what we are. I would 
have come to you sooner if I had 
found out earlier, but I didn’t know 
till Losten begged me to think. And 
I did— very hard.” 

Dua moaned and Odeen stopped 
for a while. 

He said, “Listen, Dua. There is 
a single species of life. The Hard 
Ones are the only living things in 
the world. You gathered that, and 
so far you were right. But that 
doesn’t mean the Soft Ones aren’t 
alive — it merely means they are 
part of the same single species. 
The Soft Ones are the immature 
forms of the Hard Ones. We are 
first children as Soft Ones, then 
adults as Soft Ones, then Hard 
Ones. Do you understand?’’ 

Tritt muttered in soft confusion, 
“What? What?’’ 

Odeen said, “Not now, Tritt. 
Not now. You’ll understand, too, 
but this is for Dua.’’ He kept watch- 
ing Dua, who was gaining 
opalescence. 

He said, “Listen, Dua, whenever 
we melt, whenever the triad melts, 
we become a Hard One. The Hard 
One is three-in-one, which is why 
he is hard. During the time of un- 
consciousness in melting we are a 
Hard One. But it is only temporary 
and we can never remember the 
period afterward. We can never 
stay a Hard One long — we must 
come back. But all through our life 
we keep developing, with certain 
key stages marking off our growth. 
Each baby born marks a key stage. 
With the birth of the third, the 
Emotional, there comes the pos- 
sibility of the final stage, where the 
Rational’s mind by itself, without 



the other two, can remember those 
flashes of Hard One existence. 
Then, "and only then, can he guide 
a perfect melt that will form the 
Hard One forever, so that the triad 
can live a new and unified life of 
learning and intellect. 1 told you 
that passing on was like being born 
again. I was groping then for some- 
thing I did not quite understand— 
but now I know.’’ 

Dua was looking at him, trying to 
smile. She asked, “How can you 
pretend to believe that,- Odeen? If 
that were so, wouldn’t the Hard 
Ones have told you long ago— told 
all of us?” 

“They couldn’t, Dua. There was 
a time, long ages ago, when melting 
was just a putting together of the 
atoms of bodies. But evolution 
slowly developed minds. Listen to 
me, Dua. Melting is a putting to- 
gether of the minds, too, and that’s 
a much harder, a much more deli- 
cate process. To put them together 
properly and permanently, just so, 
the Rational must reach a certain 
pitch in development. That pitch is 
reached when he finds out for him- 
self what it’s all about— when his 
mind is finally keen enough to 
remember what has happened in 
all those temporary unions during 
melting. If the Rational were told, 
that development would be aborted 
and the time of the perfect melt 
could not be determined. The Hard 
One would form imperfectly. When 
Losten pleaded with me to think he 
was taking a great chance. Even 
that may have been — I hope not 
what I’m thinking. For its espe- 
cially true in our case, Dua. For 
many generations, the Hard Ones

IF 




have be^n combining triads with 
great care to form particularly ad- 
vanced Hard Ones and our triad 
was the best they’d ever obtained. 
Especially you, Dua. Especially 
you. Losten was once the Rational 
of the triad whose baby-mid you 
were. He knew you. He brought 
you to Tritt and me.” 

Dua sat up. Her voice was almost 
normal. “Odeen— are you making 
all this up to soothe me?” 

Tritt broke in. “No, Dua. I feel 
it, too. I feel it, too. I don’t know 
what exactly — but I feel it.” 

“He does, Dua,” said Odeen. 
“You will, too. Aren’t you begin- 
ning to recall being a Hard One 
during our melt? Don’t you want to 
melt now? One last time?” ' 

He lifted her. There was a fever- 
ishness about her and, though she 
struggled a bit, she was thinning. 

“If what you say is true, Odeen,” 
she gasped. “If we are to be a Hard 
One— then it seems to me you are 
saying we’ll be an important one. 
Is that so?” 

“The most important. The best 
who was ever formed. I mean that. 
Tritt; it’s not goodbye. We’ll be 
together as we always wanted to 
be. Dua, too. You, too, Dua.” 

Dua said. “Then we can make 
Estwald understand the Pump can’t 
continue. We’ll force — ” 

The melting was beginning. One 
by one the Hard Ones were enter- 
ing again at the crucial moment. 
Odeen saw them imperfectly, for 
he was beginning to melt into Dua. 

It was not like the other times. 
He was aware of no sharp ecstasy 
—just a smooth, cool, utterly 
peaceful movement. He could feel 



himself become partly Dua and all 
the world seemed pouring into his/ 
her sharpening senses. The Posi- 
tron Pumps were still going — he/ 
she could tell— why were they still 
going? 

He was Tritt, too, and a keen 
sense of bitter loss filled his/her/ 
his mind. 

Oh, my babies . 

He cried out, uttered one last cry 
under the consciousness of Odeen, 
except that somehow it was the cry 
of Dua. “No, we can’t stop Est- 
wald. We are Estwald. We — ” 

The cry that was Dua’s and yet 
not Dua’s stopped and there was no 
longer any Dua — nor would there 
ever be Dua again. Or Odeen. Or 
Tritt. 

7abc 

Estwald stepped forth and said 
sadly to the waiting Hard Ones 
by way of vibrating airwaves, “I 
am permanently with you now and 
there is much to do—” •

HARRY HARRISON 

The Rat would be home safe — 
if yesterday he had not died! 



I 

H AVE you ever been trapped 
in St. Paul’s Cathedral in the 
year 1807 a.d., alone and welded 
to a steel post and soon to vanish 
with the world outside — which had 
already become nonexistent? Not 
many people can answer yes to 
that question — but I can. I can’t 



really say that I enjoy the distinc- 
tion. I must further admit that 1 
had never been happier to see my 
wife. 

“Angelina, truly named,” I said 
as, light as a falling leaf, she drifted 
down to the floor. “You descend 
from above to save me.” 

She opened the faceplate of her 
spacesuit wider so she could kiss me 




through the opening, then took an 
atomic lance from her belt and 
began to cut away my chains. 
“Now tell me what all this time- 
travel nonsense is about. And talk 
fast. We have only seven minutes — 
at least that is what Coypu said.” 
“What else did he tell you?” 1 
asked, wondering just how much 
she knew. 



“Stop being mysterious with me, 
Slippery Jim diGriz! I’ve had 
enough of that with Coypu.” 

1 jumped back hastily as she 
waved the atomic lance under my 
chin. Then I beat out the fire she 
had started on my garments. An 
angry Angelina can be quite dan- 
gerous. 

“My love,” I said emotionally, 



attempting to embrace her While 
keeping an eye on the lance at the 
same time. “I conceal nothing from 
you — nothing! I know better. It is 
just that my brain is tied in knots 
and I want to know where your 
knowledge leaves off before I 
continue with the complete story.” 

“You know perfectly well that I 
talked to you last on the phone. Big 
rush, you said, top priority, get 
over fast you shouted— then rang 
off. So I rushed to Copyu’s lab. 
Everyone was running around 
playing with the machinery and too 
busy to tell me anything. Back in 
time, they shouted when I asked 
where you were. Nothing else. And 
that horrid Inskipp was no better. 
He said you vanished— just 
vanished out of his office— while he 
was reading the riot act to you. 
Apparently he found out about 
that little bit of money you are 
putting aside for a rainy decade or 
two. There was a lot of babble 
about your saving the world or the 
galaxy or something— I couldn’t 
understand a word of it. And all of 
this went on for a very long time — 
until they could send me back 
here.” 

“Well, I did save the world” I 
said modestly. “Saved you, saved 
the Corps, saved the whole thing.” 

“I was right. You have been 
drinking.” 

“Not in entirely too long a time,” 
I muttered petulantly. “If you want 
to know the truth you all vanished, 
poof \ just like that. Coypu was the 



last one to go so he can tell you 
about it. The Corps, everyone, they 
were never born, never existed 
except in my memory — ” 

“My memory is slightly 
different.” 

“It would be. Since through my 
efforts He’s evil plan was foiled—” 
“His not he's. All that drinking 
has affected your speech.” 

“ He is his name — and I haven’t 
had a drop in hours! Can you 
possibly listen without interrupting? 
This story is complicated enough in 
any case — ” 

“Complicated and possibly 
alcoholically inspired.” 

I GROANED. Then I kissed her, 
at length and more warmly 
this time, a distraction we both 
enjoyed. This softened her a bit so 
I rushed on before she remembered 
that she was supposed to be angry 
at me. 

“A time attack was launched 
against the Special Corps, and 
Professor Coypu whisked me back 
in time to foil the nefarious scheme. 
I did all right in nineteen seventy- 
five but He got away, went back to 
whenever he came from, then set 
up an elaborate trap here in 
eighteen hundred and seven to trap 
me. Which he did. But his plans 
didn’t work completely because I 
managed to change the setting on 
the time helix so he was sent to a 
different time from where he had 
intended to go. This must have 
defeated his plans — since you 



74 



IF 




managed to get here to rescue me/' 
“Oh, darling, how wonderful of 
you. I knew you could save the 
world if you really tried.” 
Mercurial, I guess, is the word 
for my Angelina. She kissed me 
with what can only be described as 
true passion and I, clanking my 
lengths of chain, got my arms 
around her in happy response. But 
she squawked and straight-armed 
me. I reeled back, choking. 

“The time!” She looked at her 
watch and gasped. “You made me 
forget. There is less than a minute 
left. Where is the time helix?” 
“Here.” Hugging my still painful 
midriff I showed her the machine. 
“And the controls?” 

“These.” 

“How ugly. Where’s readout?” 
“These dials.” 

“This is the setting we must use, 
down to the thirteenth decimal 
position, Coypu said— he was most, 
insistent about that.” 

I played the keys like a mad 
pianist and sweated. The dials spun 
and hesitated, then gyrated wildly. 

“Thirty seconds,” Angelina said 
sweetly to encourage me. 

“There!” I gasped as she 
announced ten seconds. I kicked 
in the timer and threw the master 
switch. The time helix glowed 
greenly at us as we rushed to its 
protruding end. 

“Stay close and hug me as hard 
as you can,” I said. “The time field 
has a surface effect so we must stay 
close — ” 



She responded with pleasure. 

“I only wish 1 weren’t wearing 
this silly spacesuit,” she whispered, 
nibbling my ear. “It would be so 
much more fun.” 

“It might be, but it might also be 
a little embarrassing when we 
arrived back at the Special Corps 
in that condition.” 

“Don’t worry about that. We’re 
not going back yet.” 

I felt a sudden stab of anxiety just 
below my sternum. 

“What do you mean? Where are 
we going?” 

- “I’m sure I wouldn’t know. All 
Coypu said was that the hop would 
be about twenty thousand years 
into the future, to the moment just 
before this planet is to be 
destroyed.” 

“He and'his mad mob again,” I 
wailed. “You’ve just sent us off to 
tackle an entire planetary insane 
asylum — where everyone is against 
us!” 

Everything froze as the time helix 
actuated and I was whipped into 
time with a pained expression on 
my face. That expression lasted 
20,000 years, which was exactly 
how it felt. 

B LAM\ It was like falling into a 
steam bath— and falling was 
the right word. Hot clouds of vapor 
rushed past us and the invisible 
surface could be ten "meters or ten 
miles below us. 

“Switch on your grav-chute,” I 
shouted. “Mine’s back in the 



THE STAINLESS STEEL RAT’S RETURN

nonexistent nineteenth century.” 

Perhaps I shouldn’t have 
shouted. Angelina turned the thing 
on at full lift and slithered up out 
of my fond embrace like an oiled 
eel. I clutched madly and managed 
to grab one of her feet with both 
hands — whereupon the boot part 
of the one-piece spacesuit promptly 
came off her foot. 

“I wish you wouldn’t do that,” 
she called down to me. “I agree 
with you completely,” I answered 
through clamped and grating teeth. 

The suit stretched and stretched 
until the leg was twice its normal 
length and I bobbed up and on 
down as though on the end of a 
rubber band. I took a quick look 
down, but only fog was visible 
below. Spacesuit fabric is tough, 
but it was never designed to take 
the strain I was putting on 
Angelina’s. Something had to be 
done. 

“Cut your lift,” I called out and 
Angelina responded instantly. 

We were in free fall and as soon 
as the tension was relieved the leg 
fabric contracted and snapped me 
back up to Angelina’s waiting 
arms. 

“Yum,” I said. 

She looked down and shrieked 
and hit the grav-chute power 
again. This time I wasn’t ready and 
I slipped right down and out of her 
embrace and was falling toward 
the solid looking landscape that had 
suddenly appeared below. 

In the small fraction of a second 

76 



left to me I did what little I could— 
twisting in the air, spreading my 
arms and legs wide, trying to land 
square on my back. I had almost 
succeeded when I hit. 

Everything went black. I was sure 
I was dead. Before the darkness 
overwhelmed my brain my last 
thought flashed before me— not 
only did I not regret anything I had 
ever done but there were a few 
things I wished I had done more 
often, 

I could not have been uncon- 
scious more than a few instants. 
Foul-tasting mud filled my mouth 
and I spluttered it out, rubbed 
more of it from my eyes and 
looked around. I was floating in a 
sea of mud and water from which 
large bubbles rose and broke with 
slow plops. They stank. Sickly 
looking reeds and water plants 
grew on all sides. 

“Alive!” I shouted, “I am alive.” 
I had struck fiat out on the syrupy 
surface and felt some aches and 
bruises, but nothing seemed to be 
broken. 

“It looks very nasty down there,” 
Angelina said, hovering a few feet 
above my head. 

“It’s just as nasty as it looks so, 
if you don’t mind, I would like to 
get out of it. Can you sort of drop 
down so I can grab your ankles 
which will permit ydu to drag me 
out with a wet sucking sound?” 

A LARGE, wet sucking sound 
it was as the decaying quag- 

IF 




mire fought to hold onto me, 
parting with me only reluctantly 
and with a slobbering sigh. I hung 
from my love’s ankles as we drifted 
over an apparently endless swamp 
which vanished in the fog in all 
directions. 

“There— over to the right,” I 
called out. “Looks like a channel 
with running water. I think a wash 
and brush-up is in order.” 

“Since I am upwind of you I 
couldn’t agree more.” 

The current was moving slowly, 
but still moving; I could tell by a 
treetrunk that drifted by. Into the 
middle of the sluggish stream 
reached a golden sandbar that 
seemed made for us. 1 dropped as 
Angelina came low and even before 
she had settled down herself I was 
out of my noisome garb and 
scrubbing the muck off in the 
water. When I bobbed up, splutter- 
ing, I saw that she had peeled out 
of her spacesuit and was combing 
out her long hair, which happened 
to be blond at the moment. Very 
lovely, and I was thinking the most 
romantic thoughts when fierce fire 
pierced my gluteus maximus and 
I shot straight up out of the water, 
yiping like a dog whose tail has 
been caught in the door. As attrac- 
tive and feminine as she was, 
Angelina was still Angelina and the 
comb vanished to be replaced by a 
gun and, almost before I touched 
the sand, she had fired a single, 
precisely aimed shot. 

While she was applying a 



bandage to the double row of tooth- 
marks in my derriere I looked at 
the fish, somewhat blown apart 
but still twitching, that had mis- 
taken me for lunch. Its gaping 
mouth had more teeth than a 
dental supply house and there was 
a definitely evil look in its rapidly 
clouding eye. Grabbing it by the 
tail to evade its still gnashing jaws, 

I threw it far out into the water. 
This started a tremendous flurry of 
action under the surface and from 
the size of some of the things that 
leaped ojjt and smacked back down 
I saw that I had been attacked by 
one of the smaller ones. 

“Twenty thousand years has 
done no good at all to this planet,” 

I said. 

“Finish rinsing off that mud and 
I’ll stand guard. Then we’ll have 
some lunch.” 

Ever the practical woman. 

While I scrubbed she shot up the 
piscatorial predators who came 
after me, including one large fish 
with fat flanks and rudimentary 
legs that waddled out of the water 
in an attempt to have me for lunch. 
We had it~4nstead. The flanks 
concealed some fine thick filets 
that roasted well over a low-set 
heat projector. Angelina had had 
the foresight to bring a flask of 
my favorite wine and the meal 
became a memorable one. I 
sighed, eructated and wiped my 
lips with satisfaction. 

“You have saved my life more 
than once in the last twenty thou-

sand years,” I said. “So I no longer 
am brimful of anger for being 
whisked to this steam-bath world 
rather than back to the Corps. But 
can you at least tell me what 
happened and what Coypu told 
you?” 

“He tends to mumble a good 
deal, but I got the gist of it. He has 
been working on his time-tracker 
or whatever he calls it and followed 
your jumps through time as well 
as those of someone he referred to 
as the enemy — the one you call He. 
The enemy did something with 
time, created a probability loop 
that lasted about five years, then 
terminated. He left this collapsing 
loop— and you didn’t. That’s why 
Coypu sent me back to the minutes 
just before it ended — to bring you 
out. He gave me the setting for the 
time helix that would enable us to 
follow He to this time. I asked him 
what we were supposed to 'do here 
but he kept muttering, Paradox , 
paradox . and wouldn’t tell me. 
Do you have any idea of what is 
supposed to happen.” 

“Simple enough. Find He and 
kill him. That should put paid to 
the entire operation. I’ve had two 
tries at him — shooting once and 
using thermite bombs the second 
time — and haven’t succeeded. 
Maybe this will be lucky three.” 

“Perhaps you ought to let me 
take care of him,” Angelina offered 
kindly. 

“A fine idea. We’ll blast him 
together. I have had just about 



enough of this temporal paper 
chase.” 

“How do we find him?” 

“Simplicity itself, if you have a 
time-energy detector with you.” 
She had one through Coypu’ s 
foresight and passed it over. “A 
simple flick of this switch and the 
moving needle points to our man.” 

The switch flicked but did noth- 
ing more than release a little con- 
densed water that ran out into my 
palm. 

“It doesn’t seem to be working,” 
Angelina said, smiling sweetly. 

“Either that or He is not using 
the time helix at this particular 
moment.” I rummaged in my 
equipment. “I had to leave my 
spacesuit and some other things 
back in eighteen-oh-seven, but 
Slippery Jim is never without his 
snooper.” 

I WAS proud of the gadget. I 
had designed it myself and it 
was one of the few things He hadn’t 
taken from me. Rugged, it could 
resist almost anything except being 
dropped into molten metal. Com- 
pact, no bigger than my hand. And 
it could detect the weakest flicker- 
ings of radiation across a tremen- 
dous range of frequencies. I turned 
it on and ran my fingers over the 
familiar controls. 

“Most interesting,” I said and 
tried the radio frequencies. 

“If you don’t enlighten me 
quickly I’ll never save your life 
again.”

IF 




“You have to because you love 
me with an undying passion. I get 
two sources, one weak and very 
distant. The other can’t be too far 
and is putting out on a number of 
frequencies, including atomic 
radiation and energy transmission, 
as well as a lot of radio. And some- 
thing of more pressing urgency. 
Get out the sunburn cream — solar 
ultraviolet radiation is right up at 
the top of the scale. You can bet 
I’ve been well cooked already.” 

We creamed and, despite the 
heat, put on enough clothing to 
shield us from the invisible radia- 
tion that was pouring out of the 
clouded sky. 

“Strange things have ' happened 
to the Earth,” I said. “The radia- 
tion, this soggy climate, the wild- 
life in this river. I wonder—” 

“I don’t. After completing the 
mission you can do your paleogeo- 
logic research. Let’s kill He first.” 
“Spoken like a pro. I hope you 
don’t mind if I rig a harness so we 
can share the benefit of the grav- 
chute equally this time?” 

“Sounds like fun,” she said, 
loosening the straps. 

The airborne Siamese Jwin 
arrangement lifted and took us 
low over the sea of gunk in the 
direction of all the activity. Mud 
and swamp continued for a 
boringly long time and I was 
beginning to chafe in the straps and 
worry about the power supply when 
the higher larid finally appearedr 
First some rocks sticking out of the 



water, then sheer cliffs greeted us. 
It took more juice to lift us up the 
side of these and the indicator on 
the power pack dropped quickly. 

“We are going to have to walk 
soon,” I said, “which is at least 
better than swimming.” 

“Not if the land animals match 
those in the water.” 

Ever optimistic my Angelina. As 
I was phrasing a witty and scathing 
reply there was a flash of light 
from the rampart of rocks ahead, 
followed instantly by an intense 
pain in my leg. 

“I’ve been shot!” I shouted, 
more in surprise than pain, reach- 
ing for the grav-chute controls and 
finding that Angelina had already 
killed the power. 

We dropped toward a wicked 
jumple of rocks, slowing and 
stopping only at the last minute. 
I hopped on one leg to the shelter 
of an overhanging slab and was 
thinking of digging out my medikit 
when Angelina sprayed antiseptic 
on the wound* tore half of my pants 
leg away, injected instant painkiller 
in my thigh and probed the gory 
opening. She was ahead of me with 
everything and I didn’t mind in the 
slightest. 

“A neat penetrating wound,” she 
announced, spraying on surgifoam. 
“Should heal quickly, no problem. 
Keep your weight off it. Now I 
have to kill whoever did it.” 

ALL the drugs had slowed me 
XX down and before I could

answer she had her gun in her hand 
and had faded silently into the 
rocky landscape. There is nothing 
like having a loving and tender wife 
who is a cool and accomplished 
killer. Maybe I wore the pants in 
the family, but we both wore guns. 

Not too long after this came the 
sound of explosions, a great 
clattering in the rocks above and, 
soon after that, some hoarse 
screams that soon ended in silence. 
It is a tribute to Angelina’s prowess 
that I never for a second was con- 
cerned about her safety. In fact, I 
dozed off under the assault of the 
drugs coursing through my blood- 
stream and awoke only when I was 
aware of tugging on the grav-chute 
harness. I yawned and blinked at 
her as she buckled in beside me. 

“Am I allowed to ask what 
happened?” I said. 

She frowned. “Just one man up 
there. I couldn’t find any others. I 
saw a farm building of sorts, some 
machinery, crops growing. I must 
be slipping. I knocked him out, 
then could not bring myself to 
shoot him while he was lying there 
unconscious.” 

I kissed her as we rose. 

“A conscience, my sweet. Some 
of us are born with them, yours was 
surgically implanted. The results 
are the same.” 

“I’m not really sure I like it. 
There was a certain freedom in the 
old days.” 

“We all have to be civilized some 
time.” 



She sighed and nodded, then gave 
me a quick peck on the cheek. 

“I suppose you are right. But it 
would have been so satisfying to 
blow him into small pieces.” 

We were over the last of the 
tumbled scree now and ascending a 
small cliff. We came to a plateau, 
on which was a low building made 
of stones cemented together. The 
door was open and I hobbled 
through it, leaning on Angelina’s 
shoulder. Dim light through the 
small windows revealed a large 
and cluttered room with two bunks 
against the far wall. On one of them 
lay a bound man twisting, and 
turning, mumbling and growling 
into a gag that sealed his mouth. 

“You get into the other bed,” 
Angelina told me, “while I see if I 
can get any intelligence out of this 
awful creature.” 

I had actually taken the first 
steps toward the bunk before 
reason penetrated my soggy 
thoughts and I stopped dead. 

“Beds. Two of them? There must 
be someone else around the place.” 
Whatever answer was on her 
lips was never spoken because a 
man appeared in the doorway 
behind us, shouting noisily and 
firing an even noisier weapon. 



II 

H E WAS shouting mainly 
because the weapon was 
blown from his hands even as he 



80 



IF 




triggered it, and an instant later he 
was blown back out of the doorway. 
I saw all this as I dived and rolled. 

1 had my gun out just an Angelina 
was putting hers away. 

“Now that is more like it,” she 
sakl, apparently addressing the 
silent pair of boots in the doorway. 
“Civilized conscience or no, I find 
that shooting in self-defense still 
comes easily. I .saw this one out 
among the rocks, stalking us as we 
came in, but I never had a clear 
shot. Everything should be quietef 
now. I’ll make some warm soup 
and you take a nice nap—” 

“No.” I doubt if a firmer no had 
ever been spoken. I popped out a 
pair of stimtabs and chewed them 
as I continued my monologue in 
the same tone of voice. “There is a 
certain retrogressive pleasure in 
being cared for and treated like an 
idiot child, but I think I have had 
enough of it. I have tackled He 
before this and chased him out of 
two of his lairs and I intend now 
to finish him off. I know his ways. 
I’m in charge of this expedition. 
You will follow, not lead. And you 
will obey orders.” 

“Yes, sir,” she answered with 
lowered eyelids and bowed head. 
Did this cover a mocking smile? I 
did not care. Me boss. 

“Me boss.” It sounded even 
better said aloud in a firm and 
declaratory tone. 

“Yes, boss,” she said and 
giggled prettily while the man on 
the bed writhed and chomped and 



the boots in the doorway were 
silent. 

We went to work. Our prisoner 
slavered noisily in an unknown 
tongue when I took out the gag. He 
tried to bite my fingers when I 
restored it. A rough-looking radio 
on a shelf produced only grating 
broadcasts in the same alien lan- 
guage when I turned it on. 
Angelina’s outdoor investigations 
were far more productive than 
mine and she pulled up by the door 
in an impossibly ugly conveyance 
that looked like a scratched, purple, 
plastic bathtub slung between four 
sets of wheels. It burbled and hissed 
at me when I hobbled up to 
examine it. 

“Very simple to operate,” 
Angelina said, showing off her 
technical skill. “There is only one 
switch and that turns it on. And two 
handles, one for the bank of wheels 
on each side. Forward to speed 
them up, back to brake them—” 

“And neutral in the middle,” I 
said to demonstrate my technical 
skill as well as the fact that I was a 
male chauvinist pig and this was 
my show. “And this lead-covered 
lump in the rear must be a nuclear 
generator. Unshield a chunk of 
radioactive material, heat up the 
surrounding liquid — a heat- 

exchanger here, secondary liquid 
to turn this electric generator, 
motors in each wheel, ugly and 
crude but practical. Where do we 
go in it?” 

She pointed. “There seems to be 



THE STAINLESS STEEL RAT’S RETURN 



81 




a road or trail of sorts going off 
through that cultivated field there. 
And unless memory fails— I know 
you will be quick to correct me— 
that seems to be the direction 
indicated by the radio signals you 
detected earlier.” 

A mild blow struck for femlib 
and I ignored it. Particularly since 
she was right as the snooper soon 
confirmed. 

“Off we go then,” I said, in 
command once again. 

“Going to kill the prisoner?” 
she asked hopefully. 

“Thank you, no. But I’ll take 
his clothes, since mine have reached 
the old rag stage. If we break up 
the radio he’ll have a hard job 
telling anyone we’re coming. He’ll 
chew through his gag and ropes in 
a couple of hours so we can leave 
the burial arrangements of his 
associate to him. We will load our 
gear and be on our way.” 

The firmness of my authority was 
dimmed slightly by the rapid, red- 
blooming growth of my sunburn. 
While Angelina stomped the radio 
I put on more cream. A few 
minutes later we were bumping 
along the worn trail that twisted 
across the high plateau. 

T HE fog and haze were less at 
this altitude — not that there 
was anything more to see. The 
rough landscape was slashed with 
gullies that carried away the water 
from the frequent rainstorms, 
which also removed what little 



topsoil still remained in the area. 
Tough-looking plants clung to the 
rocks for protection and scant 
shelter. Occasionally we passed 
branching side trails but the 
direction finder on the snooper kept 
us on the right track. The hard 
bucket seats were hideously 
uncomfortable and I welcomed the 
gathering darkness of dusk — 
though of course I didn’t say this 
aloud— and turned off behind a 
jumbled hill of great rocks for the 
night. 

In the morning I was stiff but. 
feeling more fit. The drugs had 
whipped my cells into a frenzy of 
growth that had nearly healed my 
various wounds and given me a 
raging appetite. We breakfasted 
from the meager supplies that 
Angelina had brought, eked out 
by some coarse bread and dried 
meat liberated from the homicidal 
farmers. Angelina took the wheel 
and I rode shotgun, not liking the 
look of the decomposing landscape 
at all. The track now wandered 
down from the hills as the highlands 
turned into a vertical escarpment 
of rock. Then there were more 
swamps and some very nasty look- 
ing jungle into which the road 
dipped. Creepers hung low enough 
to brush our heads, and the soggy 
trees touched overhead. The air 
became more humid and hotter. 

“I don’t like this place,” 
Angelina said, steering around a 
boggy spot that slopped across the 
track. 



82 



IF 




“I like it even less,” I said, gun 
in hand and a clip of explosive 
cartridges in the butt. “If the 
wildlife here is anything like that 
in the river we may have some fun 
and games in store.” 

I looked ahead, behind, right and 
left and wished my eyeballs grew on 
stalks. I saw countless suspicious 
dark shapes among the trees and 
heard occasional heavy crashings, 
but nothing appeared to threaten 
us. Nothing that I could see. Of 
course the one spot 1 wasn’t watch- 
ing was the surface of the road and 
that is where the imminent danger 
lay. 

“That tree has fallen right across 
the road,” Angelina said. “Just 
bump over it—” 

“I wouldn’t,” I said, just a little 
too late as our wheels trundled over 
the green trunk that lay across the 
track and vanished into the jungle 
on both sides. 

Our center wheels were on it 
when it shuddered and heaved 
upward in a great loop. The vehicle 
turned over. Angelina and I were 
hurled clear, but not clear enough. 
I hit the ground, tucked my head 
in, rolled and came up with the 
gun ready. A good thing, too. The 
fallen pseudo-tree was writhing 
nicely, while out of the foliage 
across the track appeared the front 
end of the thing. 

A snake. With a head as big as a 
barrel, gaping mouth, flicking 
tongue, beady eyes and a hiss like a 
boiler about to explode. Right 



under those wide-spread jaws was 
Angelina, sitting up and shaking 
her head dizzily and totally 
unaware of what was happening. 
There was time for one shot and I 
wanted it to be a good one. As that 
demonic head came down I held 
my wrist with my left hand to 
steady the gun and squeezed off a 
round right into the thing’s mouth. 
Its head was blown off. 

That should have been the end 
of it— but a gigantic spasm went 
through the entire length of that 
muscular body. Before I could get 
out of the way a thrashing loop 
struck me and hurled me into the 
trees. This time there was no fancy 
roll and dive but a simple splintery 
bang as I crashed through the 
branches and one got me on the 
side of the head. A nice white 
explosion of pain and that was 
that. 

T IME passed that I was not 
aware of. The ache in my head 
drew me back to reluctant con- 
sciousness and the discovery of a 
new and sharper pain in my leg. 
I opened a bleary eye and saw 
something small and brown with a 
lot of claws and teeth that was 
tearing an opening in my pants 
leg in order to make lunch out of 
my thigh. I kicked it with my boot. 
It growled and screeched and 
showed me all its teeth but reluc- 
tantly slipped away into the foliage 
when I attempted another weak 
kick in its direction. 



THE STAINLESS STEEL RATS RETURN 



83 




Weak was the word for every- 
thing I felt. It took me some time to 
do more than lie there and gasp and 
try to remember what had 
happened. The road, the snake, the 
wreck . 

“Angelina!” I shouted hoarsely 
and struggled to my feet, ignoring 
the waves of pain that washed 
through me. “Angelina—”' 

There was no answer. I pushed 
through the shrubbery to witness a 
singularly nasty sight. A churning 
row of brown animals, relatives of 
the one who had nibbled me, was 
working on the carcass of the snake 
and had already reduced great 
sections to a neatly polished rib 
cage. And my gun was gone. I 
turned back and searched where I 
had fallen but it was not there. 
Something was wrong, seriously 
wrong, and the shrill voice of panic 
was beginning to keen in the back 
of my head. 

As long as I stayed clear of them 
the carrion eaters ignored me. I 
made a wide loop to cross the road. 
The car was gone— and so was 
Angelina. 

The situation required cogent 
thought, impossible with the aches 
and pains that were crippling me. 
And I had to do something about 
the insects that were buzzing about 
the wound in my head. My medikit 
was still in its pocket and that was 
next in the order of business. In a 
few minutes I was soothed, de- 
pained, stimulated and ready for 
action. But where was the action? 



Wherever the car was, my clicking 
thoughts responded. Its tracks were 
clear enough in the muddy 
ground — which also revealed the 
mystery of Angelina’s disappear- 
ance. I found at least two sets of 
large, ugly, masculine footprints 
around the churned area where the 
vehicle had been righted — as well 
as another set of car tracks. Either 
we had been followed or a chance 
bunch of tourists had arrived on 
the scene after the snake incident. 
Spatters of mud and bent grass 
showed that both cars had carried' 
on in the original direction we had 
been going. I went that way myself 
at a ground-eating trot, trying not 
to think about what might have 
happened to Angelina. 

The trot didn’t last long. 
Fatigue and heat slowed me to a 
shambling walk. A stimtab took 
care of one and I just sweated out 
the other. The tracks were clear and 
I followed. In less than an hour the 
road had wound its way out of the 
jungle and into some dry hills. 
Coming around a turn I had' a 
quick glimpse of one of the cars 
pulled up ahead and I drew back 
quickly. 

A plan was needed. My gun had 
vanished so shooting / down 
Angelina’s kidnapers was out of 
the question. The few remaining 
devices in my clothing were non- 
lethal, though I did have a wrist 
holder full of grenades that 
Angelina had given me. They were 
the answer. 



84 



IF 




I selected a handful of sieepgas 
bombs to drop the kidnapers 
before they could shoot me and 
took a couple of explosive grenades 
in the other hand just in case any 
of the enemy were not near 
Angelina and heeded more 
dramatic and permanent disposal. 

Armed and ready, I crept for- 
ward from rock to .rock, took a 
deep breath and jumped into the 
clearing where both vehicles waited. 

And caught a wooden club in the 
side of my head. 

I WAS out long enough for my 
wrists and ankles to be tied and 
my weapons to be stripped from 
me. For this disaster I can blame 
only myself and my inattention. 
Fatigue and stimulants may -have 
contributed, but my own stupidity 
had been the cause. I cursed myself 
under my breath— which did no 
good at all — as 1 was dragged 
across the ground and dumped 
down beside Angelina. 

“Are you all right?” I asked. 
“Of course. And in far better 
shape than you are.” 

Which was true. Her clothing was 
torn and I saw bruises. She had 
been knocked around. Someone 
was going to pay and pay well for 
that. I could hear my teeth grating 
together. And she was tied just as 
I was. 

“They thought you were dead,” 
she said. “And so did I.” Her 
words held a wealth of unsaid 
feeling and I tried a smile. It came 



on a little more twisted than I 
like. She went on: “I don’t know 
how long we lay there— I was 
unconscious, too. When I came to 
I was like this and they had taken 
ihe guns and everything and were 
loading it all into the cars. Then we 
left. I could do nothing to stop 
them. All they speak is that same 
horrible language.” 

They looked as horrible as their 
language sounded, all scruffy 
clothing and greasy leather straps, 
bushels of matted dirty hair and 
beard. I had an entirely unneces- 
ary closer look at one of them when 
he came over and twisted my head 
to one side and the other while he 
compared my crunched features 
with a good photograph of me. I 
snapped my tfceth at the filthy 
fingers but he pulled them away in 
time. These must be He’s men— 
the photo proved that— though I 
had no idea where it came from. 
Taken during one of our tangles in 
time no doubt and treasured by 
his crew ever since. At this point I 
noticed the ugliest and smelliest of 
the lot ogling Angelina. I snapped 
at his ankle and was kicked aside 
for my pains. 

Angelina is a very direct-minded 
girl. When she knows what she 
wants she gets it, no matter what. 
Now she saw the only way we could 
get out of this mess and she used it. 
Woman’s wiles. With no hint of 
- disgust at the ugly brute she began 
to openly to lavish her attention 
upon him. She could not speak his 



THE STAINLESS STEEL RAPS RETURN 



85 




language but the language she did 
speak was as old as mankind. 
Turning away from me she smiled 
at the hairy beast and gave a twist 
of her head to call him over. Her 
shoulders were back, her charming 
figure prominent, hips tilted coyly.' 

Of course it worked: There was a 
bit of lively dicussion with the 
other two, but Hairiest knocked 
one of them down and that was 
that. They looked on with burning 
jealousy as he stalked over to her. 
She smiled her warmest and held 
out her slim, bound wrists. 

What man could resist that 
unspoken appeal? Certainly not 
this shambling hulk. He cut the 
thongs on her wrists and put his 
knife away as she bent to free her 
ankles. When he hauled her to her 
feet she arose eagerly. He locked 
her in a bearlike embrace, bending 
his face to hers. 

I could have told him that he 
would have been safer trying to kiss 
a sabertooth tiger but I did not. 
What happened next only I could 
see because the jealous watchers 
were blocked from sight by the 
bulk of his body. Who would 
imagine that those delicate fingers 
could shape themselves into that 
hard a point, that the thin wrist 
could propel the hand so deep into 
bushy’s gut? Lovely. He bent to her 
and, with only a gentle sigh, kept 
bending. For. a moment she 
supported his weight — then stepped 
back and screamed as he folded to 
the ground. 



A picture of feminine innocence, 
hands to cheeks, eyes staring, 
shrieking at the strange occurrence 
of a strong man collapsing at her 
feet. Of course the other two ran 
over, but their faces showed the 
beginnings of cold suspicion. The 
first one carried my gun. 

ANGELINA took care of him. 
XI As soon as he was close 
enough she let fly with bushy’s 
knife, which she had appropriated 
before she dropped him. I did not 
see where it hit because the third 
man was passing me and I had 
drawn my legs back in hopes that 
he would. He did. I kicked out, 
got him below the knees and he 
went down. Even as he fell I was 
jack-knifing forward and before he 
could get up again I let him have it 
with both boots in the side of the 
head. And a second time just be- 
cause I was feeling nasty. 

That was that. Angelina removed 
the knife from her unmoving tar- 
get, wiped it on his clothing, then 
came to free me. 

“Will you kill the ones who are 
still twitching?’’ she asked 
demurely. 

“I should, but cold-blooded 
revenge is not for me. They are 
what they are and I suppose that is 
penalty enough. I think if we took 
all their supplies and wrecked their 
wagon it would be revenge enough. 
You were wonderful.’’ 

“Of course. That was why you 
married me.’’ She kissed me

quickly because she had to turn an 
instant later to land her heel on 
the forehead of bushy, who was 
beginning to twitch. He slept on. 
We packed and left. 

Our goal was not too far away. 
A few hours later we felt a stirring 
of the air that grew stronger as we 
continued down the track through 
the hills. A sudden turn brought 
us to the brink of a valley with a 
sharp drop and 1 kicked the vehicle 
into a swirling spin and darted it 
back out of sight again. 

“Did you see that?” I asked. 

“I certainly did,” Angelina re- 
plied as we slipped forward on our 
bellies and looked around the turn. 

The wind was stronger here, 
pouring up the wide valley from 
some invisible source below. The 
air was. cooler, too, and though the 
ever-present clouds hung above, no 
fog obscured the view in the valley. 
Across from us the hill rose, turn- 
ing to a solid cliff that reared up 
vertically, glossy black stone. 
Erosion had carved it into a fantasy 
of towers* and turrets — men had 
carved these further into a castle 
city that covered the mountaintop. 

There were windows and door- 
ways, flags and . pennants, stairs 
and buttresses. The flags were 
bright red and inscribed with black 
characters. Some of the towers had 
been painted crimson as well and 
this, with the mad frenzy of the 
construction, nieant only one thing. 

“It’s not logical, 1 know,’* Ange- 
lina said. “But that place sends a 



definite shiver down my spine. It 
seems— hard to describe— perhaps 
Insane is the best word.” 

“The absolute best. Which means 
that since this is the right world 
and time, a place that looks like 
that must be where He is.” 

“How do we get to him?” 

“A very good question,” I said 
in lieu of an intelligent answer. 
How did we get into this kooky- 
castle? I scratched my head and 
rubbed my jaw but these infallible 
aids to thought did not work this 
time. There was a slight movement 
at the edge of my vision. I looked 
and grabbed for my. gun— and 
froze the motion. halfway. 

“Don’t make any sudden mo- 
tions, particularly in the direction 
of your weapon,” I told Angelina 
in a quiet voice. “Turn around 
slowly.” 

W E BOTH turned slowly, 
doing nothing that might 
produce anxiety in the trigger fin- 
gers of the dozen or so men who 
had appeared silently behind us and 
stood with leveled and firmly aimed 
weapons. 

“Get ready to dive forward when 
I do,” I said and turned back to see 
another four men who had ap- 
peared just as silently in the valley 
in front of us. “Belay that last 
command and smile sweetly and 
surrender. We’ll chop them up 
after we get in among them.” 

This last I meant mostly as a 
morale booster. Unlike the wild- 



THE STAINLESS STEEL RAPS RETURN 



87 




eyed men from whom we had taken 
our multiwheeled transportation, 
this lot was cool and able. These 
men were dressed alike in gray one- 
piece plastic outfits equipped with 
hoods. Their weapons were as long 
as rifles, gape-orificed and lethal 
looking. We trotted forward obe- 
diently when one of them waved 
that instruction in our direction. 
Another member of the closing 
circle stepped closer to look us 
over, but not close enough for 
anyone who wasn’t suicide prone 
to attempt to seize his weapon. 

“ Stragitzkruml ?" he said, then 
continued: “Fidlykreepi? Atten- 

tottenpotentaten ?'* 

When we made no response to 
these incomprehensible requests he 
turned to a bulky man with a red 
beard who seemed to be in charge. 

‘7// ne parolas konantajn ling- 
vojri,” he said in clearly accented 
Esperanto. 

“Well that’s more like it,” I 
answered in the same tongue. 
“Might I ask why you gentlemen 
find it necessary to pull guns on 
simple travelers like ourselves?” 
“Who are you?” Redbeard 
asked, coming forward. 

“I might ask the same of you.” 
“/ am pointing the guns,” he 
answered coldly. 

“A well made point and I bow 
to your logic. We are tourists from 
the land across the sea — ” He 
interrupted with a short and nasty 
word. 

“That is impossible as we both 



know, since this is the only land 
mass on this planet. The truth 
now.” 

We both hadn’t known, though 
we did now. A single continent? 
What had happened to Mother 
Earth during those twenty millen- 
nia? Lying had been no good so 
perhaps the truth might work. It 
did on occasion. 

“Would you believe me if I told 
you we were time-travelers?” 

T HIS hit the target, all right. He 
looked startled and there was a 
stir of movement among the men 
who had been close enough to hear 
what I had said. Redbeard glared 
them into silence before he spoke 
again. 

“What is your connection with 
He and those creatures in his city 
up there?” 

A lot depended upon my answer. 
Truth had worked once and it 
might turn the trick again. And he 
had said creatures — a giveaway. I 
could not believe this calm and 
disciplined force could be asso- 
ciated with the enemy. 

“I have come to kill He and wipe 
out his operation.” 

This really did produce the right 
effect. Some of the men even 
lowered their guns before being 
growled back into line. Redbeard 
uttered a command and one of the 
men hurried away. We remained in 
silence ' until he returned with a 
green metal cube about the size

IF 




of his head that he handed to the 
commander. It must have been 
hollow because he carried it 
easily. Redbeard held it up. 

“We have over a hundred of 
these. They have been floating 
down out of the sky for the past 
month and all of them are identical. 
A powerful radio source inside 
leads us ta them— but we cannot 
cut or dissolve the metal. On the 
outside, on five faces of the cube, 
they are covered with lines of writ- 
ing in what appear to be different 
languages and scripts. The ones we 
can translate all read the same 
way: ‘Bring this to the time- 
travelers.’ On the bottom of the 
cube are two lines of writing that 
we cannot read. Can you?’’ 

He slowly extended the cube 
toward me and I took it just as 
gingerly, while every gun was 
trained on me. The metal looked 
like collapsium, the incredibly 
tough stuff used for atomic rocket- 
tube liners. I carefully turned it 
bottom up and read the lines at a* 
single glance before handing it 
back. 

“I can read them.’’ I said, and 
they were aware of the new tohe in 
my voice. “The first line says that 
He and his people will all leave this 
period in time exactly two point 
thirty-seven days after my arrival 
. here.” 

A murmur rose. Angelina beat 
Redbeard to the punch with the 
important question. 

“What was in the second line?” 



I tried a smile but it didn’t seem 
much good. 

“Oh, that. It says that the planet 
will be destroyed by atomic ex- 
plosions as soon as they go.” 



Ill 

T 1 HE tent was made of the same 
gray plastic as the clothes our 
captors wore and was a chilled re- 
fuge from the steambath atmo- 
sphere outside. A squat machine 
whirred in one corner, dehumidify- 
ing and cooling the air. Even cooler 
drinks had been produced and I 
drained and brooded over mine, 
trying to see a way out of this di- 
lemma before the deadly deadline 
was reached. Though guns were 
still in evidence an unspoken truce 
was in effect— Redbeard decided 
to formalize it. 

“I drink with you,” he said. “I 
am Diyan.” 

It seemed very much like a ritual 
so I repeated the formula and intro-* 
duced myself as did Angelina. 
After this the weapons vanished 
and we were all much more 
chummy. I sat down where I could 
benefit from the full breeze of the 
air-cooler and decided to ask some 
questions. 

“Do you people have any weap- 
ons heavier than these handguns?” 
“None that are available. The 
few we brought have been de- 
stroyed in battle with He’s forces.” 
“Is this continent so big you

/ 

can’t get more of them here quickly 
from your country?” 

“The size of the continent is of no 
importance. Our space vessels are 
very small and everything must be 
brought from our home planet.” 

I blinked rapidly, feeling I was 
getting out my depth. 

“You are not from Earth?” I 
asked. * 

“Our ancestors were, but we are 
all native born Martians;” 

“You wouldn’t care to give me a 
few more facts, would you? The 
sound of confusion I keep hearing 
appears to be inside my own head ”, 

I am sorry. I thought you knew: 
Here/ let me fill your glass. The 
story really begins many thousands 
of years ago when a sudden change 
in solar radiation raised the tem- 
perature here on Earth. By sudden 
I mean a matter of centuries. As 
the climate changed and the ice 
caps melted, the continued existence 
of life on the surface of the planet 
was threatened. Coastlines were 
altered and immense areas of low- 
lying land inundated; great cities 
were drowned. This in itself might 
have been dealt with, had it not 
been for the seismic disturbances 
brought about by the shifting 
stresses on the Earth’s surface as 
the poles were freed of their ice 
burden and the released water 
covered other areas. There were 
earthquakes and lava flows, sinking 
lands and the rising of new moun- 
tains. All quite terrible — we have 
seen the recordings many times in 



our schools. An incredible inter- 
national effort was launched to 
terrafy the planet Mars-^that is, 
make it suitable for human habita- 
tion. This involved the creation of 
an atmosphere there with a high 
carbon dioxide layer to trap the 
increased radiation of the sun, the 
transportation of ice mountains 
from the rings of Saturn, things 
like this. It was a noble ambition 
that in the end did succeed, but it 
bankrupted the nations of Earth 
who gave their all in this unbe- 
lievable effort. Eventually there was 
dissent and even warfare as weak- 
ened governments fell and greedy 
men fought for more than an equal 
share of space on the new-made 
world. Through all of this the 
waters continued to rise on Earth 
and the first Martian settlers 
struggled against the harsh rigors 
of a barely livable world to estab- 
lish the settlements. In history these 
are known as the Deadly Years be- 
cause so many people died — the 
figures are unbelievable. But in the 
end we survived and Mars is a 
green and comfortable world. 

“Earth did not fare as well. Con- 
tact was lost between the planets 
and the survivors of the once teem- 
ing billions here fought a dreadful 
battle for survival. There are no 
written records of that period, 
thousands of years long, but the 
results are clear enough. This single 
large continent remained above the 
sea, as well as some island chains 
to mark earlier mountain ranges.

IF 




And madness rules mankind. 
When we were able we rebuilt the 
ancient spaceships and brought 
what help we could. Our help was 
not appreciated. The survivors 
still living on Earth kill strangers 
on sight and take great pleasure in 
it. And all irien are strangers. The 
almost unshielded solar radiation 
here produced mutants of all kinds 
among all Earth’s life forms. Most 
mutations died off quickly but the 
survivors are deadly to a universal 
degree. So we helped where we 
could — but really did very little. 
The Earthmen were a continuing 
danger to each other, but not to 
Mars. That is not until He united 
them some hundreds of years ago:” 

“Has He really lived all that 
time?” 

“It appears that He has. His mind 
is as bent as theirs but he can com- 
municate with them. They follow 
him. They have actually worked 
together in building that city you 
have seen — building a society of 
sorts. He is certainly a genius, 
albeit a warped one. His people 
have factories going and* a rudi- 
mentary technology. One of the 
first things they did was ask for 
more aid from Mars— and they 
would not believe us when we said 
that they were getting the maxi- 
mum already. Their mad demands 
would have not bothered us had 
they not unearthed rockets armed 
with atomic bombs that could be 
directed at our planet. It was after 
the first of these arrived that this 



expedition was organized. On 
Mars we survived by cooperating — 
there was no other way — so we are 
not a warlike people. But we have 
made weapons and will reluctantly 
use them to insure our own sur- 
vival. He is the key to all the 
troubles and we must capture or 
kill him. Thousands are dead at 
home and radioactivity is increas- 
ing in the Martian atmosphere.” 

aims are identical,” I 
V-/told him. “He has launched 
a time attack against out people 
with equally disastrous results. 
You have summed up our retalia- 
tory goals quite neatly.” 

“How do we go about it?” Diyan 
asked eagerly. 

“I’m not sure,” I answered 
gloomily. 

“We have a little over ten 
standard hours left to operate in,” 
Angelina said precisely. Like all 
women she was a true pragmatist. 
While we wasted time nattering 
about the past she faced the fact 
that the decision would have to be 
made in the future and tackled that, 
the real problem. I yearned to 
demonstrate my affection for her 
but decided to wait for a more ap- 
propriate time, if more time did 
exist at all. 

“An all-out attack,” I said. “We 
have weapons we can add to yours. 
Attack on all fronts, find a weak 
spot, concentrate our forces, blast 
through to victory. Do you have 
any large weapons left?” 



THE STAINLESS STEEL RAT’S RETURN 



91 




“No.” 

“Well, we can get around that. 
How about crashlanding one of 
your spacers inside the castle up 
there and getting a fighting force 
behind their backs that way?” 

“Our spacers were destroyed by 
saboteurs, suicidal ones. Others 
are coming from Mars but will ar- 
rive too late. We are not really very 
good at war and killing while they 
have always lived with it.” 

Gloom grew so thick in the air 
you could have cut chunks of it out, 
“The grav-chute,” Angelina said 
quietly so only I heard her. 

“We will use the grav-chute,” I 
said so loudly that all could hear. 
A good general depends on able 
staffwork. The complete plan was 
now clear, written in letters of fire 
before my eyes. “This is a go-for- 
broke operation. Angelina and I 
are going to drain the charges 
from all our unessential equipment 
to put a full charge into the grav- 
chute. Then we will rig a multiple 
harness for this. Til do the exact 
computations later but I would 
guess that it will lift five or six 
people over those walls and inside 
before it bums out. Angelina and I 
are two, the rest will be your best 
people—” 

“A woman — no, this is not work 
for a woman,” Diyan protested. I 
patted his arm understanding^. 

“Have no fear. Sweet and de- 
mure as she is, Angelina can out- 
fight any ten men in this tent. And 
everyone is needed. Because the 



troops outside will be launching a 
quite realistic attack that might 
break through— general at first, 
then concentrating on one flank. 
When the noise is at its highest 
the commando squad will lift over 
the opposite wall and bore from 
within. Now let’s get things 
organized.” 

ANGELINA and I did all the 
XXgroundwork. These peaceful 
Martian plowboys knew nothing 
about scientific slaughter and were 
only too happy to turn the respon- 
sibilities of leadership over to us. 
Once matters were under way I 
lay down for a quick sleep — I had 
been awake or clubbed uncon- 
scious something like two full days 
and 20,000 years and I was under- 
standably tired. The three hours I 
grabbed were certainly not enough 
and I awoke chomping and blink- 
ing. I chewed a stimtab to make up 
the difference. It was dark outside 
the tent and still just as hot. 

“Are we ready to roll?” I asked. 

“Any minute now,” Angelina 
said, cool and relaxed and showing 
no signs of her labors — she must 
have been at the stimtabs, too. 
“We have about four hours to 
dawn and we are going to need 
most of that time to get into posi- 
tion. The attack begins at first 
light.” 

“Do the guides know the way?” 

“They should. They have been 
fighting in and around this position 
for almost a year.” 

IF 



92 




This was the showdown. The 
men were all .aware of it. There 
could be only one winner this day. 
Perhaps they weren’t bom fighters, 
but they were learning fast. If you 
are going to fight you fight to win. 
Diyan showed up with three men 
who carried a jury-rigged metal 
harness with the grav-chute built 
into the center of it. 

“We are ready,” he said. 
“Everyone knows what he is to 
do?” 

“Perfectly. We have already said 
our goodbyes and the first attack 
units have moved out.” 

“Then we’ll get going, too.” 
Diyan led the way, though how 
he found it in that steam-heated 
darkness I have no idea. We 
stumbled behind him, sweating 
and cursing under the burden of 
the clumsy harness, and the less 
said about the following hours the 
better. Dawn found us collapsed 
under the far wall of the fortified 
city, the highest and apparently 
the strongest point. Our target. As 
it appeared out of the haze above 
us, black and grim, it did not look 
at all attractive. I squeezed An- 
gelina’s hand to show her I was 
fearless and to cheer her up. She 
squeezed mine back to show that 
she knew I was just as frightened as 
the rest of them. 

“We’ll d 6 it, Jim,” she said. 
“You know that.” 

“Oh, we’ll do it, all right — the 
continuing existence of our partic- 
ular hunk of the future proves that. 



But it doesn’t indicate how many 
are going to die today — or which 
of us will live into the foreseeable 
future.” 

“We’re immortal,” she said with 
such surety that I had to laugh. 
My morale soared to its usual 
egotistical heights and I kissed 
her soundly and well. 

Explosions sounded suddenly in 
the distance, rumbling and rolling 
like thunder from the rock walls. 
The attack had begun. The clock 
was running and everything was 
timed from here on in. I helped 
everyone strap in and kept an eye 
on my watch at the same time. As 
our scheduled hop-off drew close I 
buckled in as well and touched the 
grav-chute controls. 

“Brace yourselves,” I said, 
watching the numbers flutter past. 
“And be ready to cut free when we 
hit at the other end.” 

I punched the button and with a 
metallic groan from the harness my 
little force of six rose to attack. 



VV7E DRIFTED up the black 
Wface of the rock, sitting ducks 
for anyone with a good gun and a 
keen eye. The sensation was un- 
comfortable to say the least. I had 
to lift off gradually to keep our 
harness from buckling, but I 
speeded up as fast as I could until 
we were on maximum lift. A visible 
aura of heat began to radiate from 
the grav-chute as it struggled 
against all our dead weight. Its

failure now would be highly un- 
pleasant. 

Then deep-cut windows flashed 
by, happily unoccupied — the black 
stone changed to dark wall and the 
crenelated top of the parapet was 
ahead. I angled toward it and cut 
the power completely just before 
we reached the edge. Our accelera- 
tion carried us up and over in a 
high arc and after that events took 
place at an incredibly rapid pace. 

Two guards were on the wall — 
both were surprised, angry, armed 
and about to fire. Angelina and I 
fired first. 'We were using the 
needle guns now in order to remain 
undetected for as long as possible. 
The guards crumpled in silence, 
their faces and necks suddenly 
bristly as pincushions. I hit the 
power button for the landing. 

Landing? There was no courtyard 
or solid roof below. We were com- 
ing down on the domed and trans- 
parent cover of a large workshop, 
a canopy made of what appeared 
to be glass panels held in a tangled 
web of rusty metal braces. We 
looked at it, horrified, as we rushed 
toward it. We were just not going 
to stop in time. 

It was lovely. Silent, secret at- 
tackers, flitting gray ghosts in the 
dawn we were not. Six pairs of 
boots hit at the same instant and 
about five thousand square meters 
of glass were kicked out. The sup- 
porting framework twanged and 
bent and some of the rusty supports 
snapped free. For one shuddering 



instant I thought we were going to 
follow all the glass that was now 
crashing and clashing into the 
chamber below with a hideously 
loud cacophony- Then the grav- 
chute gave its all with one shudder- 
ing last blaze of energy, halting our 
forward motion. 

Then it burst into flame. 

“Grab the supports,” I shouted, 
tearing at the clamps that held the 
grav-chute to our harness. They 
resisted, searing my hand, but 
finally the chute dropped free. It 
fell straight down into the hall 
with its screaming occupants be- 
low, where it promptly exploded. 
I sighed and dropped some smoke 
and flare bombs to add to the 
confusion. 

“Our presence is now known,” I 
said, inching back toward safety. 
“I suggest we get off this pre- 
carious jungle gym and back on 
the job.” 

Moving carefully, sending more 
glass crashing down as our weight 
bent frames and panes slipped 
free, we crept back to the relative 
safety of the parapet. 

I paused for a second. 

“Get on the radio,” I told Diyan 
as he climbed up next to me. “Tell 
your troops to pull back their at- 
tack if they haven’t broken in, 
but to keep up the firing.” 

“They have been repulsed on all 
sides.” 

“Then tell them to cut their 
losses. We’ll do the blitz from the 
inside.”

IF 




W r E MOVED on, Angelina and 
I leading in order to blast any 
resistance that appeared, while 
the others protected our flanks and 
rear. We pushed forward at a 
sweaty trot. We had to move fast, 
sow discord as we went— and find 
He. The first door opened onto a 
great circular staircase that 
seemed to spiral down to infinity. 
I didn't like the looks of it so 1 
rolled some concussion grenades 
down it and we pressed on across 
the roof. 

“Where to?” Angelina asked. 
“That tangle of turrets and 
buildings up ahead seems to be 
larger and more functionar than 
most of this place— that seems as 
good a guess as any.” Something 
exploded on the tiles nearby and 
Angelina picked a sniper out of a 
window above with a sirigle snap- 
shot from the waist. We ran a bit 
faster, then pressed against the 
wall, above a straight drop to the 
valley below, while I blew out a 
locked door. Then we were in. 

The place had been designed by a 
madman. I know that is literally 
true, but you didn’t have to know 
He to get the message. We 
prowled corridors and stairs, 
twisted chambers, angled walls, 
even one spot where we had to 
crawl on our hands and knees 
under the low ceiling. This was 
where we had out first casualty. 
Five of us were clear of this room 
before the ceiling silently and 
swiftly descended and crushed the 



rear guard before he could even 
make a sound. We were all sweat- 
ing harder. The enemy we met were 
not armed for the most part and 
either fled or were dropped by our 
needle guns. All was speed and 
silence now— we moved as fast as 
we could between the bizarrely 
decorated walls,- finding it easy to 
avoid looking at the incredible 
paintings that seemed to cover 
every meter of available space. 

“Just one moment,” Angelina 
panted, pulling me to a stop as we 
came through a high archway to a 
staircase that spiraled out of sight 
below, each stone step a different 
height from the others. “Do you 
know where we are going?” 

“Not exactly,” I panted in re- 
turn. “We’re simply penetrating 
the establishment to get ahead of 
the fighting, while spreading a bit 
of confusion.” ^ 

“I thought we had bigger ambi- 
tions, like finding He.” 

“Any suggestions how we might 
go about that?” I am forced to ad- 
mit that I snapped a bit. Angelina 
responded with saccharine sweet- 
ness. 

“Why, yes. You might try turn- 
ing on the time-energy detector you 
have slung around your neck. I 
believe that is the reason we 
brought it.” 

“Just what I was going to do 
anyway,” I said, lying to conceal 
the fact that I had forgotten com- 
pletely about the device in the 
white heat of combat. 



THE STAINLESS STEEL RAT’S RETURN

The needle swung about and 
pointed with exact precision to the 
floor beneath our feet. 

“Down and down we go/’ I 
ordered. “Where the time helix 
coils — there will be found the He, 
whom I am about to make into 
mincemeat.’’ I meant every word — 
this was the third and last try. I 
had constructed a special bomb on 
which 1 had painted his name. It 
was a hellish mixture of a curdler 
— guaranteed to coagulate all 
protein within five meters— an 
explosive charge, a load of 
poisoned shrapnel and a thermite 
bomb to cook the curdled, coag- 
ulated, poisoned body of He. 

After this the fighting picked up. 
Some sort of flame-thrower below 
sent an impenetrable wave of 
roiling smoke and fire up the stairs . 
toward us. Singed and smoking, 
we crashed through a hole I 
blasted in the wall and. dropped 
into a laboratory of sorts. Row 
after row of bubbling retorts 
stretched away in all directions, 
hooked to a maze of crystal plumb- 
ing. Dark liquids dripped and 
valves hissed foul-smelling steam. 
The workers here were unarmed 
and they dropped before us. We 
were trotting more slowly now and 
gasping for breath. 

“Uggh!” Angelina said, making a 
twisted face. “Have you seen what 
is in those jars?” 

“No, and I don’t want to. Press 
on.’’ Anything that could bother 
my cool Angelina was something 



I had no desire to see at all. I was 
glad when we left this area behind 
and found another stairwell. 

W r E WERE getting close. 

Resistance began firming up 
and we had to battle most of the 
way now. Only the fact that the 
defenders were haphazardly armed 
allowed us to get through at all. 
Apparently most of the weapons 
were in use on the walls — these 
people came at us with knives, 
axes, lengths of metal. Screaming 
and frothing they rushed to the at- 
tack and slowed us just by the 
weight of their numbers. We had 
our next casualty when a man with 
a metal spike dropped from some 
cranny above and stabbed one of 
the Martians before I could shoot 
him. They died together and all we 
could do was leave them and push 
on. I took a quick look at my watch 
and broke into a tired trot again. 
We were running out of time. 

“Wait,’’ Diyan called out 
hoarsely. “The needle — it no longer 
points.’’ 

I waved everyone to a stop in a 
wide passage we were traversing 
and they dropped, covering the 
flanks. I looked at the time-energy 
detector that Diyan had been 
'carrying. 

“Which way was it pointing 
when you looked at it last?’’ 
“Straight ahead — down the cor- 
ridor. And there was no angle to 
the needle at aJI. The machine it 
pointed to must be on this level.’’

“It only works when the time 
helix is operating. The helix must 
be deactivated now.” 

“Could He have gone?” Angelina 
asked, speaking aloud the words I 
was trying to keep out of my 
thoughts. 

“Probably not,” I said with 
phony sincerity. “In any case, we 
have to push on as long as we can. 
One last effort now— dead ahead.” 

We pushed— and had another 
casualty when we attempted to 
cross a layer of writhing branches 
covered with thorns evidently 
tipped with poison. I finally had to 
burn out the stuff with our last 
thermite grenade. Ammunition 
and grenades were running short. 
A brisk firefight at the next cor- 
ridor junction emptied my needle 
gun. I tossed it aside and kicked 
the heavy door that barred further 
progress in this direction. 

It would have to be blown open 
and my grenades were exhausted. 
I turned to Angelina just as a 
communication plate next to the 
door lit up. 

“You have lost your final 
chance,” He said, grinning wicked- 
ly at me from the screen. 

“I’m always willing ta talk,’’ I 
said, then spoke to Angelina in a 
language I was sure He did not 
speak. Only she and I knew it. 
“Any concussion grenades left?” 

“I am talking — you will listen,” 
He said. 

“One,” Angelina told me. 

“I’m all ears,’* I said to him. 



“Take out that door,” I said to her. 

“I have dispatched all the people 
I need to a safe place in the past 
where we will never be found. I 
have sent the machines we will 
need, I have sent everything that 
will be needed to build a time 
helix as well. I am the last to go — 
and when I leave the time 
machinery will be destroyed behind 
me. 

The grenade exploded but the 
door was thick and remained stuck / 
in the frame. Angelina sprayed it 
with explosive bullets. He talked 
on as though nothing were happen- 
ing. 

“1 know who you are, little man 
from the future, and I know where 
you come from. Therefore I shall 
destroy you before you have a 
chance to be born. I will destroy 
you, my only enemy. Then the 
past and the future and all eternity 
will be mine — ” 

The door went down and I was 
the first one through. 

My bullets were exploding in the 
delicate machinery of the time 
helix as my He-bomb arched 
through the air. 

But he had already activated 
the time helix. Its green glow was 
gone — He was gone. My hell- 
bomb exploded in empty air and 
was more of a danger to us than to 
the vanished one it had been in- 
tended for. We dropped to the floor 
as death whizzed overhead and 
when we looked next the machinery 
in the room was dissolving.

He spoke again and the muzzle 
of my gun looked for him. 

“I made this recording in case 
I had to leave abruptly, so sorry.” 
He chuckled at his own bad humor. 
”1 have gone now — you cannot 
follow me but I can follow you 
through time. And destroy you. 
But you have other enemies with 
you and I wish them to feel my 
vengeance too. They will die. You 
will all die — everything will die. I 
control eternity, destroy worlds. I 
will destroy this Earth. I leave you 
only enough time to consider and 
suffer. You cannot escape. 

“In one hour every nuclear 
weapon on this planet will be 
triggered. Earth will be destroyed.” 

IV 

I ITTLE satisfaction was to be 
4 gained from blowing up the 
recording machine that had He’s 
hateful voice coiled in its guts but 
I did it anyway — one shot. The 
thing exploded in a cloud of plastic 
bits and electronic components 
and the insane laughter was cut off 
in mid-cackle. Angelina patted my 
hand. 

“You did your best,” she said. 
“But it wasn’t good enough. I’m 
sorry 1 got you involved in this.” 

“I wouldn’t want it any other 
way.” 

“This sounds like something very 
terrible will be done to your peo- 
ple,” Diyan said. “I am very sorry.” 
“Nothing to feel sorry about. 



We’re all in the same boat.” 

“In one sense, yes. But Mars is 
saved and we who die here know 
that we accomplished at least that 
much. Our families and our people 
will live on.” 

“I wish I could say the same,” I 
said with utmost gloom, borrowing 
his gun and picking off two of the 
enemy who tried to rush in through 
the broken door. “When we lost 
here we lost for all time. I’m sur- 
prised we are still around at all. 
We should have been snuffed out 
like candles.” 

“Isn’t there anything we can do?” 
Angelina asked. 

“Nothing I can think of. You 
can’t outrun H-bombs. The time- 
helix equipment is kind of melted 
so that escape is out. What we need 
is a new time helix, which we are 
not going to get unless one appears 
out of thin air.” 

In echo to my words there was 
the sudden crack of displaced air 
above. I rolled and ducked, think- 
ing the sound meant a new attack. 
It did not, A large green metal 
case "hung unsupported in mid-air. 
Angelina looked at me in the 
strangest manner possible. 

“If that is a time helix— you 
must tell me how you did it.” 

For once in my outspoken life I 
was silent, even more so when the 
box began to drift down before us 
and, just before it grounded, I read 
the lettering on the side. 

TIME HELIX— OPEN WITH CARE

IF 




I didn’t move. It all seemed too 
unbelievable. The two grav-chutes 
strapped to the top of the case, the 
timing device that had caused them 
to lower the whole thing to the 
floor, the small recording appa- 
ratus also fixed to the case with 
the boldly lettered words play me 
lettered across it. I boggled and 
gaped. It was ever-practical 
Angelina who stepped forward and 
pressed the starting button. Pro- 
fessor Coypu’s voice rolled out 
to us. 

“I suggest you get moving rather 
quickly. The bombs, you know, go 
off quite soon. I have been asked to 
tell you, Jim, that the bomb con- 
trol apparatus is concealed in a 
cabinet on the far wall behind the 
dehydrated rations. It has been 
disguised to look like a portable 
radio because it really is a portable 
radio. With additions. If mishan- 
dled it will set all the bombs off 
instantly. Which would be uncom- 
fortable. You are to set the three 
dials to the digits six-six-six, 
forming, I belipve, the number of 
the beast. Set them in sequence 
from right to left. When they have 
been set press the off button. Now 
turn me off until you have done 
that. Be quick about it.” 

“All right, all right,” I said, 
irritated, and switched him off. He 
had quite a commanding tone for 
an individual who wouldn’t be born 
for another ten thousand years or 
so. And how come he knew so 
much? I complained, but I went 



and did the job, hurling the dehy- 
drated rations to the floor where 
they obviously belonged. They 
looked like lengths of yellowish- 
green desiccated octopus tentacles. 
Suckers and all. The radio was 
there. I did not attempt to move 
it, but set the dials as instructed 
and pressed the button. 

“Nothing happened,” I said. 

“Which is just the way we want 
it,” Angelina said, standing on 
tiptoe to give me an appreciative 
kiss on the cheek. “You have again 
saved the world.” 

F EELING proud of myself, I 
swaggered back to the recorder 
before the admiring gazes of the 
Martians and switched it on again. 

“Don’t think you have saved the 
world,” Coypu said. Party pooper. 
“You have merely averted its de- 
struction for approximately twenty- 
eight days. Once activated, the 
bombs wait that period, then self- 
destruct. But your Martian asso- 
ciates can profit from this delay. 
I believe they have supply ships 
on the way?” 

“Due in fifteen days,” Diyan 
said, hushed awe in his voice. 

“Fifteen days, more than enough 
time. Earth will be destroyed, but 
when its present condition is con- 
sidered this seems more a blessing 
than a tragedy. It is now time for 
you to open this case. On top of 
the controls is a molecular dis- 
rupter. If this is pointed at the 
outside wall — high up where the 



THE STAINLESS STEEL RAPS RETURN

small windows are — and angled 
down at fifteen degrees, it will cut 
a tunnel that will exit outside the 
walls. 1 suggest this be done as 
soon as possible. The Martians can 
get out that way. Now press button 
A and the time helix will form. 
James, Angelina, ^ strap on the 
grav-chutes and leave as soon as the 
ready light comes on.” 

Still partially unbelieving, 1 did 
as instructed. The time helix crack- 
led into existence and groaned 
and sparked as it'wound itself up. 
Diyan stepped forward, his' hand 
out to take mine. 

“We will never forget you and 
what you have done for our world. 
Generations yet unborn will read 
your name and accounts of your 
exploits in their schoolbooks.” 

“Are you sure you have the spel- 
ling right?” I asked. 

“You make light of this because 
you are a great and humble man.” 
That was the first time I had ever 
been accused of humility. Or of 
greatness, for that matter. “A 
statue will be erected with James 
diGriz, World Saver inscribed 
upon it.” 

Each Martian shook my hand 
in turn — it was very embarrassing. 
There was an admiring gleam in 
Angelina’s eye as well, but women 
are simple creatures and enjoy 
basking even in reflected attention. 
Then the ready iight came on and, 
after a few more goodbyes, we put 
on the grav-chutes as directed and 
^for the last time I sincerely 



hoped — were bathed in the cool 
fire of the time force. Our contact 
must have triggered the apparatus 
because before I could make the 
very apropos remark that was on 
my lips everything went zoinng. 

T HE trip was no worse than 
any other, certainly no better. 
This was one kind of transporta- 
tion I would never get adjusted to. 
Stars like speeding bullets, spiral 
galaxies whirling around like fire- 
works, movement that was no 
movement, time that was no time — 
we witnessed all the usual phe- 
nomena. The only feature that was 
good about the trip was its ending 
in the gymnasium of the Special 
Corps base, the largest open 
chamber there. We floated in mid- 
air, my Angelina and I, smiling 
madly at each other and oblivious 
to the cries of amazement from the 
sweating athletes below. We held 
hands in the simple happiness of 
knowledge that the future still lay 
ahead of us. 

“Welcome home,” she said. 
We floated down, waving to our 
friends and ignoring their questions 
for the moment. Coypu and the 
time lab came first — we had to 
report. I knew a quick feeling of 
unhappiness that He had escaped 
me and hoped that the next time 
he was tracked down a few very 
large bombs could be sent in my 
place. 

Coypu looked up and gaped. 
“What are you doing here?” he 



100 



IF 




said. “You are supposed to be 
eliminating this He person. Didn’t 
you get my message?” 

“Message?” I asked. 

“Yes. We made ten thousand 
metal cubes and sent them back to 
Earth. Sure you would get one of 
them. Radio direction and such.” 
“Oh, that old message. Received 
and acted upon, but you are a little 
out of date. What is that doing 
here?” I’m afraid my voice rose a 
bit on this last as I pointed with 
vibrating finger at the compact 
machine across the room. 

“That? Our Mark One compact 
folding time helix? What else 
should it be doing? We have just 
finished it.” 

“You’ve never used it?” 

“Never.” 

“Well you are going to use it 
now. You have to strap a couple of 
grav-chutes to it — here, use these 
— and a recorder and a molecular 
disrupter and shoot it right back 
to save Angelina and me.” 

“I have a pocket recorder, but 
why — ” He took a familiar-looking 
machine from his lab coat. 

“Do it first — explanations can 
come later. Angelina and I are 
about to be blown up if you don’t 
do this right.” 

I grabbed some paint and wrote 
play me on the recorder, then 

TIME HELIX — OPEN WITH CARE on 

the machine. The exact moment 
when He had left Earth was deter- 
mined by the time-tracer and the 
arrival for this cargo set for a few 



minutes later on the big helix. 
Coypu dictated the tape under 
my instruction and it wasn’t until 
the whole bundle was whisked 
back into the past that I heaved 
a grateful sigh of relief. 

“We are saved,” I said. “Now 
for that drink you promised me.” 
“I didn’t promise— ” 

“I’ll have it anyway.” 

C OYPU was muttering to him- 
self and scratching on a pad 
while I prepared some hefty drinks 
for Angelina and myself. We 
clunked glasses and were baptizing 
our throats when he came over. 

“I needed that,” I said. “It must 
be ages since I last had a drink.” 
“It is all coming clear at last,” 
Coypu said. 

“Is it all right if we sit while we 
listen? It’s been a busy couple of 
hundred thousand years.” 

“Yes, by all means. Let me re- 
trace the course of events. A time 
attack was launched upon the 
Corps by He, a most successful 
assault. Our numbers were quite 
reduced — ” 

“Yes, like down to two. You and 
me. 

“Quite right. Though as soon as 
I had dispatched you to the year 
nineteen seventy-five I found that 
all things were as they had been. 
They reverted most suddenly. I 
was all alone one instant— then the 
laboratory was full of people who 
never knew they had been gone. We 
put in a lot of work on improving 



THE STAINLESS STEEL RAT’S RETURN 



101 




the time-tracking techniques — 
took us almost four years to get 
things the way we wanted.” 

“Did you say four years?” 

“Nearer five before we got it 
operational. The trails were distant 
and hard to follow, most tangled 
as well.” 

“Angelina!” I cried with sudden 
realization. “You never told me 
you had been here alone for five 
years.” 

“I didn’t think you liked older 
women.” 

“1 love them as long as they are 
you. You were lonely?” 

“Hideously. Which is why I vol- 
unteered to go after you. Inskipp 
had another volunteer but he broke 
his leg.” 

“My darling— I bet I know how 
that happened—” 

She is not the blushing type but 
she did lower her eyes. 

“We are getting ahead in* se- 
quence.” Coypu said. “But that is 
what happened. We traced you 
from nineteen seventy-five to eigh- 
teen-oh-seven — and traced He and 
his minions as well. There was a 
loop in time there, an anomaly of 
some kind that eventually sealed 
itself off. We could tell^ that it was 
to collapse with you sealed inside 
it and succeeded at last in forcing 
enough power into the helix to 
penetrate the sealed loop just be- 
fore it went down. That was when 
Angelina went back with the coor- 
dinates for your next skip in time, 
the long twenty-thousand-year 



jump after He. You had to go after 
him because the time paths were 
there to prove that you had fol- 
lowed him. Though, of course, 
history was clear by then and we 
knew how it would all end.” 

“You knew?” I asked, feeling 1 
had missed the point somewhere. 

“Of course. The entire nature of 
the attack was clear, though you 
all, of course, h^td to fulfill your 
destined roles.” 

“Could you spell it out again? 
And slowly.” 

“Of course. You managed to 
destroy He’s operation twice in 
the remote past and eventually 
reset his machine and sent him 
forward to the twilight day$ of 
Earth. Here he spent an immense 
amount of time, almost two hun- 
dred years, climbing to power and 
uniting all the planet’s resources. 
He was a genius, albeit a mad one, 
and could do this. He also remem- 
bered you, Jim — fading memories 
and half insane ones after two 
hundred years, but he remembered 
enough to know you were the en- 
emy. Therefore he launched a time 
- war to destroy you before you 
could destroy him, trapping you as 
he thought on a planet about to 
be destroyed by atomic explosion. 
From there he returned to 1975 to 
attack the Corps. You came after 
hiql and he fled to 1807 to lay the 
time loop trap for him. I don’t 
know where he planned to go from 
there but his plans appear to have 
been altered and he went instead

twenty thousand years ahead.” 

“I did that, altered the setting 
on his machine just before he left.” 
“That is all there is to it. We can 
relax now that it is over and I do 
believe I’ll join you in that drink.” 
“Relax?” The word came from 
my throat with a singularly nasty 
grating sound. “From what you 
have said it sounds as if I started 
the whole attack on the Special 
Corps by altering the setting on 
the time helix that sent He to the 
world where he launched his cam- 
paign to destroy the Corps.” 
“That’s one way of looking at it.” 

«TS THERE any other? The 
A way I see it, He just bounces 
in a circle in time forever. Running 
from me, chasing me, running 
from me . Damn! When was he 
bom? Where does he come from?” 
“Those terms are meaningless 
in this sort of temporal relation- 
ship. He exists only within this time 
loop. If you wish to say it, though 
it is most imprecise, it would be 
fair to say that he never was born. 
The situation exists apart from 
time as we normally know it. As 
does the fact that you returned here 
with the information to be sent 
to yourself about the settings on 
the atomic bombs to enable you 
to return here to inform yourself 
about the settings on the bombs in 
order — ” 

“Enough!” I groaned, reaching 
for the bottle with trembling hand. 
“Just mark the mission as being 



accomplished and put me in for a 
fat bonus. To think that I gave up 
the occupation of an honest thief 
to become involved in this sort 
of thing.” 

“Thief is the correct word,” a 
nauseatingly familiar voice cried 
out. “And crook, con man, black- 
mailer, briber and more.” Inskipp 
stood in the doorway waving his 
florid face and a sheaf of papers 
in my direction. “Five years I have 
been waiting for you, diGriz, and 
this time you are not getting away. 
No excuses like timje wars now. 
You crook, you steal from your 
buddies, urggh!” 

He said, Urggh! because Angel- 
ina had popped a sleep capsule 
under his nose. He folded gently 
to the floor. She grabbed the sheaf 
of papers, then took me by the arm. 

“After five years I need you 
more than that nasty old man does. 
Let’s bum this file and steal a ship 
before he comes to. It will be 
months before he can find us and by 
that time something else will have 
come up and he will need us to 
work again. We can have a lovely 
crooked honeymoon.” 

“Wonderful! Here’s to crime!” 
“Here’s to time,” Coypu said, 
getting in the spirit of the thing. 

We shouted our toasts together, 
broke our glasses against the wall, 
jumped lightly over Inskipp’s 
snoring body and were out the door. 

It’s a bright, glorious universe 
out there and we intend to enjoy 
all of it. • 



THE STAINLESS STEEL RAT’S RETURN 



103 





104 





W ILLIAM’S small tractor- 
mounted probe had checked 
the atmosphere. It was similar 
to Earth’s. The radiation levels, 
were high but safe. The surface 
was cool and firm. The climate 
was temperate. The probe had also 
found the source of the signals. The 
cameras were pointed directly at 
it. The signals came from a saucer- 
like object, a domed thing with a 
port in it. The port was open. The 
probe’s antennas were right on it. 
The steady, weak, primitive signal 
continued. 

In stationary orbit high over the 
moving planetoid, Williams was 
at the controls of his ship, the HG. 
He and the Russian, Mareshefsky, 
watched the control room screens 
as Bella locked herself into the 
HG’s Lander and then separated 
from the mother ship for the quick 
flight down. 

Their probe on the planetoid’s 
surface picked up the Lander’s 
touchdown. The white of the man- 
made Lander was another con- 
firmation that the colors Williams 
and Mareshefsky saw on the HG’s 
screens were true. The intensity of 
the color was almost blinding. The 
sea’s redness was topped with 
whitecaps. The beach, if it was a 
beach, wore purple colors. The 
vegetation, bushes, grass, even the 
few stunted trees were all in blue 
tones and the mountains, high and 



sharply cut, displayed a fury of 
multiple color, as if a child had 
gone mad with a crayon box. 

Williams reached forward and 
switched on another screen. The 
Earth Interplanetary Enforcers 
were still patrolling. They were 
protecting the life form on the 
planetoid. The HG’s screens 
showed they were still focused on 
the decoy. If they changed their 
focus Williams knew that he would 
be in a race for his life. The 
Enforcers had orders to blast him 
out of the sky. If they caught him, 
they’d blast him. 

Mareshefsky watched Williams. 
It was not easy for him to admit 
that Williams was the master 
hunter. Earth’s zoos held more 
monsters that Williams had 
brought back alive from space than 
had been captured by all the other 
hunters combined. 

“I’m opening now,” came Bella’s 
voice from the planetoid, clear, 
sweet, true. The steady and con- 
tinuous background signal from 
the domed saucer was on minimal 
amplification on the same 
frequency. 

Williams turned a switching gear 
to focus his probe’s cameras on 
the Lander. Mareshefsky stood up 
to look as the Lander’s port 
slowly dropped open. When it was 
down, still there was no movement. 

“One hour from now, yes?” 



ONE AND ONE ARE TWO 



105 




-Bella asked, checking her time. 

“Yes,” Williams answered. 

“I’ll increase the wager. I’ll get 
it within twenty minutes,” her 
voice said. “I’ll double my bet on 
that.” 

“Not for me,” Williams said. 

“I accept you,” Mareshefsky 
told her. 

“Good. It’ll be too easy,” she 
said. And then they saw her on their 
screens. After the probe’s check of 
the atmosphere Williams had said 
he still would use breathing ap- 
paratus and a suit, but Bella had 
insisted on using nothing. She came 
into full focus on the HG’s screens. 
Her form-fitting one-piece suit 
looked as stylish as anything on the 
most fashionable street on Earth. 
She was a stunningly made, beauti- 
ful woman. Her hair blew in the 
wind of the planetoid and somehow 
with that the menace seemed to be 
less. It was easy to forget that the 
on-the-job mortality rate among 
hunters was close to one hundred 
percent. The hunters who survived 
at any given time were as ruthless 
and vicious as the do-gooders and 
the Protectionists on Earth claimed 
they were. 

Williams thought she was a fool 
and fools bored him. To go down 
to try to capture whatever was on 
the planetoid was an occupational 
lunacy — but to do it as if you were 
going to a style show was so stupid 



that it embarrassed him. If she was 
going down to seduce whatever was 
in the thing or on it, she was 
dressed for it. But in the light of his 
memories of the monstrous beings 
that lived and grew in space she was 
mad, Williams thought. 

F IT he watched carefully and 
professionally as she climbed 
down, faced the probe’s cameras 
and smiled brilliantly. She was 
corrupt, she was rotten, she was as 
loathsome as Mareshefsky was— 
as he himself was — and yet, seeing 
her standing there, he had to admit 
that she looked like an angel. 

“Everything’s quiet,” Bella 
said. “There’s a strong wind — an 
Earth feel to it. With it and the 
temperature it is like a spring day. 
The colors are, extreme. We were 
wrong about them. They are far 
beyond the range and values of 
your cameras.” She walked a few 
steps. “There’s a feeling of artifi- 
ciality. I don’t know why. I just 
suddenly felt that. The surface is 
firm — but strange. It has an almost 
papier-mache feeling underfoot. 
But I see no imprint in it, not my 
footprints and not anyone else’s 
or any thing’s.” 

A honking noise came from the 
audio system. 

Williams said, “The horn.” 

“I just let out the horn sounds,” 
Bella said from the planetoid.

IF 




“No response. Not yet. The 
environment gives me a strong 
feeling that this place is unin- 
habited. I feel that I’m the first. 
But I have an intuitive unease. I 
feel threatened.” 

They watched her walk around, 
the probe and the Lander managing 
fully to cover her through their 
cameras. Williams frequently 
checked out to the Enforcer ships. 
If the Enforcers came the under- 
standing was that whichever of 
the three hunters was on the 
planetoid would be abandoned. 
But there was no threat from that 
quarter — not yet. 

“I see nothing but the dome. 
It’s a dome, though, on a saucerlike 
object. I don’t think you can see it 
on your screens, but there’s a clear 
material, a plastic or glass, a pod 
that it’s standing on. From here I 
see no light emanations. My heat 
detector shows specific warmth in 
the interior. Clearly no damage 
visible. There’s no suggestion of a 
crash landing. Ah, there’s some- 
thing — an insignia right by the 
door. Can you get a closeup of it? 
From here it seems a diamond 
shape with forms — calligraphic 
forms — inside. It isn’t a natural 
phenomenon. It couldn’t be. I 
don’t think it is. I’m letting the 
horn go again, on the high 
frequencies.” 

Williams moved the lumbering. 



probe to a spot closer to her. It 
got a front view and through her 
thin clothing it was possible to see 
that she was aroused, excited. 

“No response,” she said. “There 
seems a complete seal. Only this 
one port. No visible exhausts. No 
moving parts. The radiation level 
is high, extremely high.” 

The two men in the HG watched. 

“Sorry,” Bella said. “I was just 
thinking. There doesn’t seem any 
alternative. I have to go aboard it. 
I feel slight panic. I’m glad I don’t 
have on a suit. I feel bound up 
enough as it is. I have to admit that 
right at the end, right before con- 
frontation, 1 always am terrified. 
I always feel like vomiting. I’m 
adjusting my weapon to maximum. 
If anything is in there and comes 
at me I’m not going to take a 
chance on trying to reason with it.” 

“It’s a hell of a thing,” she said, 
just an exclamation. “Look. Next 
time we do this, let’s use a drag 
antenna. Who knows whether 
our radio signals will come out of 
the thing. Sorry. That was me 
swallowing. I confess that I feel 
absolute foreboding and terror. I 
feel the way I felt when I was a 
child and had to perform or recite. 
How did I ever get here? What am 
I doing here? “Well, it is my game. 
I’m going in.” 

They watched her lift her foot 
and touch the domed saucer’s

ramp. “Lucky,” she said. “First 
step. No bolts of energy have 
charged through me. From here, 
by the way, I’d say the material is 
definitely a ceramic. Okay. Next 
step. It’s not possible to see any- 
thing inside. It’s just darkness. 
Wait! Now I can. There’s a flame 
or light in there. Nothing else. It 
doesn’t seem to illuminate any- 
thing. Just a flame, a bottled 
flame. I don’t know what it is. 

“I’m at the top now. Can you 
see me? I guess I can’t stall. I’m 
going in. Nothing except that 
flame. Well, here goes nothing. 
I’m now—” 

W ILLIAMS checked the 
Enforcers’ position and then 
broadened the focus of the probe’s 
cameras on the domed saucer. They 
waited. 

“Use a drag antenna if you go 
down,” Williams said. 

“Yes,” Mareshefsky said. 
“Twenty seconds.” 

Williams looked at the big 
Russian hunter and then they both 
looked at the screens, waited, 
watched. 

“One minute. She must see 
something in it.” 

“Maybe,” Williams said. 

The digital clocks clicked off the 
time. 

“I’m afraid of nothing, you 
know.” 



“Oh,” Williams said. 

“Ninety seconds. But now I have 
a tightening in my chest. What is 
happening down there?” 

Williams looked at the screen. 
Nothing seemed to be happening. 
The blue grasses were blowing in 
the wind — the red sea was whipping 
up more whitecaps. The white 
saucer was just sitting there. 

‘Two minutes. A long time.” 

They kept watching. 

“Five minutes,” Mareshefsky 
read the clock. 

“Start counting to the Lander’s 
liftoff now.” 

“You think she’s not returning.” 

Williams said nothing. 

Mareshefsky watched the clocks, 
sometimes recited the figures. 
Williams went on playing his 
chess game with the computer. 

“Five minutes to the Lander V 
liftoff,” Mareshefsky said. 

Williams moved his King out 
of check and then reached over 
and turned down a volume control. 
The microphonic pickups on both 
the probe and the Lander sent the 
sound of the Lander’s horns and 
then its mechanical voice up to the 
HG. Four minutes , thirty seconds 
to liftoff. Mark. And then came 
the interminable sighing of the 
lonely wind for thirty seconds and 
then the new time. Every thirty 
seconds the voice spoke. And then 
it was time.

“Liftoff,” Mareshefsky said. 

Williams had raised his eyes to 
watch it. The propulsion didn’t 
kick up dust or debris. He checked 
the monitor board and saw that the 
Lander was returning with no 
problem. 

He turned to look at 
Mareshefsky. “You want your 
turn?” 

“Is it possible to put the probe 
aboard the saucer?’’ 

“That’s reasonable.” Williams 
swung his chair around and 
reached forward to activate the 
probe. He set it off, the tractor 
tread slowly spinning to turn it, 
and then he moved it across the 
space and then up onto the ramp 
and slowly up it. 

“Now we see,” Mareshefsky 
said. 

Williams held the probe right at 
the top of the ramp and they 
looked in by way of the little 
probe’s cameras. All they saw was 
the flame. 

“If anyone is inside, please come 
out,’’ Williams spoke in English 
through his microphone. The echo 
of his voice came back from the 
probe. 

To Mareshefsky, he said, “I’m 
going to try to run it in and put an 
automatic withdrawal on it. Ready. 
Now.’’ 

The probe moved in. The screens 
went dead. 



M areshefsky came into 

the control room of the HG. 
Williams was still playing chess, 
infrequently watching the Enforcer 
ships, still receiving the constant, 
steady and unchanging signal from 
the domed saucer on the planetoid. 
Williams must have heard the 
Russian enter, but he didn’t 
acknowledge the man. 

Finally Mareshefsky said, “I 
think I will go down now.’’ 

“An hour? Or you want longer?’’ 
“An hour should be enough.” 
Williams reached out his hand 
and readjusted the timers, the 
entire cycling of the Lander. 

“I can offer you another probe. 
There are weapons, quite an as- 
sortment in there. Or free advice,” 
Williams said, clearly not involved, 
moving his queen to check the 
computer. 

“I like you, Williams. For these 
years, as you have beaten me 
again and again, I haven’t thought 
well of you. But now, actually 
being "with you, I like you. You 
really don’t care. You don’t care 
about Bella. You don’t care about 
the Enforcers. You don’t care 
about yourself.” 

“You’re wrong. I care. I’ll even 
suggest you give up. Don’t go down 
there. It’s not worth it.” 

“You would lie if I asked, but 
I will tell you, Williams. If it 
happens that I do not come back —

my friend, you will take your turn. 
I am a gambler and you are one and 
I tell you that you will take your 
turn. It is a thing that we do. And I 
do not want your advice or your 
weapons or your anything else. 
If I am a hunter, l am one. If my 
hunting is not good enough then 
I’ll get what I deserve.” 

“If we got what we deserved we 
all would have been struck down 
in our infancy.” 

“Are you troubled about what 
we’ve done? Think if it happened 
to men. A few taken away, thrown 
into their zoos. Who would give a 
damn? And as far as wiping out life 
on planets by being too casual 
about antibacterial checks, we’ve 
all done it. It has no importance. 
The whole of space is filled, 
crowded with things. We’re not big 
enough to dent it. There’s nothing 
we could do that would rate being 
recorded in a Universal history, 
no act, no crime, nothing.” 
Williams shrugged. 

“Luck,” he said. 

“I will use a drag aiUenna for 
you.” 

“If it won’t get in your way.” 

“It is nothing. If I return success- 
fully we will go ahead with the 
partnership?” 

“Why not?” 

“Williams,” the big Russian said 
as a farewell. 

“Mareshefsky.” 



Williams didn’t even watch, not - 
until the Lander touched down. * 
Then he sat back, put up his feet 
and studied the screens. Nothing , 
had changed. The screen was filled 
with the damned domed saucer or i 
whatever it was. The surface of the i 
planetoid was unchanged, nothing 
had moved. The moving body N 
the planetoid, of whatever material, 
was constantly facing the Earth’s ; 
sun. The light fell at a slight angle 
on the dome, but there was fully 
adequate illumination. 

“I’m down now. There is little 
to say. I’m standing on it. It is 
exactly as Bella said. Colors are 
very extreme. I would say that 
you’d be impressed by the moun- 
tains. Their height is consider- 
able. And the sea, the sea is a red 
ocean building up to a storm. Very 
well. Williams, if the Enforcers 
come at you, know that I would 
not mind finishing here. It is not 
unpleasant. It has a calm feeling to 
it. “I’m now facing the saucer. 
It is definitely a ship, perhaps made 
by a molding process. I’ve never 
seen the material. Call it a porous 
ceramic — a semiporous ceramic. 
My guess would be magnetic- or 
beam-powered. No moving parts 
visible and no concession to 
aeronautic considerations. An 
incongruity with this atmosphere.” 

“Why isn’t it a dwelling?” 
Williams asked. 



no 



IF 




“Why would it be?” Mareshefsky 
answered. “It has the feeling of a 
ship. 

“Bella, Bella,” Mareshefsky 
called. Williams turned up the 
radio from the Lander's pickup. 
“Nothing. I’m calling but there 
is no response.” He was quiet 
again, just walking around the 
thing, trying to tempt whatever 
was inside to make a move. “What 
the hell can it be?” he muttered. 

“I say give it up. There are a lot 
more you can get easier. Let the 
Enforcers get it or not get it.” 

“I couldn’t rest. What is it? 
Space is a bore. This is a mystery. 
I think I will go aboard now.” 
“Take a shot at it. You may stun 
whatever’s in the thing.” 

“An idea. But if Bella is in 
there—” 

“Forget Bella,” Williams said. 
“I’m now on the ramp. The 
antenna is with me. The wind sud- 
denly has picked up. There’s a 
howling sound to it. But it’s all 



right. Good. I almost slipped. 
There’s a dark slippery substance 
at the top of the ramp.” 

On the HG Williams watched as 
Mareshefsky drew his weapon. 

“I’m right at the entrance now. 
I can see in clearly. It is exactly as 
we saw it. A light, perhaps nothing 
more than an 1 incandescent bulb. 
Not clear. For a moment I thought 
I almost saw a movement in the 
upper part of the craft, a con- 
vulsive move. I couldn’t feel any- 
thing here. You can hear me. I will 
just put my head in. NW I am—” 
The voice stopped. Williams 
watched the Russian fall forward 
into the domed saucer. 
“Mareshefsky?” Williams called. 
There was no answer, only the 
continuing ping, ping, ping-ping — , 
ping, ping-ping from the domed 
saucer’s transmitter. 

Williams reached over and put 
the Lander’s television lens on full 
power. He could read made in 
japan on the sole of the

Russian’s shoe. 

“Mareshefsky!” 

Steadily, without being able to 
see anything inside the domed 
saucer, Williams watched as 
Mareshefsky’s body was slowly 
dragged inside. 

“Mareshefsky!” Williams called. 

He waited and watched. He 
didn’t recall the Lander. He let it 
spend its full time on the 
planetoid’s surface. But when the 
one hour was over he didn’t allow 
any more. As soon as it returned 
to the HG, Williams secured it. He 
secured the HG. He programed it 
for the return to Mars, for the long 
swing around to Earth. He hesi- 
tated for a moment and then 
moved his finger to press the but- 
tons that would start the return 
journey. 

He couldn’t do it. He argued and 
damned and cursed himself, but he 
just couldn’t do it. 

He had to go down. He got his 
suit, attached the equipment he 
always used. After each move he 
paused to call himself a dirty 
name. He was the worst damn 
fool. Why did he have to go? He 
didn’t need whatever was down 
there. He didn’t need the money. 
He didn’t need the credit. Why 
couldn’t he just let it go? 

But he couldn’t. Even as he 
climbed into the Lander and care- 
fully set everything to full manual 



control he fought with himself. 
But he released from the HG and 
he went down. No magic or 
romanticism drove him. He felt 
no force, no obligation, no loyalty. 
He was going down because he was 
a fool. He couldn’t resist the chal- 
lenge. He had to find out what the 
damned thing was. 

He put the Lander down just 
behind the domed saucer, not in 
front where the others had come in. 

As soon as he put his foot on the 
surface of the planetoid he let 
loose with a blast from his weapon 
and then he did it five more times. 
Then he walked up to the saucer, 
turned his blaster high and blew a 
part of the pod apart. There was 
a sharp crack, a shrieking sound. 
The thing tottered and swayed to 
one side. Williams walked around 
to the port side. He turned his 
blaster at the port and he fired into 
it. He walked up the twisted but 
otherwise intact ramp and saw the 
lamp inside and he blasted that. 

And then he walked into the 
saucer, the dome. 

The planetoid kept moving. It 
moved beyond the concern of the 
Enforcers, of the do-gooders on 
Earth. It moved out into deeper 
space sending its radio invitation to 
anyone who would listen. One and 
one are two. One and one are two. 
Ping , Ping, ping— ping. 

It was still hungry. #

I T was spring again. April— and 
the vapor shield was pale new- 
apple green. A gnawing was in my 
flesh strips, sharp ache and longing 
tear— or many tears, maybe, at- 
tempting to bring my heart rain, 
trying to surface and soften my 
new-metal steel. The Stronghold 
air was all at once too thick, too 
hot, and it smelled like old brass 
doorknobs dropped in a trash-box 
blaze. Yes! Spring is that season! 
Caution is the word — iron control 
and bird-dogging of the mind are 
the strategy. Against betrayal, self- 
betrayal. And maybe I was not the 
only one. Maybe the other Strong- 
hold masters, too, were trembling 
in their innermost Cells of Author- 
ity, fighting a silent battle as the 
flesh strips writhed and remem- 
bered spring. 

“Assembly!” 1 shouted the word. 
I screamed the call. I thumbed the 
button that let loose Noisy-Din. 
“Emergency!” And they all came 
toggling as I had trained them to 
do, as they knew they must do, 
moving with shank’s mares of new- 
metal, the hinges and braces of 
speed. Our speed! Yes. They tended 
toward the Great Hall of Discus- 
sions with all the clank and hurry 
they owned, the multitude of the 
weapons men, the servants— just a 
few — and the couple or so mu- 
tants (little flesh bums dressed all 
in tin) 1 allowed at times in the 



Stronghold so that 1 might be 
amused. (Horrible soft mushy 
people inside their tin, the flesh 
bums; not at all the bright and 
shiny solid grace we Stronghold 
people are, taut and straight in our 
new-metal steel replacements, with 
just a few flesh strips holding our 
godfhood bound). 

While they “ran” toward the 
Great Hall of Discussions I left 
my hip-snuggie throne in the inner- 
most Room of Authority. 1 moved 
the same way they moved, tog- 
gling my hinges and braces to be 
there on time.- Yes, with our new- 
metal steel replacements, from the 
commonest churl to the King we 
have given up grace of animal 
movement in walking. But when 
we bang into a corner or fall to the 
floor in a misstep or when a piece 
of battle-flung metal catches us on 
a part we do not bruise or break. 
We do not bleed. The real world’s 
beatings we take now and just pay 
them a never-mind, as though those 
terrible hammers were in thick, 
soft velvet gloves. Yes. We win 
some and lose some. To defeat old 
enemy Time we bartered well for 
the long gains and paid the fee of 
the losses as we had to — as we cut 
our flesh selves down. 

They were all there waiting as I 
toggled onto the stage. The silence 
was that hushed respectful absence 
of any sound at all that benefits

the entrance of the King. They had 
to be ready to storm the gates of 
utter impossibility if I so hinted— 
and they knew it. But my request 
this time was mild, though not so 
mildly put. 1 was emotional. I let 
them know the wish of their gleam- 
ing King— I screamed it. But what 
I demanded should not have been 
a thing too hard to come by even 
at this late date. 

“Make me an acre!” I cried. 
“An acre of soil!” The looks of the 
weapons men and the servants were 
all of disbelief. “I would plant crops 
and cultivate, this softest of the 
spring months of the year. Some- 
thing deep in my flesh strips grows, 
unfolds, flowers and cries for hus- 
bandry at this year-time that was 
once verdant with newborn leaves 
and stems. But now in our great 
steel times "nothing is born, all is 
made. Only the vapor shield is live 
new-apple green — the rest is all 
cold steel. Ah, it is beautiful, the 
precision we’ve gained, the flowers 
all up in metal in their rows, the 
leaves all folding out ersatz and 
shiny as the great trees leap through 
the yard holes at the press of a 
switch. And the grass that comes is 
just-so green, a nice ever-last car- 
pet as chunks of the prearranged 
plastic tumble upside down! All 
this at the turn of a switch. But it 
leaves a somehow hunger deep in 
some empty wells. The flesh strips 



writhe and remember. So make me 
an acre of soil!” 

T HE looks of the weapons men 
and the servants continued all 
disbelief. Whispers marched 
through the room and a small stale 
ribbon of sighs went out. And fi- 
nally my head weapons man, Slag 
Morgbawn, dour and efficient, 
once himself a Stronghold master 
and a “replaced” man, his lone 
flesh strip alive now in a built-in 
pickle jar, spoke. 

“With all due respect to our 
chief,” he said, “and your station 
of merit and the fact that you are 
a kind of King — an acre of soil is 
about as possible just now as our 
handing you the sun nestled in a 
little bucket of ice. Not that we 
wouldn’t do it, if we could, Sire, 
you understand— hand you the sun, 
I mean, nestled in a little bucket 
of ice. But some things arejust not 
to be done, Sire, no matter' how 
keen the desire of the would-be 
doer. Or how shining great and 
honored the demander.” 

“An acre of soil!” I repeated my 
cry. “Excuses are for old-women 
warriors who exaggerate always 
the deed to be done. Are any old- 
women warriors present? Ah, I 
thought not. There are millions of 
acres of soil, many as close as the 
reach of our ever-last mechanized 
eyeballs. And one acre’s procure-

ment for me, your King, you com- 
pare with the sun riding a small 
bucket of ice and set at my feet? 
Break out the little blasters! Don't 
tell me the greatest Stronghold on 
Earth will boggle at such a tiny 
request as the need of a little plant- 
ing dirt for its master’s spring crop- 
ping. I know our soil now, for many 
sterilized reasons, is under a few 
feet of plastic and that on top of a 
goodly apron of concrete some- 
times laid on steel. Certainly we’ve 
hidden the soil after ‘they’ mined 
it, raped it, poisoned it, totally 
ravaged it for the things of ‘their’ 
greed. But break out the little 
portable blasters! I’m sure our 
great Stronghold — toward which 
all other Strongholds think in shud- 
der and shame, being so deeply in 
fear of us — can blast down a hill 
or two. We can penetrate those 
few feet of plastic, that concrete 
and, if need be, that bedrock of 
steel! Will we find soil to our lik- 
ing? Has the ransacked dirt come 
back after lying for years under its 
blanket of plastic, its comforter of 
concrete and, in some cases, its 
bundler of steel? Has the soil been 
cleansed? Has the sick Earth 
sweetened? Listen,” I said, pulling 
taut my leg uplifters to make me 
the tallest of the tall and pressing 
the* small neck button that would 
give my voice more shove, ‘‘if we 
ask doubting questions what will 



ever get done? Where will our des- 
tiny be? If we had never done more 
— wouldn’t we still be tail-tied to 
trees, hairy and dumb, meat- 
bodied, flesh-aped to nothing, not 
knowing? Break out the little blast- 
ers. Pulverize me a hill! But don’t 
blarn it. Don’t blow it to high skies 
and all winds— just make me an 
acre of soil!” 



S O THERE we were that apple- 
green April day preparing to 
war on a hill. All the kill-potential 
of Stronghold 10 could be em- 
ployed to expedite our task, if need 
should dictate an all-out war on the 
plastic mound. But I had given the 
order for little tag-along blasters, 
as seemed to fit the need. All my 
weapons men and their mechanical 
stale ribbon of doubting sighs 
would obey. Yes! 

Soon we were out in the field as 
if geared for war, riding our crawl- 
track transports with our portable 
weapons of ultimate destruction all 
to the sides and the rear and I felt 
more like a god than a King. (After 
all, how many Kings have created 
an acre of soil in an apple-green 
vapor month?) The logistics of the 
little blasters attack and all the 
attendant problems of invasion 
were handled ably by my weapons 
men headed, a little reluctantly I’m 
afraid, by Slag Morgbawn, the

most feared weapons man in all 
wide Moderan. I’m thinking he 
thought it a little beneath him to 
be planning attacks on a hill that 
had no purpose other than being 
hill. But perhaps the fierce and the 
mighty need some shame at times, 
a homely humbling little task to 
take them clear back to themselves 



and restore them to the realities. 

I carried a tiny sprig of spring- 
metal blooms and hummed a lilting 
tune as we pressed toward the hill. 
The tin and silver T>irds of Central

whooshing of their jets and blew

their sharp metal shrill. Ah, spring! 

We opened on the hill. We moved 
in close and let it have our shots. 
We cracked it wide! We crushed it 
down. We went through plastic, 
concrete and steel with penetrating 
blasts. In some ways it was like 
cracking and peeling some giant 
bird’s three-layered egg. What did 
we find inside the three-layered 

egg? 

Had rattlesnakes come back? 
Had buzzing death been imprisoned 
to live all that while in our little 
hill? Our instruments droned their 
warning and we moved away from 
the illness that spoke to us from the 
unwell soil. It was contaminated, 
ruined, still ailing. 

We moved against other hills. 
We blasted and cut them down. We 
moved in with our gauges and 
heard that awful drone. Hill after 
grim hill. Until very late in the 
afternoon my pride came loose and 
I stood up and shouted at the whole 
wide high mocking air and green 
heaven, “Two buckets of good soil! 
I’ll settle for two buckets of good 
soil!’’ 

Did a god somewhere hear? Well, 
what’s to believe about such things? 

They stood before me, two little 
flesh mutant-men, disfigured, all 
down-drooped in the shoulders and 
looking back-sprained, with gristle- 
meat faces and hands that must 
have been through a broil. But 



smiling. Smiling at the clown King 
now with his pride all on the 
ground. And offered two small 
buckets of soil, one from each man. 

Oh, God . 

So we went on home — all that 
kill potential now led by a King cut 
down to clown, carrying two pre- 
cious buckets of soil through the 
apple-green spring air as though 
they were jewel boxes filled full of 
diamonds in gold. (Don’t ask me 
where they got soil. Under some 
secret hill, out of some dark lost 
cranny, up from some deep-down 
well? Two buckets of pure uncon- 
taminated soil that just sat there 
and looked glum and quiet at all 
our instruments’ cajoling. Not a 
peep, not a tick was uttered when 
our gauges passed nearby or probed 
in deep to see if this soil would talk, 
speak of an illness.) 

Yes, I planted sunflowers that 
spring to grow the sun out of two 
buckets of sweet pure soil. They 
came up and flourished. In July 
they bloomed, high on the Strong- 
hold wall, two gold spots waving. 
Slag Morgbawn came to look one 
day in mid-July. He stood by my 
side high on the Stronghold wall, 
his lone flesh strip alive in its solu- 
tion in the built-in pickle jar, his 
manner dour, as always. 

I could not resist saying: “When 
your King seems to want the sun, 
just obey the orders, huh?” •

F ORTUNATELY for most sci- 
ence-fiction readers, Isaac Asi- 
mov has not only begun to write 
fiction again, but his older novels 
are being re-issued by Fawcett 
Crest books. Eight are currently 
available and the others will soon 
appear — all will carry a uniform 
price of 75$. 

Among those now on the stands 
is Pebble in the Sky , the first novel 
by Asimov — and still my favorite. 
This one uses time travel, telepathy 
and a number of other devices to 
define its point — an Earth that is 
despised by the great Trantorian 
Galactic Empire. A humble and el- 
derly tailor from 1950 finds himself 
involved in a war Earth has de- 
clared against the entire Empire 
and has his loyalty twisted and 
tested severely. It makes fora first- 



rate story — and for the discerning, 
suggests possibilities that were mys- 
teriously never used by the later 
Second Foundation— or were they? 

A novel that is much less known 
than it should be, unlike the first, 
is The End of Eternity. This deals 
with the masters of time, who can 
enter a time tube ndt only to ob- 
serve all time— but to busy them- 
selves with changing every era to 
suit their ideals of what should be. 
But for each change that is made, 
some trouble crops up to force 
them to redesign continually. They 
keep the inventions of each age, of 
course, even when they destroy the 
inventors — and they serve as the 
ultimate master race. 

Harlan is a man who has been 
brought into the time tube and edu- 
cated to be one of the changers of 



119 




what is beyond the exclusive world 
of the tube. But he falls for a girl 
from a period that he must change. 
She may exist after the change — 
but with another culture, another 
history and another personality to 
fit the newly altered age. She won’t 
be the woman he loves. Despite the 
rigid laws of his time mastership 
he removes her and tries to hide her 
in the far future, while he goes back 
to help find why the whole time- 
tube system is in grave danger — 
it may fail completely because the 
probability is that it will never be 
invented back in the past! 

Other writers have used the basic 
device, but I know of no one who 
has wrung as much out of it or has 
developed all the possibilities of 
paradox. The story is a romance 
with a surprise. It is also a twisted, 
convoluted puzzle — and it is a book 
no Asimov fan should fail to read. 

C LIFFORD D. SIMAK seems 
to have returned to the sci- 
ence-fiction fold. Most of his work 
during the last few years has been in 
fantasy. He has written of ghosts, 
goblins and Shakespeare; of rein- 
carnations of ancient superstitions 
and civil war heroes and of outright 
mysticism. But in his latest book, 
the feeling is again that of science 
fiction, though man’s beliefs and 
what may be true of them are still 
central to his theme. 



His A Choice of Gods (Putnam, 
$4.95) is somewhat reminiscent of 
the City series. Again we have most 
of mankind gone away, as was true 
at the end of the aforementioned 
series. Robots are taking care of 
the planet — the Indians have been 
left behind and are trying to be- 
come one with nature in the old 
ways, though with much better 
understanding through what they 
learned from their European con- 
querors. The story is slow-paced, 
filled with touches of nostalgia and 
pastoral longings — this may be 
either an asset or a liability, de- 
pending on the reader. I enjoyed 
the book. 

Basically, the situation is that 
mankind has suddenly and almost 
completely disappeared. Only a 
few awake one morning to find that 
most people have vanished — either 
through a miracle or by having 
been kidnaped, snatched into 
space by some mysterious force. 
A party gathered in one house is 
mysteriously untouched, and man’s 
survival must depend on them. 
Later they discover that a fewv 
bands of Indians have also sur- 
vived. The “whites” try to conserve 
western technology, but fail for 
want of numbers and specialized 
education. The “redskins” don’t 
even try; they feel this is a chance 
to take back their land and revert 
to the old ways that best fit them. 



120 



IF 




The robots try for a while to serve 
man, but there are too many of 
them. Some go off to build a mys- 
terious structure of their own. A 
few others move into a sort of 
monastery to study and extend the 
old faith of man. 

The human survivors soon dis- 
cover that their life-span has been 
extended to about five thousand 
years of excellent health. Later, 
when their numbers increase, they 
discover that they can “teleport” 
themselves to other worlds. All but 
two leave for the stars, though they 
can^till communicate with those on 
Earth who are preserving the old 
homestead. 

Eight thousand years after the 
vanishment, John, a far wanderer 
returns from the stars at about the 
same time an alien, resembling 
a “can of worms,” comes to Earth 
seeking a soul. John has found 
three worlds where the people — 
those who vanished — have been 
placed. The worlds are still in the 
state of technical science and hu- 
man aggression. John has also been 
made aware of a Principal, so dif- 
ferent from human beings that he 
can never call it good or evil, 
though he shuns it instinctively. 

Finally John and his companions 
learn that the people are returning 
in a scout ship, almost certainly to 
ravage and take over Earth again. 

Simak has woven much more 



worth saying than can be covered 
here. He has also spent a great deal 
of time developing the philosoph- 
ical attitudes of his people and 
robots— attitudes representing at 
least seven different cultural de- 
velopments. While these seem to 
slow up the story, they are all part 
of the threads necessary for the 
Final weaving of his resolution. 

The book is not for the blood- 
and-action readers. But in a quiet 
way it is a rich and good book. 



U rsula k. le guin has 

established herself as a fine 
craftsman and a good writer in both 
fantasy and science Fiction. Her 
novels that culminated in Left 
Hand of Darkness were superb 
science fiction with a heavy social 
structure. A novelet on cloning was 
excellent hard science and psychol- 
ogy. And her Earthsea novels have 
developed a fantasy world with 
consistency and logic. 

Now she seems to have turned to 
a different type of writing. The 
Lathe of Heaven (Scribners, $4.95) 
is a sort of “anything goes” science 
fantasy, laid in what may be the 
present, on Earth. It involves psi 
Vower and alternate futures for its 
basic gimmicks. Unlike anything 
else I can remember by her, this 
novel gives the feeling that it was 
planned as it grew, rather than 



READING ROOM 



121 




being carefully laid out in her mind 
before writing. This may well not 
be the case — when a reviewer dis- 
cusses a writer’s methods he’s usu- 
ally wrong. But the book gives that 
impression. 

George Orr is picked up as an 
addict after a horrible dream. He 
admits using more than his quota 
of drugs, but explains that he does 
not dare to sleep because he is 
afraid to dream. When he dreams 
hideous things happen — not only 
in his nightmares but in the “real” 
wbrld around him. He’s sent to a 
psychologist, whom he tells that his 
problem began when he made a 
relative vanish by dreaming of her 
removal. In the psychologist’s of- 
fice he changes a picture on the wall 
under hypnosis. The psychologist 
remembers how it was before — the 
first time anyone but Orr has re- 
membered that things weren’t al- 
ways the same. 

The psychologist decides to gain 
the ability for himself. He forces 
Orr to dream, deliberately manag- 
ing to get him to make changes. 

Orr tries to escape and dreams 
all the more. Now each change he 
makes in the environment produces 
a higher status for the psychologist 
— until he has absolute power over 
Orr. Meaning to escape, Orr 
dreams up a world where a holo- 
caustic war rages. He then has to 
unite mankind, thus creating a 



world where aliens are attacking. 
A third effort produces an alien 
invasion and finally the invading 
aliens are changed into misunder- 
stood— and ununderstandable — 

aliens who come to teach us the 
good life, whatever that is — and to 
run such things as second-hand 
shops. 

By now this very promising idea 
becomes murky. A girl who was 
helping Orr has come and gone, 
changed character and station and 
generally become so muddled in the 
reader’s mind that she is only a 
name. And the aliens, once intro- 
duced, seem impossible to get rid 
of — they give him help of a sort, 
but not much. The story has 
changed in midstream with the 
changes in the world until there 
seems no order to it. 

In the end, with wonder piled on 
wonder, the plot simply loses 
credibility. 

Unlimited fantasy has one in- 
herent danger — when anything can 
happen at any time nothing can 
happen that will create suspense. 
And after the first half of this book 
reading it becomes a mechanical 
chore. 



I SUPPOSE it is a mark of the 
acceptance of science fiction 
that our reference books are being 
taken out of the hands of fans and 



122 



IF 




published by professional reference 
organizations. But it seems to me 
that we’ve had too damned much 
acceptance and not enough under- 
standing by the late-comers. 

Some years ago Walter Cole 
brought out an index to anthologies 
that was a labor of love— it must 
have taken a great deal of time 
for which he could never hope to 
gain even minimal reward. It was a 
valuable book and despite a few 
trifling and inevitable errors, an 
accurate one. 

Now Frederick Siemon has 
brought forth Science Fiction Story 
Index, 1950-1968 (American Li- 
brary Association, no price given). 
In the first place, it is grossly mis- 
named. The MIT Indices have a 
right to call themselves by such a 
title — since they index stories. The 
Sietnon book indexes only works 
that have appeared in anthologies 
and collections; Siemon makes no 
distinction between the two types 
of books. And there is every mark 
of carelessness, disinterest in the 
field and disregard of accuracy. 

The sources for the book are not 
the original work. Instead, Siemon 
seems to have used the Cumulative 
Book Index as his source, checking 
the entries under Adult Science 
Fiction against the publishers, 
editors, etc., when they would 
answer specifically. He lists 64 
positive identifications out of 271 



in the CBI for 1948-52; then states 
that 46 are included here. There is 
no evidence that he has even looked 
at the books to see what was in 
them. 

The errors are sometimes ridic- 
ulous. For instance, under Fred- 
erik Pohl’s listing are given not 
only stories by him but also the 
titles of collections and antholo- 
gies he has edited — most of which 
do jiot contain any stories of his. In 
a few cases he is listed as editor — 
in others he is not. This is ignor- 
ance or carelessness, not a series of 
typographical errors. 

I can understand why the ALA 
wanted an index. But they would 
have done better to find a man to 
do it who was familiar with the 
field, who bad or could get the 
books indexed and who could tell 
the difference between an article 
and a story. It would also have 
helped to include somehow the 
different titles under which an 
anthology appeared, rather than 
have the indexer screen out such 
alternates. 

Calling Walter Cole: Please try 
to bring out an updated or later 
index. There is nothing yet to re- 
place your work — nothing that’s 
worth consulting. 

Don’t worry about the lack of a 
stated price on the Siemon book. 
Whatever it costs, it isn’t worth 
it. #

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 

BRON came out of a state of 
unconsciousness in a strange city 
on an unfamiliar planet , not know- 
ing his name or identity , with holo- 
caustic war raging around him. A 
voice in his head identified him as 
a Terran agent involved in Earth* s 
struggle with the Destroyers , an 
outlaw federation of planets once 
colonized by Earth. The voice 
directed him to safety through 
Destroyer lines , told him he was 
in the city of Ashur on the planet 
Onaris, under Destroyer attack. 

The voice belonged to a Special 
Assignments Group attached to 
the Stellar Commandos, an Earth 
military unit. It reached him 
through a minute electronic trans- 
fer link surgically implanted in 
his brain before he began his mis- 
sion. The link not only enabled the 
Group to reach him at any time and 
see and hear through his senses, 
but also gave it life and death pow- 
ers over him. The voice continued 
to brief him. His amnesia, caused 
by a concussion during the De- 
stroyer raid on Onaris, was com- 
plicated by the fact that, before 
starting on his mission, he had been 
hypno-conditioned to represent 
himself as a leading Onarian 
scientist, Syncretist ANDER 
HALTERN , whom the Destroyers 
were known to be looking for on 
the planet. - 

The voice in Brons head was 
sometimes that of J A Y CEE, an 



acid-tongued but attractive female 
commando; of DR. VEEDER, 
Group medical officer; and of GEN- 
ERAL ANANIAS, its military 
member. Under the Groups direc- 
tion Bron duly fell into the hands 
of the Destroyers and was taken 
aboard the enemy spacefleet*s 
flagship, commanded by the De- 
stroyers* leader CANA, who 
received him cordially, believing 
him to be Ander Haltern. Canas 
lieutenant, COLONEL MARTIN 
DAIQUIST, however, suspected 
Bron/ Haltern* s credentials and 
subjected him to a test. With the 
aid of the real Ander Haltern *s 
coaching through the transfer link, 
Bron easily passed the test and was 
given restricted freedom of the ship 
by Cana. 

As Canas ,, guest ** Bron/ Haltern 
witnessed— from space— the total 
destruction of Onaris by a 4t hell- 
burner** missile, whose arrival 
Cana had accurately anticipated. 
The event matched the Destroyers * 
reputation for planetary destruc- 
tion — Cana, however, disclaimed 
all responsibility. The hellburner 
missiles always followed Destroyer 
raids and were of unknown origin, 
accordng to Cana, and this last 
one had undoubtedly been intended 
to kill Ander Haltern— it had 
struck Onaris at exactly the spot 
where the Destroyers had seized 
Bron/Haltern. 

To prove - his innocence Cana 
invited Bron/Haltern, as a master 
syncretist and expert on the 44 pat- 



126 



IF 




terns of chaos* — which Canas 
own scientists had used to compute 
the arrival of the hellburner — to 
check all data available on the 
ship. Bron/Haltern did so and also 
used his freedom of the ship to 
compute the course of Canas fleet 
back to the Destroyers* baseworld 
— information Earth wanted and 
Bron transmitted to the Group via 
the transfer link. His activities , • 
however , reawakened Daiquist*s 
suspicions and he was transferred 
from the flagship to another vessel , 
the Tantalus — a former Terran 
laboratory ship long since captured 
by the Destroyers and now part of 
Canas fleet. 

Aboard the Tantalus Bron made 
a startling discovery — the ships 
entire instrumentation had been 
exactly reversed: dials read from 
right to left , etc. Checking back , 
Bron also found that the Tantalus 
had once been commanded by 
General Ananias , who had aban- 
doned her and presumably her crew 
in space . When he confronted 
Ananias with the information via 
the transfer link the latter tried to 
kill him. Jaycee saved Bron* s life. 

Under the coaching of the real 
Ander Haltern via the transfer link 
Bron/Haltern established himself 
as an expert on the patterns of 
chaos with Canas own expert , 
LAARIS, who now captained the 
Tantalus. Studying the patterns 
with Laaris t Bron learned that the 
Tantalus was doomed to destruc- 
tion via the same agency that de- 



molished Onaris — a finding that 
tended to support Canas theory 
that some mysterious force in the 
universe was determined to kill 
Bron. 

Of more immediate concern to 
Bron t however , were his growing 
suspicions of General Ananias and 
during a transfer-link conversation 
with Dr. Veeder t the medical mem- 
ber of the Group , Bron virtually 
accused Ananias of treason. 

X 

HAT? Veeder’s wrath ex- 
ploded like a bomb. How do 
you compute that? 

“I memorized the subspace co- 
ordinates I got in the cavity on the 
other ship. I’ve just rerun the 
transposition to real-space terms. 
There’s been no chance to consult 
the star catalogues yet, but I’d 
issue a written guarantee that the 
Destroyers’ destination isn’t within 
half a galaxy of Brick’s World. The 
sector’s all wrong, for a start.” 

Are you sure? 

“Deadly sure. Ananias not only 
switched coordinates on the way to 
GenStaff, but he must have had a 
separate set prepared in readiness. 
Which brings me to the point of 
this conversation. However you 
may defend it, your Control center 
is the weakest link in the whole 
chain. I started a mission to destroy 




PATTERNS OF CHAOS

the Destroyers, and I intend to go 
through with it. I have a scheme 
and I’m going to try it. Doc, don’t 
stand in my way.” 

Regardless of circumstantial 
evidence , Bron, you re still under 
orders. I admit the things you've 
told me need investigating , but 
you're to take no action unless I 
say so. Do you understand? 

“No. I think Ananias is using 
you for his own ends. Since I don’t 
know what those ends are I’m not 
willing to comply.” 

Don't take that attitude with me, 
Bron. We have ways of ensuring 
your cooperation. 

“Spool it. Doc! Don’t try to pres- 
sure me. I know the range of a bio- 
electronic transducer. It isn’t even 
planetary, let alone interstellar, no 
matter how good your pickup.” 
Meaning what? Veeder’s voice 
was sharp. 

“Meaning that for you to receive 
transmissions from me or for me 
to pick up from you, there has to be 
a local repeater amplifier some- 
where close. If I smashed that I’d 
be free from you until I came near 
the next repeater.” 

True, Bron, true. But you'd never 
find it — not in a million years. 
Don't you know how small we can 
make a repeater amplifier? 

“Yes,” said Bron. “It was just 
that knowledge that told me where 
it was. Now do I get my own way?” 



You're bluffing, Bron. Not in a 
million years — 

Bron fingered the crucifix hang- 
ing from the chain around his neck. 
He brought it up to where he could 
see the golden cross cradled in his 
palm. 

“Now do I get my own way?” 

This could earn you a Court 
Martial, Bron. You know the 
penalty for disobedience. 

“Doc, do you think that threat 
holds any terrors for me? Try 
calculating the odds against my 
surviving long enough to come to 
trial.” 

There was a long silence, broken 
only by the blood-rush static of the 
pulsars. 

All right, Bron. You win this 
round . We will watch and listen, 
but not interfere. Give me the 
information you have on the 
coordinates. 

“Here.” Bron scanned the figures 
rapidly for the benefit of the re- 
corders. “You can rerun your own 
computation if you want a cross- 
check. But you won’t get it to 
indicate Brick’s World. Don’t 
bother to send any ships either. By 
the time they get there, there’ll be 
nothing left for them to intercept.” 

I don't understand. You can't 
tackle a base world and a ^space- 
fleet single-handed. 

“Just watch and listen,” said 
Bron. “It’s no accident that the 



128 



IF 




Tantalus is heading for the end of 
a line in chaos." 

You know / cant accept that , 
Bron. I have to act on this 
information. 

“Please yourself — but the way I 
see it you’ll never make it in time." 

B RON returned to the pro- 
gramer and began to set up a 
new series of equations, occasion- 
ally interrogating the cosmological 
indices of the ship’s navigation 
computer when he needed further 
information. He worked now with- 
out attempting to conceal the in- 
put and readouts, knowing that 
other eyes were seeing what he 
saw, yet would be able to determine 
nothing without knowing his 
intention. 

Shortly Jaycee came back on- 
line. 

Dont know what you said to 
Doc , but he lit out of here like 
somebody put rockets in his after- 
burners. You know you arent 
goin to get away with this rebel- 
lion, you illegitimate worm. Til 
teach you not to cross me if I have 
to kill you in the process. 

"Get off my back, Jaycee. Didn’t 
Doc tell you to leave me alone?" 

He shouted to leave you alone 
officially . He didnt say anythin 
about my speakin. 

"If this is to be a poison-tongue 
session, I’d have preferred the 



punishment button." 

Youd have been better advised 
to do so, you abortive whelp of a 
sex-mad she-cow. How did you 
ever become so lucky as to forget 
me? 

"It’s a reward for good living." 

Jaycee nearly choked on the 
point. If you remembered what I 
remember, you wouldnt even joke 
about it. They dont make words 
to describe animals like you. 

Bron pulled the final readout 
from the printer and inspected it 
closely. Two doors from the chart- 
room he knew he would find Weap- 
onry Control. It was unlikely to be 
manned by the skeleton crew, 
especially in subspace, but he 
would receive no quarter if the 
crew suspected his intention. 
Whether he had unconsciously 
subvocalized enough of his thoughts 
to warn Jaycee of his intention he 
did not know, but he heard her 
catch her breath sharply as he 
moved out of the chartroom. 

The corridor was empty. Silently 
he slid along the wall, hoping that 
the door to Weaponry Control 
was not locked. It was not — 
probably an oversight during the 
recent exodus of technicians. He 
closed the door behind him and 
locked it securely. 

When he was sure he was able to 
work without detection, he turned 
his attention to the weapon con- 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS

trols. Even in their laterally in- 
verted state they felt familiar to 
him. His fingers were guided by a 
surfacing recollection of past 
weaponry studies he could not call 
to mind — yet they prompted fa- 
miliar reactions in an ever-increas- 
ing cascade. 

He knew then that his own mem- 
ory was breaking through the 
block as surely as the Haltern 
synthesis was slipping away. He 
ran a quick check on the state of the 
magazines and was thankful to 
find them in good order. No less 
than four unassembled Terran 
Nemesis hellburners, small in 
power compared with the cata- 
strophic engines that had torn 
Onaris apart, were waiting in the 
assembly ramps. All they needed 
was the armorers’ signal, which 
would bring together the compo- 
nents to form them into the in- 
credibly dangerous weapons they 
were. His fingers keyed the as- 
sembly sequence in such a short 
time that he knew he must once 
have been tutored by a master. 

T HE automatic transfer of the 
missiles from the ramps to the 
firing tubes would be the most 
dangerous part of the operation. 
In the singing flight of the subspace 
mode the movement of such a mass 
within the ship was unlikely to 
escape the notice of the crew. With 



this in mind Bron made sure that 
the flight program was completely 
set and that the missiles’ motors 
would fire immediately on entering 
the tubes. Any of his instructions 
could be countermanded from the 
bridge, but he was gambling on 
the fact that the missiles would be 
away before the crew could pin- 
point the precise nature of hist 
interference. 

When all was set he activated the 
hellburners, then thumbed every 
alarm and repeater button he 
could find in order to create a di- 
version. The result was the nearest 
approximation to complete con- 
fusion he had ever contrived. The 
multiple blasts of various alarms 
racked the ship with a cacophony 
of noises. Every corridor was lit 
by a multiplicity of action signs, 
and the call boards began to chime 
for an urgent remuster, for which 
the ship had no available crew. 

Remaining only long enough to 
assure himself that the hellburners 
were actually spaceborne, Bron 
headed back to the chartroom. 
Soon two of the crew appeared, 
searching for they knew not what 
order of disaster. They eyed Bron 
suspiciously, but went on hurriedly 
to locate the source of the furor 
some two doors away. Soon the 
urgency of the alarm systems 
faded and was followed by a peace- 
ful hiatus. Bron studied star maps

wearing an angelic expression and 
listening to Jaycee alternately 
cursing and bitching inside his 
head. But the tranquility could not 
last. The ship’s men were not slow 
in deducing the cause of events. 

Their leader was a tall and arro- 
gant barbarian, whose mongoloid 
features youth made handsome in 
a striking way. His three com- 
panions were a mixture of races 
and traits that betrayed the in- 
homogenous blood of the Destroyer 
nations and their lack of cohesive 
ethnic groups. They were probably 
tenth-generation descendants of 
the more reckless star-travelers 
of the Great Exodus who had flung 
themselves out to the farther limbs 
of the galaxy to populate the 
new worlds and create the new 
federations. 

“You bloody insane, you make 
mischief after Daiquis’ warn you.’’ 
The leader signaled his armed com- 
panions into position with a mere 
movement of his finger. They were 
obviously a coordinated fighting 
team. “Now we’re goin’ make mis- 
chief back. You bloody Onaris 
Christian— le’s see you pray.’’ 

This I could enjoy , said Jaycee, 
with rare anticipation. Looks as 
though the boys are going to treat 
you to a little of their own kind 
of chaos . Trouble with you , Bron, 
is you never know when to stop 
sufferin ' . 



“Pray.” The order was accom- 
panied by a blow Bron could have 
avoided only at the peril of drawing 
fire from the weapons of the others. 
He took it hard and fell. A pair of 
metal-tipped boots in his ribs soon 
persuaded him that he would find it 
less painful to stand. 

“Now pray.’’ The mongol was 
jeering. “Pray to me. Pray to me 
for your life, Syncretis’— because i’s 
in my hands. Daiquis’ said shoot if 
you give any trouble — but I don’t 
think he’ll objec’ if I kick you 
dead instead.” 

Try turnin' the other cheek , Bron . 
He might die laughin'. You don't 
stand any other chance. Jaycee’s 
ecstatic titillation made him 
cringe. 

“Damn you for a vicious whore! 
One day I’ll—” 

A fist in the stomach doubled 
Bron forward and dropped him to 
his knees. As he folded, powerful 
arms seized his and dragged him 
upright again. The leader took his 
time about the demolition, using 
calculated swings to the head and 
body with fists that felt as solid as 
bricks. Jaycee played Job’s com- 
forter in Bron’s singing ears with 
practiced finesse and relish. Bron 
took as much punishment as he was 
able before he felt his consciousness 
slipping. Almost thankfully he 
leaned toward the enfolding 
blackness.

J TAYCEE’S voice. 

Perhaps it started as a whisper 
in some white wilderness . 

The pain and the consciousness 
flooded back as the semantic trig- 
ger threw off the protective black- 
out. The mongol’s eyes widened 
and a vicious thrust to the solar 
plexus made Bron scream with what 
little breath he still retained. 

... a broken body , cradled in 
cold , cry in futility unto a futile 
wind. 

“Jaycee, for God’s sake stop it! 
Let me go.” He made no attempt at 
subvocalizing. It was as much as he 
could do to form the words at all. 
She was playing with him, deliber- 
ately using the trigger to keep him 
conscious so that his awareness of 
the torment would continue. Again 
and again the blows fell savagely. 

... the mind *mazed not by the 
sear in steal, the nibblin nerve . 

“Jaycee, in the name of pity — ” 
He no longer cared whether he lived 
or died. All he wanted was release 
from the scientific and merciless 
battering his body was taking. 

. some maimed martyr, crazed 
upon the cross, held up his head and 
cried unto the heavens: Lord, why 
hast thou forsaken me? 

It was a full minute before he 
realized the punishment had 
stopped. Blood swam in his eyes 



and dripped warmly from his chin. 
He was still standing, but only by 
virtue of the arms that held him. 
Somehow he forced himself to ap- 
praise the situation. Two of the^ 
Destroyer shipmen were looking at 
something black and white. With 
difficulty he identified it as the 
Bible from his pocket. 

The leader advanced again. Bron 
held his breath, knowing that a few 
more blows, even though they 
might not render him unconscious, 
must certainly fatally injure him 
even if they stopped short of his 
death. But the blows never came. 
Through one eye he was astounded 
to see that the mongol’s face held a 
look of admiration. 

“J.C.,” he said. “Jesus Chris’. I 
seen many men killed by less beat- 
in’ than that. All of them wen’ out 
whimperin’. But you still pray. I 
don’ know# abou’ church, but i’ 
make you bloody tough man. Wish 
you were fight on my side. You 
bloody indestructible.” 

Dimly Bron discerned that they 
dragged him from the chartroom 
and even more dimly he felt a couch 
like an ocean of softness thrust be- 
neath him. He was only partly con- 
scious of the washing and the cool 
salve they heaped on his tortured 
flesh. But the one thing that burned 
in his consciousness before the 
blackness closed around him was 
the voice of Jaycee a million parsecs 



132 



IF 




deep within his head saying, That ’s 
only a sample of the tricks l can 
play on you % Bron. Til teach you to 
get so lucky as to forget about me! 

H E AWOKE in an unfamiliar 
cabin, sensing that someone 
had just left the room, but unable 
to explain the reason he thought 
this to be so. Not until the aroma of 
baked meats from a hot tray caught 
his nostrils was his suspicion 
confirmed. 

Wincing with the pain of move- 
ment he thrust himself off the 
couch and staggered toward a wall 
mirror. There the bruised and 
broken flesh of his face formed 
merely a setting for the deep and 
haunted eyes that looked back at 
him from under swollen lids. He 
made his way back to the couch and 
sat examining the contusions on his 
body while trying to force the 
brittle meats past his damaged lips. 
Finally he resigned himself to the 
pain and dared to drink the hot, 
salt beverage he found at the 
trayside. 

The food and the self-discipline 
needed to consume it rallied his 
spirits somewhat and he was finally 
prepared to meet the day. 

“Jaycee?” 

No. Veeder on-line. Jaycee s off 
doing whatever it is she does when 
you get her worked up that high. 
“Spare me the naive approach, 



Doc. I’m feeling anything but trust- 
ing this morning. That must have 
been quite a party last night. Haven’t 
felt like this since the morning after 
the last Christmas in Europa. Why 
did they let me live?’’ 

/ suggest two reasons. One — the 
Destroyers have an immense re- 
spect for strength and endurance. 
The punishment you took could 
easily have killed a man without 
your physique and training . Two— 
l suspect they haven t yet discov- 
ered the hellburners are missing. 
They returned all the controls in 
Weaponry to normal, walked out 
and locked the door. Being ship- 
men and not weapons men, they 
never thought to check the maga- 
zines. I don t know what you were 
attempting to do there, Bron, but 
you certainly paid for it. 

“I’d have paid a lot less if it 
hadn’t been for that hellvixen in 
my head.’’ 

They'd probably have killed you, 
said Doc sagely. It was your forti- 
tude and some lucky phrasing that 
saved you. I think you can thank 
Jaycee for your still being alive. 
We checked your new coordinates 
and you were right. The transposi- 
tion gives us a primary and five- 
body system location which is only 
just in the advanced indices. A per- 
fect setting for a baseworld, one we 
wouldn't ever have hit by chance. 
GenStaff \ has order d the entire

space fleet into the area. Estimated 
time is approximately one hundred 
sixty hours from now. 

The conversation was interrupted 
by the entry of the mongol ship- 
man. He grinned at the sight of 
Bron’s injured features and ruefully 
examined his own knuckles. 

“You bloody head like rock,” he 
commented sociably. He threw a 
Destroyer uniform on to the couch. 
“You wear this. You no’ wear 
bloody gown. You trained rightin’ 
man, no’ creepin’ Christian. 1 
know.” 

This time Bron saw no point in 
refusal. The uniform was an excel- 
lent fit. The cut of the cloth ac- 
cented his build and the width of 
his shoulders. The mongol, whose 
name was Maku,'eyed him with 
some respect. 

“You make damn fine De- 
stroyer, bloody sure. Could use you 
any time 1 fight.” 

Bron said nothing. The shipman’s 
understanding of him was intuitive 
and could not be dispelled by care- 
fully chosen words. The charade 
was breaking down. 

T hirty-five hours later the 
Tantalus dropped out of sub- 
space for the last time, well clear of 
the limits of the solar system. The 
Lab-Ship held station, waiting for 
the rest of the Destroyer fleet to 
drop into real-space for the rest of 



the journey. The sight was not one 
Bron would forget. At one moment 
the Tantalus was a metal splint 
alone in the wastes of space. Then, 
one by one, the rest of the fleet 
materialized about her without 
warning~and without other obvious 
effect. 

The arbitrary point of subspace 
dropout in relation to the nearest 
primary would not affect Com- 
mando calculations much. A swift 
survey of the planets in the system 
would soon reveal the few that 
could be considered life-supporting. 
From there on identification would 
be swift and the retribution mas- 
sive. Within days this area of space 
would become the mustering point 
for one of the largest avenging 
fleets of all time. Wherever Cana’s 
ships went, the slight gravitational 
distortion trails they left would 
soon betray their passing to a thou- 
sand detectors and lead like a 
silken thread to the planet on 
which the Destroyers had homed. 
Curiously enough, Bron felt the 
avengers would probably be too 
late. 

The subspace song was replaced 
by the thunderous vibration of the 
gravity drive as the Tantalus 
moved with its fellows. Although 
the shipmen were now busily con- 
cerned with navigation and the 
slow interjuggling as the overall 
command assigned orbit stations, 



134 



IF 




they were never too busy to depute 
one of their number to shadow Bron 
as insurance against further mis- 
chief. Bron did not mind. He had no 
immediate plans and his relation- 
ship with the crew had grown al- 
most cordial. Knowing the retribu- 
tion he had placed in their wake, 
he felt almost sorry that such un- 
quenchable characters as the^e 
were going to have to die. 

He was sleeping when the final 
maneuvering diverted the Tantalus 
out of the fleet formation to a posi- 
tion well apart from the others. 
It was perhaps the cessation of the 
thundering gravity drive and its 
replacement by nothing but ship 
noises and the infinite silence of 
space that broke the depth of his 
slumber and threw him into an ac- 
tive dream state. 

He lay no longer on the couch, 
but on a cushion, something as 
yielding yet as softly supporting as 
a woman’s breast or the lining of 
a womb. He was moving, traveling 
on a dark, irresistible tide toward 
some terrible genesis. He could feel 
the motion plainly, the halt and 
turn of eddy and wash. He was con- 
scious of unknowable pressures 
forcing him along, a peristaltic 
bulge cocooning his individuality, 
yet carrying him remorselessly 
onward. 

There were noises, glutinous, 
coagulant, semiliquid sounds sug- 



gesting vexatious geese being 
drowned in a slow torrent of 
treacle. The sounds broke and 
foamed around his head, a frantic, 
frothy psalm, a submerged and 
harrowing hymn to halt the unalter- 
able. And over all was the terrifying 
sense of doom, a great block of op- 
pression like a ceiling of living 
lead. 

Again he was making the journey 
“down the awful subterranean tun- 
nel. Again his intangible raft 
responded to ripple and eddy and 
he was able to sense clearly the 
dark and tortured path of the 
abysmal stream. As he encountered 
each dreaded curve he was pos- 
sessed by the profound fear that 
this particular deviation would be 
the last. Somewhere ahead he knew 
with unreasoning certainty he 
would come to the end. At last the 
way would open out into some 
atrocious cavern and he would be 
borne, exposed and defenseless, 
into the presence of a reality he 
was completely unprepared to face. 

Anticipation filled him with a 
nameless horror, begetting a rising 
panic that was enhanced by repeti- 
tion of its threatened imminence. 
And ever the liquid goose-mutter 
grew louder, more antagonistic, 
more agonized, more urgent, and 
more afraid. The babble was rising 
to a crescendo that threatened to 
force out sanity and replace it with 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



135 




something more alienly strange and 
fearsome than any delirium of 
madness. 

The blast of a trimming jet close- 
by shattered the nightmare and 
broke him out of his sleep. As 
consciousness returned he sized up 
the situation and threw himself 
from the couch to the hard reality 
of the floor. He fell heavily, but 
actually welcomed the pain as a 
blissful alternative to his terrible 
wanderings. But though the visions 
fled, the goose-mutter remained 
unmistakable now as a background 
to the star static and the carrier 
hiss of the transfer-link transmis- 
sions that were ever in Jiis brain. 

XII 

*<T^\OC? Jaycee? There’s that 
noise again on the transfer 

link.” 

It's neither of them , little sol- 
dier . They aren't here. 

“Ananias? I thought you weren’t 
allowed near the boards.” 

There are ways and means. Doc 
is apparently suffering from some- 
thing that got into his coffee and 
Jaycee ditto from something in her 
alcohol. Since I happened to be on 
hand I thought Td use this moment 
to come to a little understanding 
with you. 

“I already have an understand- 
ing. You’re a misbegotten, un- 



principled bastard, whose time is 
very definitely up the moment I 
get within throttling distance.” 
What a great thing it must be to 
have a defective memory , Bron. 
As I recall it, there used to be, two 
misbegotten, unprincipled bastards 
and you were the more misbegot- 
ten, the more unprincipled of the 
pair. One might even say / owe 
my success directly to your malign 
influence. However, I didn't come 
here to swap compliments. I want 
to give you a warning. 

“Jet off, Ananias. Nothing you 
can say is going to make the 
slightest difference.” 

But it must. You don't remember 
it — but there was a plan behind all 
this. By God and guesswork it 
might still come off. But it wont 
if you persist in flying off at odd 
tangents on your own. Undoing 
those Brick'S World coordinates 
was the stupidest stunt you ever 
pulled. 

“That must have taken quite 
some explaining, Ananias. Very 
inconvenient for you.” 

That's nothing compared to the 
damage you may have caused. My 
one hope is that the Commando 
Spacefleet won't be in time to 
catch any significant portion of 
the Destroyer task force. Why the 
hell don't you leave well alone? 

“What are you up to, Ananias? 
I don’t know what you’re aiming 



136 



IF 




at, but it certainly isn’t the success 
of the Commando operation.” 

Jupiterl Ananias was disgusted. 
You re so far out of orbit it just 
isn't true. I'd be tempted to hit 
the murder button and start out 
afresh if you weren't such a power- 
ful catalyst. I'm warning you, 
Bron, just play things as they come 
and don't start injecting any of your 
own chaos into the situation. If 
you attempt to foul things up again 
I'm going to have to stop you — 
even if it means blowing the whole 
thing wide open. Since you don't 
appear to rerrtember much , I'll 
leave you with something to think 
about. Do you know precisely who 
cooked up those false subspace 
coordinates? You did. It took- a 
twisted little brain like yours to 
work out that particular deception. 
And why? Because if those two 
fleets meet head-on they'll annihi- 
late each other. And what the hell 
will we do then? 

Bron fell silent, wrestling with 
the wrongness of Ananias’s words 
and unable to equate them to the 
situation as he knew it. He needed 
time to think. There -was some 
activity going on near the central 
spacelock. Equipment was being 
readied in preparation for a ship 
docking. He stood and watched, 
impressed by the smooth coopera- 
tion and coordination of the Des- 
troyer crew. These men obviously 



lived in space and knew it for the 
dangerous and relentless enemy it 
was. They were tough, uncompro- 
mising and thoroughly trained. 

With a frown Bron realized that 
if these formidible Destroyers 
were to engage in battle with the 
Stellar Commando fleet nobody 
was going to win. It would not 
be a one-sided mopping-up opera- 
tion. It would be a major running 
battle that would continue until 
one side or the other had been 
irrevocably beaten. And the few 
ships that limped home would be 
only the remnants of two of the 
most powerful fighting fleets in 
history. 

Ananias’s viewpoint made sense 
only if one took the view that the 
continuance of any spacefleet — 
even the Destroyers’ — was better 
than no fleet at all. If one con- 
sidered some common enemy . 
The sudden flare of goose-mutter 
in his head caused him to pause. 
And in that instant there fell across 
his memory the image of seven 
alien cylinders falling on Onaris 
from a distance of better than six 
hundred thousand parsecs and 
seven hundred million years of 
time. His mind spun at the immen- 
sity of his conclusion. 

“Ananias, I — ” 

No answer. 

“Ananias?” 

Again no answer. The transfer- 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



137 




link board had been abandoned 
and for the first time since the 
inception of the mission Bron was 
utterly alone. 

So concerned was he at his loss 
that he missed the beginning of 
some new phase aboard the ship. 
He was aware suddenly of a hard- 
ening of the men’s manner toward 
him, a certain wariness untypical 
of their previous relationship. He 
guessed that some instruction about 
him had been received by radio and 
that he was now to be regarded as 
a dangerous prisoner rather than as 
the faintly amusing academic syn- 
cretism Nobody immediately inter- 
fered with his liberty, however, 
and he was permitted to watch 
the docking maneuver as a trim, 
able-looking planetary ferry cou- 
pled with the Tantalus’s hull. 

But once the ship-to-ship cou- 
pling had been made and the final 
abandonment of the Tantalus had 
begun in earnest, he was no longer 
left in doubt of his position. The 
tall mongol approached, directed 
a handgun at Bron’s stomach. 
While he held unwavering aim he 
directed his comrades to attach 
wrist irons to restrict Bron’s hands 
behind his back and leg irons to 
confine his walking. A pad of a 
pungent somnific drug was held 
against his nose. Although he strug- 
gled not to inhale, he was unable 
to resist. Gradually Bron lost 



consciousness, slipped to the deck. 

Maku regarded the fallen figure 
with something akin to regret. 

“You no damn Christian. You 
damn fine fightin’ man, bloody 
sure. Hope Cana goin’ to look 
after you, ’cos Daiquis’, him bloody 
insane.’’ He looked back at his 
colleagues. “This a good man. 
Don’ matter abou’ which side 
you’re fightin’— good man is all the 
same. The side you fight for is^mat- 
ter where you were born. The man 
you fight with is matter of choosin’ 
sympathies. Damn sure him dead 
if he goes down in tha’ uniform.’’ 
He kicked the prostrate form 
affectionately. “Bron ’altern, you 
no right to go to ’ell in chains. 
But right now we got to get you 
out of ’ere. This ship damn sure 
is set for destruction, an’ Cana 
wants to make sure you don’ go 
with ’er.” 

B RON awoke in a cell. His 
wrist and leg irons had been 
removed and with them the Des- 
troyer uniform. While he slept 
somebody had carefully clad him 
in a clean, white gown and in his 
pocket the Bible hung with reassur- 
ing weight. The pallet on which he 
lay was undoubtedly planetbound, 
lacking the minute vibrations that 
characterized a shipborne berth. 

For a few seconds he lay collect- 
ing his faculties before he hurled 1 



138 



IF 




himself from the pallet in a frenzy 
of concern. 

“Jaycee! Doc! Ananias! Some- 
body answer me.” 

The cell looked out through a 
small glazed slit to a^ gray-tiled 
corridor. The thickness of the door 
limited his field of view, but nobody 
was in sight outside. 

“Jaycee, where the hell are you? 
Antares— if you have a monitor 
on this link, please call Control. 
This is an emergency—” 

He looked around in agony for 
some way of attracting attention 
from somebody. The solid door 
made only the barest perceptible 
noise when he beat on it with his 
hands and the glazing in the slit 
effectively stifled his attempts 
to shout down the corridor. 
“Jaycee— for God’s sake—” 

He heard a light groan over the 
goose-mutter and native mush of 
the transfer link. 

Weapiri demons! You aren’t 
in the market for a planet-sized 
hangover, are you? 

“Snap out of it, Jaycee. I’ve got 
to get hold of Ananias—” 

You’ve got to get hold of Anan- 
ias? Jaycee was incredulous. Bron, 
I’ve got first claim on gettin hold 
of Ananias — and when I do you 
won’t hear a thing for the scream- 
in ’ . That Godlost runt put some- 
thin in my drink . 

“Damn your dipsomaniac mis- 



fortunes. Do as you’re told. And 
get hold of Doc and tell him he’s 
got to stop the spacefieet. We’ve 
all made a ghastly mistake. - ” 

He’ll need a bit more reason than 
that to stop them now. 

“Find him and I’ll give him a 
reason. If those two fleets get to- 
gether they’ll wipe each other out.” 
Don’t tell me you’re gettin cold 
feet just because you’re sittin at 
the center of the action? 

“Jacee, I’m a dead man either 
way. But I just realized we’re fight- 
ing the wrong enemy.” 

Meanin? 

“That Cana was exactly right 
when he said he didn’t put that 
hellburner _down on Onaris. He 
doesn’t have that sort of weapons 
capability any more than we do. 
That thing was alien and it came 
in out of the void with pinpoint 
precision to kill a plapet of two 
hundred million people. Whatever 
creatures sent it in — it and the 
other thirty-five we’ve blamed on 
the Destroyers— they’re the real 
enemy. If we engage Cana’s fleet 
now we cripple both fleets and 
leave the galaxy wide open clear 
through to Terra.” 

If there are any aliens — what 
makes you think they’re cornin’? 

“I can hear them over the trans- 
fer link. And they’re the reason 
Cana had to build a strong Des- 
troyer fleet.” 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



139 




Not agreed , Bron. Cana built 
that fleet to strengthen his opposi- 
tion to Terra. 

“Cana doesn’t give a damn about 
Terra or the Stellar fleet. Try to 
look at it through his eyes. If he 
had a weapon like the Onaris hell- 
burner he could have put it 
straight down on Terra and for- 
gotten about the Stellar Com- 
mando. He wouldn’t have needed a 
major spacefleet in order to do it.’’ 
Point made, Bron. Tm puttin' 
out a red-alert call for Doc and 
Ananias. I don't think you'll con- 
vince Doc — and you haven't con- 
vinced me — but you do rate a 
bearin'. 

“I rate more than that, Jaycee. 
I’m right — and you know it.’’ 
That's Doc's decision. Meantime, 
Bron, you're still actin' under 
orders. Don't try and break away 
again or I'll have to bring you back 
into line. 

“I can’t wait, Jaycee. I’ve got to 
warn the Destroyers to get their 
ships away from here. We don’t 
dare let their fleet be destroyed. 
They’re the only force already pre- 
pared and waiting for the aliens.’’ 
/ can't permit you to move, Bron. 
Not until we see Doc's reaction 
on the spacefleet. He may decide 
we still attack. 

“I wasn’t talking about the threat 
from the Stellar fleet. I’m talking 
about a piece of chaos I cooked up 



on the Tantalus when I thought the 
spacefleet wasn’t going to get here.’’ 

Why? What the hell have you 
done? Jaycee’s voice was as hard 
as diamond. 

“Done? Jaycee, I arranged the 
destruction of this whole planetary 
system.’’ 

Spool the drama, Bron. You 
didn't have the hardware for that 
sort of action. 

T DID, Jaycee. I had the hell- 

A burners — I fired them from 
Tantalus in subspace. I precal- 
culated their subspace drop-out 
position and programed their sub- 
luminal trajectory from there. 
They’re due to arrive on target 
very soon now.’’ 

^ There's still no panic. Four 
Nemesis hellburners won't touch 
a spacefleet in orbit. They won't 
do more than blacken a couple 
of continents . 

“They can if you use them right. 
It isn’t just the baseworld that’s 
going to go — but everything on 
the three inhabitable planets of 
this system.’’ 

Stop tryin ' to pressure me, Bron. 
I know you're Satan incarnate, but 
not even you can do that with four 
small hellburners. Anyway, the 
Destroyers could see them cornin'. 

“Not where I sent them. On such 
a long approach trajectory they’d 
normally be detected and inter- 



140 



IF 




cepted as soon as they came within 
attack range. Mine weren’t pro- 
gramed ever to enter attack range.” 

" Then where the hell did you 
send them— into the primary ?" 

“No, their effect would have been 
negligible on a sun. But there are 
six planets in this system, of which 
this is the third. The neighbor to 
sunward and the one spaceward 
are also inhabitable, according to 
the Destroyer cosmological index 
on the Tantalus. But the innermost 
planet is too close to the sun and 
too dense to support life. It’s half 
molten and extremely friable. The 
hellburners are programed to go 
down on that.” 

They'll split it apart and . The 
last part of the sentence was lost as 
the implications of the situation 
swamped Jaycee’s powers of cred- 
ulity. But if any substantial part 
of it comes out of orbit and goes 
sunward you II get a flare that will 
sterilize the whole system . 

“If my calculations are correct,” 
said Bron, “almost the entire mass 
will go sunward. I’ve got to warn 
the Destoyers to pull out. I want 
an FTL transmission put out at full 
power from Antares on the Des- 
troyer emergency wavebands. Get 
me Antares on-line.” 

Bron, you know I cant do that 
without Docs authorization — and 
even he'd have to clear it through 
GenStaff \ 



“There isn’t that much time 
available. By the time GenStaff 
came up with a decision it would 
all be over.” 

He went to the cell door and beat 
on it with his hands. 

“Damn it, Jaycee, if you won’t 
warn the Destroyers I’ll have to 
find some way to attract their at- 
tention from here.” 

Don't try, Bron. You re still 
under orders and those orders still 
say the Destroyers are the enemy. 
If you attempt to warn the Destroy - 
ers it'll be mutiny. I'll stop you by 
any means I have. 

“Get off my back, Jaycee.” 

He slipped down and explored 
the bottom of the cell door with 
his fingers. 

Don't try anythin', Bron. You've 
already jumped out of tine once 
and had a heatin' taken out of 
your skin. Don't you ever learn? 

“Do me a favor, Jaycee— drop 
dead.” 

A small light fixture in the ceiling 
attracted his attention and gave 
him an idea. His hand brushed the 
Bible in his pocket and he took it 
out and examined it eagerly. 

Its material appeared excel- 
lently flammable. The metal bunk 
on which he had lain was his next 
objective. Fortunately it was not 
strongly secured to the wall. He 
wrenched it free. 

I'm warnin' you, Bron. If you

141 




cross me this mornin I'll kill you . 
Vm in no mood for your Godlost 
games . 

“Stay out of my hair, Jaycee. 
You don’t dare hit the murder 
button and none of the others is 
going to stop me.’’ 

B RON lifted the bunk and 
smashed the protective trans- 
parent shield away from the soli- 
tary light. The light itself faltered 
but did not go out. 

I don't know what you're up to , 
Bron , but quit now. I warn you 
I'm just in the mood to give you 
a taste of the punishment circuit. 

“You’d enjoy that, wouldn’t you, 
Jaycee?’’ Bron smashed the solid- 
state lamp away and the cell fell 
into darkness save for the dim 
illumination that came in through 
the slit in the door. 

God! Enjoy it? You don't know 
how near I come to usin' it some- 
times. Just out of— 

“Spite?’’ With the bunk on its 
side and with careful balance, Bron 
could just about reach the small 
wires he had exposed in the broken 
lamp fitting. 

Spite — revenge . — hatred — / 
don't know what the hell you induce 
in me. 

A careful twist of the fine paper 
tom from the Bible aligned in the 
diitiness between the wires ought to 
kindle to a spark, Bron thought. 



Another single sheet would give 
him scant protection against the 
current, but he dared not use more 
in case he damped the arc. There 
would probably be only one chance 
before the circuit protectors cut 
the current. 

Bron, I'm warnin' you . 

“Why don’t you press the button, 
Jaycee? If it’ll really give you 
satisfaction.’’ Under - his fingers 
the spark flared briefly but enough 
for ignition. A flame leaped up 
between his fingers as the dry 
paper caught fire. He jumped care- 
fully down from the edge of the 
bunk and began to pile page on 
separated page on the small fire 
he was making on the floor. 

Oh God, Bron — the urges you 
rouse in me — 

Bron successfully transferred a 
blazing sheet of paper to the door 
and pushed it under. He had no 
means of knowing whether the 
flame survived, but he fed more 
sheets beneath the door and hoped 
at least for smoke to stir some 
alarm system into operation. 

“Press that button, Jaycee, you 
vindictive bitch. If you dare. I’d 
be interested to know what it does 
—to both of us.’’ 

Prepared as he was, the pulse 
of pain that hit him was far greater 
than he had imagined possible. 
Almost every sensory nerve in his 
body seemed to contribute to the 



142 



IF 




pillar of corroding agony that 
possessed him. Even when the 
pulse was gone he lay for a full 
half-minute trying to erase the 
memory of those seconds. When 
he tried to speak his vocal cords 
were taut and the words would not 
come out. 

But he did not need to speak. 
Jaycee’s near hysteria came 
through clearly against the back- 
ground of goose-mutter and the 
blood-rush of the pulsars. He de- 
cided ruefully that those thirty 
seconds had cost Jaycee quite as 
much as they had cost him. Her 
distraught voice flared in his head. 

. you contaminate me, Bron. 
You twist everythin that's in me. 
Damn you — damn you . 

When the second pulse of pain 
began he knew from the sobbing 
that her finger was going to hold 
that button down for a long, long 
tfme. Perhaps until Doc or Ananias 
came and pulled it off. Fortunately 
she was too distressed to think of 
using the semantic trigger this 
time and mercifully he passed out 
where he lay. 



XIII 

H E CAME around spluttering. 

The Destroyers had thrown 
water in his face. He was no longer 
in the cell, but on the floor of some 



kind of communications room 
ringed with consoles. Daiquist, his 
face full of thunder, stood astride 
him, looking down. Cana stood to 
one side, his powerful intellect 
still striving to come to terms with 
the full implications of the situa- 
tion. Bron struggled to his feet, 
puzzled by the open accusation in 
their eyes. 

Daiquist swore. He said, “I ad- 
mire your nerve, but this is the last 
trick you’ll ever pull. And to think 
we carried you out from Onaris— ” 
Words failed him, as if some yet 
unexplained glimpse of Bron’s 
deception were a revelation greater 
than he could express, 

“I don’t understand you.” 
Desperately Bron tried to maintain 
his cover, but he knew instinctively 
that his cause was lost. Yet how? 
Why? Daiquist’s suspicions had 
hardened to a certitude, but the 
factor responsible for Bron’s 
suddenly altered status was not 
apparent. ' 

“What the hell’s gone wrong, 
Jaycee?” Subvocally. 

A nanias has sold you out, Bron — 
Her voice was dull and leaden. The 
sentence continued, but Bron was 
no longer listening to the words. 
He knew ail too suddenly what had 
gone wrong. As well as coming 
from the transducers in his head, 
Jaycee’s voice was issuing over the 
Destroyer’s loudpeakers. 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



143 




Daiquist’s smile was a mixture of 
triumph and malice. 

“Now, Syncretist— do you still 
fail to understand what I’m talking 
about? You and that on-line Com- 
mando bitch? We’ve learned quite 
a lot about you in this last half- 
hour. So she wants you to suffer? 
Well there I can certainly oblige. 
You’re going to suffer as nobody 
has ever suffered before. By the 
time I’ve finished with you I doubt 
if even the Stellar Commando will 
have stomach enough to send us 
another spy.’’ 

“If you were able to hear us,” 
said Bron, “you’ll know that I 
was trying to attract your attention. 
Those hellbumers I sent to the first 
planet— you’ve only got hours to 
get away before the sunflare.” 

“Judging from the extent of your 
deception this far I suspect this as 
just another trick. It would be only 
too convenient for the Commando 
if we abandoned our defensive 
position and scattered our ships 
right into the face of the approach- 
ing Stellar spacefleet.” 
v “It’s no trick,” said Bron. “I 
had no idea you could monitor our 
transfer link.” 

They didn't need to, Bron. 
Ananias took to space in an In- 
telligence radio ship. It seems 
he's interceptin' our transfer link 
and rebroadcasttn it throuh 
Antares on FTL radio over the 



Destroyer emergency wavebands. 

Cana shot a quick look at a radio 
Technician at one of the consoles. 

“Is that true?” 

“FTL transmissions on our 
emergency bands, damn sure.” 

“It could still be a trap,” said 
Daiquist sourly. “I’m going to 
take him apart the hard way. I'll 
make him plead to be allowed to 
talk.” ‘ 

Cana held up his hands. “No, 
Martin. If it is a trap — at least 
the Stellar spacefleet won’t catch 
us unprepared. We can clear this 
system in battle formation and 
meet them on equal terms. But 
my instinct tells me there’s no 
trickery involved.” 

“How do you arrive at that 
conclusion?” 

“Because the chaos patterns 
predict the destruction of the 
Tantalus. You heard where the 
Syncretist said he had directed the 
Nemesis hellbumers. Now tell me 
what you’ve done with the 
Tantalus?" 

“It’s abandoned in orbit around 
the first planet.” 

“And can you think of a more 
probable catastrophe that can 
happen to it than the one he has 
described?” 

“No — ” Daiquist’s face ex- 
pressed the measure of his agonized 
indecision. “But I still think I’d bet- 
ter take him — ” 



144 



IF 




“ Don’t you understand?” Cana 
turned on him the full force of the 
personality that held a whole 
federation of rogue planets to heel. 
“Martin— if the Syncretist is right, 
we’ll all be dead before you get 
your answers.” 

“Then just let me kill him. 1 
don’t fancy going into battle with 
the enemy having a direct intel- 
ligence link in our midst. Regard- 
less of what the patterns say we’ve 
already taken chances enough.” 

“No, Martin. I can’t permit it— 
and you know my reasons.” Cana 
turned to Bron. “I’ve got the 
greatest reservations about you, 
Commando or syncretist, which- 
ever you may be. The only reason 
you’re still alive is that whichever 
way we plot the patterns of chaos 
we always seem to find you at 
the causal focus of some of the 
most aggressive waves. Apparently 
you’re * the catalyst calculated to 
initiate some of the most violent 
entropic upheavals the universe 
has ever known. So answer me 
this, Bron Haltern, or whoever you 
may be— just how do you intend to 
take up the cosmos and twist it by 
the tail?” 

A sudden clatter came fronv one 
of the monitoring consoles and an 
operator cried out in surprise. 

“The Tantalus , sir. She ’ave 
stopped transmittin’. I think she 
bloody destroyed.” 



C ANA looked at Daiquist 
sharply. “Can you still doubt 
the patterns, Martin? That’s the 
hellbumer’s strike on the first 
planet. It could take hours for the 
fragments to reach the surface of 
the sun, but the consequent sun- 
flare will only take minutes to 
reach us. Order an emergency 
evacuation.” 

“I still think it’s a trick.” 

“Trick or not, can you still doubt 
the Syncretist’s ability to in- 
fluence events on a cosmological 
scale?” 

Daiquist was growing angry. 
“Look, Cana, what’s to stop me 
from shooting him where he 
stands? If I put a shot through 
him now, what of the patterns 
then?” 

“An interesting speculation, 
Martin. Since his effectiveness is 
already included in the patterns, 
either you will be prevented from 
touching him or we should gain 
first-hand knowledge of resur- 
rection. Either way offends my 
materialistic dignity, so I forbid 
you to try. I’ll take him with me to 
the flagship, while you organize 
the evacuation. We have a system 
to lose and a fleet to save, so there’s 
no use in arguing now.” 

With bad grace Daiquist turned 
to the radio operator, at the console. 

“Order a general alarm. All 
personnel to return to their ships 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



145 




and all ground staff to remuster 
for emergency evacuation. All 
ships to be placed in battle readi- 
ness fourteen system diameters 
out. This is a prime emergency 
and there will be no repeat of this 
instruction.” 

Daiquist moved across the room, 
now shouting detailed orders. Cana 
looked at Bron sagely. 

“Well, Syncretist, do I take you 
in chains or do I have your word 
that you will attempt no further 
mischief? In any case I ought to 
know your Commando rank.” 

“I can give you neither. First, 
I’m still on active service under 
control of Commando Central. 
Therefore I can give you no per- 
sonal assurances. Second, I’ve 
forgotten my rank along with most 
other details of my personal life.” 

“Then perhaps your mentor 
would be so' good as to supply the 
information?” 

He 's Commander Bron, of the 
Commando Central Intelligence 
Bureau, supplied Jaycee dully. 

Cana’s eyes widened appreciably 
and he smiled as if at some old 
memory. “Ah yes! I might have 
guessed. Tell me, Commander, 
does she hear me through you?” 

“Not only hears you— she can 
also see you.” 

“Remarkable.” Cana’s eyes 
instinctively searched Bron’s head 
but learned nothing of the trans- 



ducers buried deep into the skull. 
“I had underestimated the Com- 
mandos both for their technology 
and for the class of men they 
produce. Nevertheless I shall still 
have to think of you as Haltern the 
Syncretist, because that is un- 
doubtedly the catalytic role you 
have to play. Shall we go?” 

E SCORTED only by Cana’s 
aides, they went through a 
door and were suddenly in the open 
air, standing in a pale-gray light of 
what Bron took to be early dawn. 
Looking about him, he could see 
nothing but a stretch of sparsely 
vegetated wasteland stretching as 
far as the eye could reach. The air 
was damp and chill and inhabited 
by a forlorn sense of loneliness—/ 
the antithesis of what he would 
have expected from a Destroyer 
baseworld. Only the cleaved rock of 
the buildings they had just left sug- 
gested the works of man. 

Initially he was perplexed by 
the barren outlook. Then his 
estimate of the pale sun sharpened 
when he saw the height of its 
position. He knew then that this 
parody of winter was all the noon 
this blighted place was going to get. 
Nobody would build a base- 
world in a place so inhospitable 
and where the ecology was so 
starved of the essential energy for 
photosynthesis. The more he 



146 



IF 




thought about it, the more obvious 
the situation became. The 
Destroyer flesh-ships had not 
been making directly for their 
baseworld, after all. They had 
needed to unload their cargoes of 
flesh upon whatever world they 
had chosen to be worked. This was 
a mere colony world — a labor camp 
for the thousands of slaves who 
were to have been tossed upon its 
barren soils to‘ work out their 
lives under a sparse and alien sun. 

Men were cheaper than machines 
for initial colonization. They were 
more easily obtained, more 
versatile. They had the gift of 
self-duplication, which was not a 
feature of mechanisms, and, 
though vastly less efficient, they 
could be made to perform any 
labor a machine could do. It 
mattered little how many of them 
died in the fields, since a nurtured 
nucleus could always be used for 
breeding further stock. Thus, in 
the broadest economic sense, 
mankind had even yet triumphed 
over automation. Machines cost 
money and skilled attention: slaves 
cost no more than their transporta- 
tion and the cost of the whips to 
drive them to the fields. 

Bron felt suddenly sick. It 
was upon this gray wraith of a 
world that he had called down a 
vengeance to end all vengeance. 
The Destroyer fleet was still in 



orbit and the only craft visible were 
ferries. With the great spacefleet 
above preparing for battle with the 
approaching Commando fleet, it 
was a certainty that the hapless 
Onarian slaves would be hastily 
dumped on the planet’s surface to 
await the ordered coming of the 
sunflare that would sterilize the 
planet and everything that re- 
mained upon it. 

H E WAS aware that Cana was 
studying him closely and he 
wondered if the great Destroyer’s 
intellect could extend to an ap- 
preciation of his captive’s thoughts 
at that moment. If it did, Cana 
showed no sign. His features were 
hard with the granite resolution of 
a man who had been forced to per- 
form impossible tasks and had even 
more impossible tasks yet to 
perform. It was the face of a man 
whose visions were cosmic in 
content. 

Dotted about the far fields were 
the blunt ferry ships which formed 
the planetary link with the orbiting 
spacefleet. Around them a score of 
scudders swarmed like gnats, 
fetching and carrying services and 
personnel, hovering uncertainly, 
then darting swiftly to their destin- 
ations as the message of urgency 
spread among them. Occasionally 
new ferries would land and others 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



147 




depart. Groups of bewildered 
Onarian slaves were being driven 
to the wasteland and the ships 
refilled with Destroyer land 
crews hastily called back to join 
the battle fleet. 

Many long and anxious glances 
were directed toward the gray 
myth of a sun that might suddenly 
redden and expand to the dreaded 
sunflare. For one terrible moment 
this sad, pale world would know a 
summer more splendid than any- 
thing in its history. But accompany- 
ing the warmth and the light would 
come the bands of radiation and the 
increasing heat that would dry the 
seas, scorch the land and finally 
melt even the stubborn rocks for 
many kilometers down. Its happen- 
ing was a predictable certainty, but 
the timing of the event was a matter 
about which nobody could be 
precise. 

Bron, too, was possessed by a 
rising measure of concern — as if 
the cataclysmic nature of the 
impending doom held a psycholog- 
ical weighting that transcended his 
purely personal fear of death. His 
attention was drawn by a burst of 
activity as a new ferry landed 
nearer than the rest. Seven open- 
topped scudders, flying low with 
a deafening scream of engines, 
dropped in formation across the 
wasteland and halted only meters 
away. 



Cana motioned to Bron to climb 
aboard one of the craft, then 
turned back to look for Daiquist. 
He waited several minutes, looking 
alternately at his watch and at the 
sun, while a scudder pilot made 
frantic efforts to establish contact 
with Colonel Daiquist over the 
radio. Cana and Bron were joined 
by an increasing number of De- 
stroyer personnel evacuating the 
nearby buildings. As each scudder 
became loaded to capacity Cana 
waved it away, indicating his pre- 
ference to wait for a later craft. 
Since Bron was already seated in 
a scudder he found himself in a 
knot of anxious shipmen being 
whirled to a waiting ferry well ‘in 
advance of Cana’s own transport. 

Clad as he still was in the white 
robe and moreover, the known 
author of the current crisis, Bron 
could well have expected a high 
degree of antagonism from the 
Destroyers in whose company he 
had been thrown. Instead he en- 
countered the respect due a high- 
ranking Destroyer dfficer. Steps 
were provided to enable him to 
dismount from the scudder when 
the ferry was reached and on the 
vessel itself his safety harness was 
made ready for him. 

After a seeming eternity the ferry 
lifted off, climbing rapidly under 
the hands of a skilled crew, confi- 
dent even in an emergency. The 



148 



IF 




docking with the mother ship was 
precise and Bron had the feeling 
that he had never seen similar 
action performed more profession- 
ally by any Commando crew. 

A COURIER was waiting to 
take him to the ship’s bridge. 
Cana arrived there at about the 
same time. Almost immediately 
the ship began to throb with the 
overall thunder of the main gravity 
drive. The energy with which the 
drive was applied suggested that 
the ship’s departure from its 
orbital station was - a matter of 
crash urgency. Cana thrust him 
near one of the great navigational 
viewscreens and Bron could see 
precisely what the urgency was. 

He caught his breath as he gained 
a comprehension of the awesome 
sight. The scanners were trained 
on the sun upon which the little 
gray world had depended. But 
this sun was sparingly benevolent 
no longer. Broadly across its 
center spread a sunstorm of such 
frightening intensity that, even 
viewed from the ship’s present 
distance of better than a hundred 
million kilometers, its ferocity 
seemed to threaten to engulf all. 
But the boiling, granulated ferment 
of the storm was nothing compared 
to the astonishing outrush of the 
flaming, eruptive prominences, 
spreading probably &t a tenth of 



the speed of light like fantastic, 
feathered nuclear flames. The 
whole sun appeared to contract and 
then to swell and to belch out its 
infinitely hotter interior fires with 
such hellish virulence that the 
scanners had repeatedly to attenu- 
ate their reception of the scene in 
order to compensate for the 
spiteful increases in luminosity. 
And as the pulsing brilliance in- 
creased, so the feathered fingers 
of the sunflare fled farther and 
farther out into the massive 
volumes of space. 

It was impossible for Bron to 
judge the scale at which the boiling 
ebullition was portrayed, but the 
scanners panned repeatedly away 
from the initial spene in order to 
contain the rapid progress of the 
flare as it spread across the system. 
In advance of the visible extension, 
the vast increases in cosmic and 
ultraviolet radiation must already 
have punished the shielding 
atmospheres of the inhabitable 
planets beyond endurance. Even 
in this short time the second world 
must have become an irradiated 
hell. The third planet, which Cana 
had only just abandoned, must be 
under such a bombardment from 
the skies that life outdoors would be 
impossible and life indoors meant 
slow and certain death from the 
effects of primary and secondary 
radiation. The rapidity of the 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



149 




cataclysm far exceeded anything 
Bron had imagined. 

Occasionally the scanners picked 
up images of Destroyer ships, 
remote splinters of darkness 
against the brilliance of the spread- 
ing holocaust. Each ship was en- 
gaged in a long, forced, trajectory 
its command hoped would clear 
it of the planetary system and take 
it to a point beyond the corrosive 
fingers of the enraged sun. 

T HE scanners swooped down 
to concentrate in detail on the 
third planet. The groan of anguish 
was audible. Seven Destroyer ships 
were still in orbit and most pro- 
bably would remain so. Bathed in 
such a concentration of deadly 
radiation, it was certain that even 
their magnificent shielding could 
not prevent the destruction of their 
crews. 

From somewhere on the sur- 
face a ferry staggered into the sky, 
then lost control and, its drive still 
raging, nosed down again in a 
horrifying power dive to the 
planet’s surface. Cana called for 
more detailed views and one by one 
the orbiting ^ships were scanned and 
identified. None of the trapped 
ships betrayed any possibility of 
being able to move and only a 
little more time would ensure 
their complete sterilization. One 
day, perhaps, it would be possible 



to reclaim the vessels. For the 
men who had taken the ships to the 
far corners of the galaxy there was 
no hope at all. 

Cana’s flagship, Skua , fled well 
in advance of the grasping radia- 
tion fingers and soon the thunder- 
ing urgency of the gravity drive 
relaxed to a normal pitch. But 
Cana himself signaled no such 
relaxation. His quiet anger still 
ran with a tide of energy frighten- 
ing to behold. He called repeatedly 
for figures and data on the ships 
that got away — and on the ones 
left behind. Finally he turned to 
Bron with a wrath that seethed 
like a. cauldron only a hair’s 
breadth beneath the surface of his 
iron composure. 

“Do you know what you’ve done 
to me, Syncretist? You’ve cost me 
three inhabitable planets, at least 
seven ships, better than a thousand 
men— and Martin Daiquist.’’ He 
paused for a moment as words 
seemed to fail him. Then he 
continued, again fighting to pre- 
vent his anger from breaking 
surface. 

“One man, a bloody book and a 
headful of bio-electronics. Zeus! 
No wonder the patterns of chaos 
treat you with such respect. If 
this is what you can achieve as 
a prisoner— I shudder to think 
what could happen to the universe 
if they gave you a fleet.’’ 



150 



IF 




He turned his head sorrowfully in 
the direction of the screens now 
filled by a swollen and distorted sun 
which had been provoked into 
destroying the satellite planets it 
had nurtured for so many mil- 
lennia. “First I have to ensure my 
fleet is safe. Come to my cabin in 
an hour, Syncretist. We shall have 
a great deal to talk about.” He 
walked away, calling for a con- 
ference Qf ships’ captains and 
cursing the communications men 
who were fighting a losing battle 
with fierce electrical storms in an 
effort to maintain vital radio 
links in the face of an angered 
star. 

Bron lingered by the screens, 
still overwhelmed by the enormity 
of the havoc he had caused. 
Destruction on such a colossal 
scale using only four small 
Nemesis hellburners had been 
possible only because the perverse 
genius of his own mind had given 
]iim an idea that had magnified the 
normal potential of the weapons 
a millionfold or more. But he was 
not alone in appreciating his own 
talents for violent destruction. 
Somehow the dark entropic echoes 
of even more violent things he had 
yet to do were already throbbing 
their way through the continuum. 
He was facing a pre-destiny so im- 
mense in its effects that his as- 
sassination on Onaris had been 



ordered seven hundred million 
years ago in another island uni- 
verse, far across the terrifying 
voids of space. 

XIV 

J AYCEE spoke in a quiet voice, 
intruding on his reverie. Doc 
reckons you were lucky the sun 
didn't go nova, Bron . 

“Doc’s back?” 

He's been back for hours — re- 
playin' the tapes and tryin' to get 
some answers. 

“Answers tp what?” 

He lost out at GenStaff They 
took his command away from him. 
They've handed the whole show 
over to bloody General Ananias. 

“Including control of the space- 
fleet?” 

Ananias has got the whole lot. 
He's now Senior Advisor to the 
General Staff 
“Where’s Ananias now?’’ 

Still out on the Intelligence radio 
ship, I guess. A t least he's still inter- 
ceptin' our transfer link to Antares. 

“Which means he could be on- 
line?” 

Correct , little soldier. Ananias’s 
voice came in muffled but intel- ' 
ligible. Glad to see you're coming 
back on form. That was a piece of 
destruction that surpassed even 
your demoniac best. Trouble is, 
you hit at the wrong side. With you 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



151 




around we don't need any enemies. 

“Spool the noise, Ananias. 
You’ve got to stop the Commando 
space-fleet before they meet the De- 
stroyers. Cana’s fleet is battle- 
ready and desperate. I think they’d 
cut the Commandos to pieces.’’ 

Relax , Bron. Those two fleets 
wont get within parsecs of each 
other . I’ve already taken care of 
that. But my real worry is you. 
You've not only forgotten that there 
was a plan — youve even forgotten 
that it was your plan! Dont you 
remember anything? 

“Bits and pieces come back when 
I get a thread of connecting cir- 
cumstances— but the overall picture 
escapes me.’’ 

Then, for your information , we 
two were up to our necks in a plot 
about a kilometer thick that could 
have gotten us hanged a dozen 
times had it gone wrong. The fact 
that we've not yet been hanged has 
been due almost entirely to some 
very fast talking on my part. But I 
cant keep carrying you — nobody 
has a fund of luck that great. 
Youve got to get yourself straight- 
ened out — and fast. In the mean- 
time, dont make any major de- 
cisions without referring them to 
me. If you pull another crazy stunt 
like the last one well -likely lose 
Terra as a result. Jaycee, are you 
there ? 

On-line , Ananias. 



Look after this prize idiot. Were | 
taking the radio ship into subspace 
and we wont be able to maintain 
our interception of the transfer ,, 
link. If Bron moves out of line again ] 
clobber him with every correction \ 
circuit on the board. Til call you 
again as soon as we clear the jump. 

Engaged, Ananias. You must be j 
feelin very proud of yourself, you l i 
Godlostmewling. GenStaff has just 
confirmed their emergency deci- 
sion. It seems that from this mo - 1 
ment we* re all workin for you. 

Have I ever told you otherwise , 
honey-bitch? Didn't I always tell 
you to be nicer to the boss? But 
dont let circumstances fool you. 

I could never have cooked up a 
scheme half as big and twisted as 
this has turned out to be. The real 
insane architect of our misfortunes 
is on the other end of this transfer 
link. If he hadn't so conveniently 
lost his memory, he*d tell you so 
himself. 

A SUDDEN alteration came in 
Lthe quality of the sound as 
Ananias cut his circuits out of the 
transmission. The difference made 
Bron more conscious of the back- 
ground noises that entered his brain 
along with the hiss of the transfer- 
link carrier. He was alarmingly 
aware now of the increased strength 
of the goose-mutter. Not only was 



152 



IF 




it greater in volume— it was also 
more menacing in texture. The 
previous babble of sounds was sep- 
arating into discrete components, 
like the tones of individual geese 
talking through molasses. But 
whatever the language and what- 
ever the nature of the creatures who 
uttered them, the urgent tones of 
overriding panic were implicit in 
the sound. 

The rhythmic tones of this alien 
invasion into his head broke like 
waves on a seashore — but the waves 
were of waterglass and the crea- 
tures who generated them were 
drowning in a tide that swept 
shores far beyond the vast resources 
of the human Id. He realized with 
horror that if this emergent sound 
continued to increase in volume, 
there must soon come a time when 
it would swamp the human mes- 
sages over the transfer link arid 
leave him isolated in a gulf of 
foaming, gelatinous babble. In 
order to rescue himself from these 
dark concerns Bron had to force 
himself to concentrate on his own 
circumstances. 

“Jaycee, is Ander still available?” 

On call , Bron . Do you want me to 
signal him? 

“Urgently. I must know what a 
chaos catalyst is.” 

Engaged , Bron. It may take a few 
minutes to find him. By the way , / 
suppose I ought to feel sorry for the 



way I handed you that punishment. 
It was intended to make you toe the 
line— but I guess when you re in- 
volved as we are with each other 
it's almost impossible to keep your 
own feelin’s out . 

“That moment was inevitable, 
Jaycee, wasn’t it? It had to come. 
Do you ever think much about our 
relationship?” 

It’s not an experience I’m likely 
to be forgettin\ if that’s what 
you mean. 

“Ignoring the innuendo, that was 
roughly what I meant. It reminds 
me of the rapport— the mysterious 
marriage of minds between torturer 
and tortured. You’re more with 
me — and more one with me — than 
would be possible in any love-love 
coupling. I sometimes even think 
you know what I’m thinking.” 

I frequently do. Partly instinc- 
tively and partly because you 
unconsciously sub vocalize a great 
deal of your thinkin. You don’t 
transmit the thoughts too clearly , 
but I can often pick up the emotion . 
You don’t know how I crawl when 
you touch other women and I can 
read the conflicts in your mind. 

“Crawl, Jaycee? And what other 
women? I haven’t seen one this 
trip.” 

TJhey’re part of what you’ve for- 
gotten. And crawl is the word I 
mean , damn you. When your self- 
pity and self-hate burst out and

sour the love and the tenderness 
you should have for a woman , I feel 
I want to scream. I want to tell her 
— tell them all — that if they under- 
stood you as I understand you 
none of us would get hurt — not 
them and not me. 

“Or me?” 

That isn't implicit in the relation 
ship , Bron . You re the sufferer and 
the cause of the sufferin' . That's 
your role. I don't care how much 
you suffer as long as our liaison's 
allowed to continue. I know I'm 
goin to suffer through you regard- 
less— and that's the fact that tells 
me how deeply I'm involved. Only 
sometimes the rapport isn't suf- 
ficient. I feel the urge to get my 
nails and teeth into your flesh to 
even up the score. I get— high — Oh, 
God! That's your type of chaos, 
Bron. Right across the universe you 
seem to reach out and etch bits 
off me. 

She broke off as if interrupted. 
After a short period she came back 
again. 

I've got Ander on-line , Bron. I'm 
leavin' him with you. Doc's takin 
over the board, so if j>ou want 
anythin' further he'll be available. 
I'm goin ' out to get pickled so high 
I'll probably make orbit. 

Another voice broke in on the 
transfer link. Ander speaking. You 
want to know about chaos 
catalysts? 



< i ES, Ander. 1 keep being told 
I am one.” 

It's a fairly simple concept , Bron. 
You remember we established that 
increases or decreases in the normal 
rate of entropy were mainly the 
result of intervention by some form 
of intelligence such as Man's. Most 
individuals live their lives with very 
little effect on the overall pattern 
of entropy and therefore are not 
distinguishable singly. But there 
are a few whose influence catalyzes 
whole societies into new modes of 
action. The effective points of their 
lives can be traced with some pre- 
cision by entropic analysis. They 
cause detectable chaos ripples as 
their activities alter the slope of 
entropic rise or depression. We call 
these individuals chaos catalysts . 

“What sort of individuals are 
they?” 

Most of the tyrants of history — 
and a few of the saints. A lot of 
fundamentally great thinkers, 
mainly those concerned with phys- 
ical science . Almost no politicians 
and many, like yourself, whose 
innate capacity for destruction has 
left or will leave a permanent scar 
on history. The names of most of 
them wouldn't be familiar to you, 
because the judgment is based not 
on contemporary values but on the 
verified effects of the altered course 
of human history. 

“But history has no verdict on 



154 



IF 




me,” objected Bron. 

Not yet . But the patterns of chaos 
have . If we read them forward into 
time we can read the violence of the 
effects of which you will one day 
be the cause. It was the intensity of 
your chaos effects that caused the 
destruction of Onaris. 

“That’s a bit far-fetched, isn’t it, 
Ander?’’ 

Unhappily , no. All those millions 
of years ago some intelligent • life 
form must have read the same 
things in the chaos patterns and 
been afraid. They could have had no 
means of knowing what was to be 
the origin of those ripples , but they 
plotted the position in space and 
time so accurately that the Onaris 
hellburner was correct within 
meters and only a little late in 
time. 

“But why pick on me?’’ 

I suspect they were trying to avert 
the consequences of something 
you re going to do— you and the 
other chaos experts Cana has been 
collecting. But you re the prime 
catalyst, the main causal focus. I 
dont know what sort of thing 
you re going to do, but the shock 
spheres of the resultant are the 
most violent ever recorded. 

T HE clangor of the battle alarm 
shattered Bron’s speculation 
and brought the ship’s crew to a 
condition of readiness with speed 



and precision. In Bron the alarm 
keyed half-forgotten instincts and 
he automatically surveyed the 
Skuas bridge. With an increasingly 
professional eye he came to recog- 
nize the various conventions of 
Destroyer spacewar techniques and 
to translate them into terms he 
could understand. Then he stopped, 
perplexed. Instinctively his eyes 
had gone toward the detectors and 
screens that should logically be the 
sources of warning of approaching 
danger. 

But the screens were blank. Not 
one of them held a signal that could 
be interpreted as the cause of a 
battle alarm. Likewise the detectors, 
while straining to search the far 
recesses of the void, gave no clear 
voice to the suggestion of ap- 
proaching trouble. The eyes of the 
crew were intent on the computer 
bank, whose digital signals were 
trimming and correcting the de- 
tection instruments as if antici- 
pating some nemesis as yet well 
below the threshold limits of the 
apparatus. 

The situation reminded Bron of 
the hiatus before the Onaris hell- 
burner had come into detection 
range. Here was the same atmo- 
sphere of awe and expectancy — a 
situation that began in anticipation. 

“Doc, are you there?’’ 

On-line, Bron. 

“Make sure all the recorders are 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS

in trim. Something critical is 
coming up.” 

Engaged. By the way , do you 
want to give me any explanations 
before I have to turn my records 
over to the Commando Provost? 

“I don’t read you, Doc. What sort 
of charge could the Provost lay 
against me?” 

If it's in the Criminal Indices , it’ll 
be in the indictment. 

“Try a specific summary, L 
haven’t got much time.” 

Specifically, suppression of intel- 
ligence data, falsification of intelli- 
gence reports, manipulating 
Commando funds to finance un- 
authorized projects and various 
charges of espionage, sabotage 
and treason. 

“That’s enough to be going on 
with. I don’t remember a damn 
thing about any of those, so I can’t 
argue. How do you fit into all this, 
Doc?” 

Vm a very disappointed man. I’ve 
worked five years with you on this 
project, Bron — five years that have 
taken more out of me than I had to 
give . And what do I find? You and 
Ananias have been using me. 
Playing me for a fool. 

“You're no fool, Doc, and I’m 
sure 1 never took you for one. 
There’s a good reason behind all 
this — only I can’t quite figure it for 
the moment.” 

Then I suggest you ask Ananias, 



because Commando Central is gun- 
ning for him as well. 

“I thought Ananias was currently 
on top.” 

Politically, yes. But legally the 
Commando Provost’s building a 
case against both of you that even 
Ananias’s patrons on the General 
Staff wont be able to quash. I’ve 
tried to help you, but there’s 
nothing I can do unless you can 
give me an assist. 

“I can’t, Doc. I would if I could. 
But stay on-line, because some of 
the answers are out here and one of 
them could be the thing just coming 
up.” 

While he had beep speaking, the 
detectors had increasingly tight- 
ened their positions in response 
to the computer’s prognostication. 
Bron realized then, in the absence 
of any electronic returns by the 
instruments, that the current state 
of emergency had to be based 
entirely on real-time chaos pre- 
dictions. The complex and dimin- 
utive ripples of the entropic waves 
provided the point on which the 
instruments were being aligned. 

G radually the screens 
began to display a slight elec- 
tronic fuzz at the outer limits of 
their detection capability and well 
outside attack range. With some 
dismay he noted that the Weapons 
Control group did not appear to be 



156 



IF 




following the hardening settings. 
To check this he started across the 
deck. 

A hand arrested him. He turned 
to face Cana, who had come be- 
hind him unnoticed. 

“I can guess what you’re 
thinking, Syncretist— but it won’t 
work. Chaos predicts the alien 
vessel within firm plotting range 
inside ten minutes. It also predicts 
that we’re going to lose a ship. As 
soon as we can locate the alien 
accurately enough we’ll open fire 
on it. But we won’t alter the out- 
come— because we’re reading the 
chaos resultant of an event which 
has to take place. As far as the 
patterns of chaos are concerned, 
the loss of one of our ships is 
already a matter of historical fact.” 

“Not to me it isn’t,” said Bron. 
“You’ll soon have the alien’s ap- 
proach plotted in three dimensions 
plus the time component, with all 
the accuracy you need to make a 
kill. Are you trying to tell me that 
you can’t put sufficiently heavy 
weapons down that line to destroy 
anything that has space capability?” 

“Of course we can try,” said 
Cana. “But you still haven’t 
grasped the essential fact. We know 
our weaponry will not be effective, 
because we already know what the 
result will be. You can’t alter a 
future event for which you can read 
the firm resultant.” 



“Why not?” asked Bron. 
“Because to alter the unalterable 
is a contradiction in terms. By 
definition, you’re defeated before 
you can begin to compose your 
defense. How can you hope to win 
a battle which future history has 
already determined you’ve lost?” 

“I can see the argument, but I 
don’t accept it. I don’t see how the 
paradox could resolve itself— but 
that’s chaos’s problem, not mine.” 
Cana looked at Bron searchingly, 
then turned with swift decision. 
“Weaponsmaster, the Syncretist 
will direct the battle. Take his 
instructions as though they were 
mine.” 

Bron needed no second bidding. 
With long experience of Commando 
spacewar behind his intuition, he 
moved swiftly into action, briefing 
the Weapons Control crew to secure 
an immediate lock on the chaos 
coordinates. Then he turned back to 
Cana. “I presume you have chaos 
analysts who determine which 
patterns the computer is to process. 
I need to speak to them.” 

Cana signaled a communications 
man, who handed Bron a handset. 
“Chaos complex on-line.” 

“Fine! Correct me if I’m wrong, 
but we’re nearing a chaos resultant 
which appears to indicate the 
destruction of a Destroyer ship by 
alien fire.” 

“Da’s correct.” 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



157 




“What in the chaos evidence leads 
you to infer that the resultant is, in 
fact, the destruction of a Destroyer 
ship?” 

“Damn sure is ship. Eighteen 
teramegaton explosion don’ hap- 
pen in empty space unless ship and 
powerplant blow. Space-time co- 
ordinates indicate the corvette 
Anne Marie as only possible target 
approachin’ that poin’. We already 
issued evacuation instructions for 
the crew.” 

“Then cancel them. I want the 
Anne Marie powered and headed 
out of the area before the resultant 
comes to term.” 

“You can’ do that!” the voice was 
aghast. “You can’ beat chaos!” 

Bron turned back to Cana. “Con- 
firm that order for me, will you? 
I’ve got something else to arrange.” 

He turned back to Weapons Con- 
trol, began a rapid interrogation. 
The results were negative. He called 
the communications man to a 
conference and outlined his plan 
swiftly. In the face of his logic, 
nobody argued. In less than a 
minute they all knew what had to 
be arranged. Bron’s radical ap- 
proach begat an attitude of 
enthusiasm both infectious and 
in direct contrast with the former 
air of fatalistic acceptance. Only 
Cana remained unconvinced, but he 
did not interfere. 

By now the alien vessel was clear 



on the screens^ By human stan- 
dards it was a monstrosity— an 
unfinished bulk of black and 
sinister metal, blunt, rodlike and 
uninspired. Although it was moving 
at below light speed, its velocity 
was still greater than that of the 
Skua and her sisters. At this dis- 
tance the alien appeared eyeless and 
utterly without the finesse required 
of a vessel with deep-space capa- 
bility. As the battle-computer veri- 
fied its position, the alien’s image 
steadied under the crossed hairs of 
the screen and the final lock-on of 
instruments went to completion. 
The Weapons Control crew was 
now fully attentive to the task of ad- 
justing the last few decimal places 
for a detailed fix, which was at the 
extreme end of their weapon range. 

The weaponsmaster, taking post 
at the communications set, talking 
rapidly to his opposites in other 
Destroyer vessels, half-turned to 
watch the coordinates race across 
the computer’s readout panel. The 
agreement came swiftly. All posi- 
tions were set and maintained on 
lock by the battle computer. There 
would be no opportunity to rethink 
tactics if the experiment failed. 
Bron watched the critical registers 
run toward zero and nodded his 
acceptance. 

Human fingers keyed off the 
safety devices and the conduct of 
the battle passed into electronic 



158 



IF 




hands whose reactions were limited 
in speed by the velocity of light 
alone. But nobody on the bridge 
was deceived about the real nature 
of the confrontation. 

This was Bron the Syncretist 
against the inexorable patterns 
of chaos.

All the way, Bron . Alien as they 
come. No Cana trickery there. And 
that raises a whole load of ques- 
tions. The Ter ran government has 
always denied the possibility of an 
alien menace and especially the 
possibility of alien life forms cross- 
ing the void. The last election was 
fought on the strength of that 
promise. Seems they're wrong on 
both counts. 

“And Cana was right. The Ona- 
ris hellburner was obviously out of 
the same stable. It was the aliens 
who destroyed Onaris. And if Cana 
was innocent of that, how sure are* 
we of his part in the destruction of 
the other planets credited to him?” 

You ought to know , Bron. It was 
mainly you and Ananias who built 
up the case against the Destroyers. 
Tm transmitting these tapes to 
GenStaff. The Defense Council's 
going to have to do some radical 
rethinking in the face of this evi- 



dence. I'm recalling Jaycee to the 
board, but I'll stay on-line until 
she comes. 

“Engaged.” Bron watched the 
screens critically as the detectors 
cautioned that the alien ship was 
closing to target range. He was 
possessed by an unexplainable 
sense of something wrong, but was 
initially unable to place it. Then he 
realized that the goose-mutter in his 
head had died to a quiet hiss. This 
was not a mere attenuation of the 
signal— the fidelity was better than 
ever— but the noise was subdued, 
held a suggestion of hushed ex- 
pectancy, as if its alien originators 
were also spectators of the incident 
about to take place. 

Then, from the Skuas mighty 
projectors, the long, slim tubes of 
the space torpedoes carrying 
diffract-meson warheads slid 
silently into the soundlessness of 
space on an intercept course. So 
accurate was the plotting that each 
would find its appointed place on 
the target within meters. Such 
accuracy was unnecessary, since a 
diffract-meson missile could de- 
stroy any known vessel with space 
capability if detonated within fifty 
kilometers of its target — but Bron 
had opted to take not even the 
slightest chance. Such was the 
range of the screens that the bright 
needles indicating the torpedoes 
appeared to move like snails toward 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



159 




the alien, though in reality their 
velocity approximated one-hun- 
dredth of the speed of light. As 
yet the alien showed no sign of put- 
ting up a defensive screen against 
the attack or of taking any evasive 
action. 

Shortly a second salvo of missiles 
left the Skuas projectors. These 
were heavy power mines of more 
conventional nuclear design. Their 
direction was not toward the alien 
but to the theoretical point in space 
where chaos had declared an explo- 
sion must soon take place. Nor was 
the Skua alone in this action. Seven 
other Destroyer craft were also 
contributing a complement of high- 
powered explosives to converge on 
this same point. Of all the ships in 
the neighborhood, the dark alien 
alone issued no fire and gave no 
sign of anticipated combat. It 
carved its way solidly through space 
as if no battle existed. The goose- 
mutter became inaudible. 

The torpedoes reached their tar- 
get first. The fantastic flare of the 
dozen diffract-meson reactions 
overloaded the scanners and 
dropped the screens into a blank- 
ness that lasted many seconds. 
When the screens came back to 
life again, gasps of dismay came 
from watchers on the bridge. The 
alien vessel was both undestroyed 
and apparently undisturbed. It 
continued to plough a steady course 



into the middle of the Destroyer 
fleet, having survived a particulate 
reaction calculated to annihilate 
completely any object made of any 
material found in the known 
universe. 

A few moments later the power 
mines converged in space to form 
the eighteen tera-megaton explo- 
sion at the empty point where chaos 
analysis had predicted the Anne 
Marie should have been but for 
Bron’s intervention. The corvette 
itself had been hastily diverted and 
now lay witnessing the harmless 
diversion of its own fate. The ex- 
plosion formed the entropic resul- 
tant required to justify the existence 
of the particular chaos wavefront 
and effectively substituted for the 
ship Bron had saved. 

Cana’s eyes were alive with 
speculation. 

“Thank you, Syncretist! You 
begin to reveal a little of your prom- 
ise. No other man in history has 
ever managed to manipulate a 
chaos resultant successfully. You 
didn’t learn that trick in any mad 
seminary on Onaris — and I doubt 
it’s standard Commando practice, 
either. You’re not only a born cata- 
lyst but also a very remarkable" 
man.’’ 

B RON’S reply was halted by a 
sudden cry from the operator 
at the screens. He turned. The 



160 



IF 




image of the alien ship was being 
held in full focus and magnified 
to fill the limits of the frame. Al- 
though the diffract-meson impacts 
had done no obvious damage, they 
had apparently thrown the vessel 
out of its bald trajectory. Now the „ 
monstrous creation was rolling and 
tumbling, not so much in the man- 
ner of a ship thrown out of control 
as like a stick thrown idly into a 
wind. 

Bron and the Destroyers watched 
in fascination as the uncouth and 
mammoth cylinder rolled slowly 
end over end. They were treated to 
a good view of its imprecision as 
a ship, but gained no idea at all of 
its purpose or its mode of function. 
Then a shocking fact revealed itself. 
As the vessel turned it became ap- 
parent that its rear end was either 
missing or else had never existed. 
There were no drive tubes, no reac- 
tion mechanisms, no continuation 
even of an end wall. The whole vast 
structure was no more than an 
empty shell, a cylinder closed at one 
end and open to space at the other. 
It had no contents and no internal 
partitions. What form of mystery 
had accelerated it to such a velocity 
while holding it true along its major 
axis was a question Bron felt totally 
incapable of answering. 

The drama deepened as he 
watched incredulously. The tumb- 
ling enigma passed centrally 



through the point where the substi- 
tute explosion had occurred and 
continued blindly onward. The 
screens adjusted suddenly past it, 
as if seeking foreknowledge of its 
destination. The graticule settled on 
the distant image of another cor- 
vette, the Jubal . Barely had the gain 
been adjusted to produce a reason- 
able image when the dark, alien 
cylinder hit the Jubal like a throw- 
ing-stick striking a bird in flight. 

The conclusion was even less 
anticipated. By some unholy reac* 
tion both the Jubal and the alien 
artifact broke up — not apparently 
through force, but through a kind 
of mutual disintegration. There was 
no explosion, no obvious release of 
energy, merely a crazy annihilation 
of the mass of both bodies as they 
came into physical contact. In- 
credibly, each seemed to contain a 
state of matter that was the anti- 
thesis of the other. The effect was 
a kind of cancellation of the exis- 
tence of both, with no manifesta- 
tion of the latent energy that should 
have been the consequence of the 
complete destruction of so much 
mass. Shortly the only evidence of 
the event was a small quantity -.of 
space flotsam and an enigmatic 
question mark in the minds of the 
men who had observed it. 

ALMOST immediately thegoose- 
jLjL mutter rose to a crescendo 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



161 




inside Bron’s head. Automatically 
he thought of it as the cheering of a 
vast crowd, yet the unintelligible 
semantic undertones were more 
indicative of fear than jubilation. 
However, the aliens were certainly 
witnesses to the event, because the 
timing of their resurgence was too 
precise to be coincidental. His mind 
tried to contain their alienness, but 
balked at the task. These creatures 
were things with means and talents 
beyond the ken of anything in hu- 
man experience. He had no inbuilt 
references on which to hang his 
hazy concepts of them. Only two 
things they seemed to share with 
human kind — hostility and fear. 

Cana said, “We seem to have 
worthy enemies, Syncretist. 
They’re taking you on at your 
own game.’’ 

“How do you mean?’’ asked 
Bron. 

“You cheated chaos by substi- 
tuting your own reason for the 
existence of a wave in the pattern. 
They countered by destroying the 
Jubal by means that would not pro- 
duce an entropic wave. By chaos - 
analysis your method is indistin- 
guishable from a real event, theirs, 
from a classic non-event. Which 
means we stand a very good chance 
of winning.’’ 

“How do you compute that?’’ 

Cana smiled tiredly. “My dear 
Syncretist, we have evidence, such 



as the Qnaris hellburner, that the 
aliens have been experimenting 
with chaos for hundreds of millions 
of years. I was watching you just 
now and your reactions were in- 
stinctive. You evolved an answer 
comparable with theirs in some- 
thing under seven minutes. Now I 
see why they’re so afraid of you.’’ 

A furious burst of static in his 
head warned Bron of something 
occurring on the transfer link. Then 
a muffled but recognizable voice 
broke in. 

Ananias on-line. Do you read me, 
honey-bitch? 

Veeder reading you, Ananias. 
What the hell's going on? 

Listen in. Doc , and keep a line 
open to GenStaff. I've already sent 
in my report. This next session's 
going to be critical. Bron , are you 
reading me? 

“Like a book, Ananias. What’s 
the readout?’’ 

We've just cleared subspace and 
made rendezvous with the Com - 
ntando fleet on the Rim. I've a 
task force of sixty-eight ships here, 
all battle-ready and eager for a 
killing. I'm broadcasting on FTL 
radio as well as on the transfer link 
because I want Cana to hear what 
I have to say. 

“I hope you’re not thinking of 
threatening him. He’s easily got 
twice the firepower you can 
muster.’’ 



162 



IF 




Threaten him ? You must be out 
of your tiny addled mind . We 
haven t come to threaten — we’ve 
come to join him . Chaos predicts 
the main alien spacefleet only a few 
days out in the void . From the 
looks it’s a bloody armada rather 
than a fleet — and it’s going to do a 
hell of a lot of damage. 

Bron turned to Cana. “General 
Ananias is trying to contact you on 
FTL transmissions. He reckons the 
alien main fleet is only a few days 
out and he wants to bring the Com- 
mando fleet to help.” 

“Tell him I’ll talk to him,” said 
Cana. “I’d been wondering if he 
ever would keep the pact we made 
on the Tantalus after we rescued 
him from the void.” 

XVI 

I N THE Skua’s communications 
room Bron supervised the ad- 
justment of the FTL communica- 
tions web until two-way contact 
was established with Ananias. Cana 
waited impatiently until he could 
_speak the first word. 

“General Ananias — my intelli- 
gence network gives me no favor- 
able impression of your attitude 
toward the so-called Destroyer 
federation of planets.” 

“I warned you at our last meet- 
ing, Cana, that such a situation 
might be necessary.” 



Indeed yes. But for the benefit 
of the Commando authorities who 
may have access to this conversa- 
tion, I should prefer to hear the 
record set out plainly.” 

“As you wish. You know as well 
as I that the alien menace is a real 
and active threat not only to the 
Rim Dependencies, but to your 
federation— and ultimately to 
Terra itself. We’ve both known this 
for many years. Unfortunately, 
such has been the insecure structure 
of Terran governments over that 
period that any account of alien 
threats to our galaxy has been re- 
jected as irresponsible alarmism. 
The Terran standpoint is^ unten- 
able. I have been in the void in com- 
mand of the Tantalus and have 
personally witnessed the sort of 
physical threat posed by the aliens. 
You yourself must know only too 
well what type of danger they are 
to our existence. I think you’ll 
agree the evidence shows they ap- 
pear to have no intention of allow- 
ing humans any sort of foothold 
in space.” 

“I agree with your summary this 
far, General. But you dodge the 
issue. Why have you so persistently 
vilified the Destroyer nations?” 

“I’m not dodging the issue. I’m 
attempting to explain. Since I was 
unable to convince the Terran 
government about the alien threat 
I had to adopt a more extreme tac-

tic. It was obviously necessary for 
Terra's defense that a strong space- 
fleet be developed and maintained. 
In connivance with Commander 
Bron of Stellar Commando In- 
telligence, we deliberately at- 
tributed facets of the alien’s long- 
range attacks to the Destroyers. 
By this ruse we were able to en- 
courage Terra to invest in a supe- 
rior defensive spacefleet oh the 
misguided assumption that the 
Destroyers were the real enemy. 
Neither Bron nor myself ever be- 
lieved this, but we consistently 
misreported the evidence to make 
it appear to be the truth. For some 
reason you were a credible danger, 
while the aliens were not. Since 
Bron is now in your hands l must 
make it clear that he was the major 
architect of our policy of decep- 
tion. He is also one of the most 
powerful chaos catalysts our 
analysts have ever detected* For 
this reason we decided to manip- 
ulate him into the situation with 
the greatest concentration of fire- 
power. That’s why you now find 
him in your camp rather than 
ours.” 

“Is this true, Syncretist?’’ asked 
Cana. 

“I wouldn’t know,’’ said Bron. 
“But it does supply a lot of missing 
pieces. Did you say I planned this, 
Ananias?’’ 

“Every crooked move of it, Bron. 



It was a scheme that suited your 
talent for playing the system 
against itself. You tricked the 
Commandos into sending you right 
into the hands of the Destroyers— 
which was where you most wanted 
to be. Only a few of us knew that 
you went to join the Destroyers 
rather than fight them. The trouble 
was, you nearly undid all of us 
when you lost your memory half- 
way through the act.” 

“Accepting that. General,” said 
Cana, “what proposition had you 
in mind?” 

“With the evidence of this 
transfer-link conversation added to 
my own reports, Terra can no 
longer deny that the alien threat 
exists. Whether she likes it or not, 
Terra is now committed to help 
you agairtst the common enemy. 
But however close the cooperation, 
I v can’t see Terra permitting her 
fleets to come under Destroyer 
control.” 

“Do they need to?” asked Cana. 

“Come!” reproached Ananias. 
“You know the inverse square law 
as applied to spacewar battle 
tactics. Two small independent 
fleets have only a twenty-five 
percent chance of survival com- 
pared with one larger coordinated 
fleet.” 

“That’s statistically correct, but 
it still raises an impasse. Since we 
were lately enemies I can’t happily 



164 



IF 




subscribe to the notion of the 
Destroyer fleet becoming subject to 
Terran control.” 

“Then here’s my proposition. If 
I can swing Terran opinion, would 
you be prepared for both fleets to 
come under Bron? He’s an exper- 
ienced battle -commander. He’s 
certainly the prime chaos catalyst 
at this time— and his location with 
your fleet seems to be an effective 
compromise between Terran and 
Destroyer viewpoints.” 

C ANA looked at Bron specula- 
tively. “I’ve lost Martin 
Daiquist, my lieutenant, so I 
don’t have a candidate of my own 
to offer. Having seen Bron in action 
just, now. I’m prepared to believe 
that he’s the one man who can 
handle the job. I can accept your 
proposition only if both fleets are 
subject entirely to his control— and 
without his being subject to 
pressure from Terran sources.” 
Jaycee on-line , Bron. Jaycee’s 
voice came into Bron’s head alone 
and was not repeated over the 
speakers. We’ve rerouted the 
transfer link so as not to interfere 
with Ananias’s broadcast. Gen- 
Staff s been monitoring your 
conversation on-line , and they’re 
in agreement with Ananias’s 
scheme , if you want to follow 
through. The final decision’s up to 
you . 



“That was quick, Jaycee. What 
shook them up?” Bron spoke 
subvocally. 

Partly the tapes Doc took from 
your earlier report and partly the 
fact that fourteen planets of the 
Rim Dependencies have stopped 
transmitting. Three of them got out 
messages saying they were being 
attacked by something from the 
void. They were certain it was not 
the Destroyers. There was a major 
defense panic until somebody 
realized that you and Ananias 
already had the situation solved. 
Are you going to take the job?” 

“It’s not the decision, it’s the 
capability that worries me. Yes, 
I’ll take it— but get hold of Ander 
and put him to checking through 
the tapes on the encounter with that 
alien ship-thing. There may be 
chaos implications there that we’ve 
missed. Certainly unless our 
weaponry is more effective than it 
was then, we’re lost before we 
start.” 

Engaged , Bron. I’ll be reportin’ 
as soon as we get some answers. 

Bron turned back to Cana, who 
had been watching the progress of 
the unheard conversation as it was 
mirrored on Bron’s face. 

“I have Terran GenStaffs 
agreement to your terms. I’ll take 
the job on the assurance that I 
won’t be subjected to pressures 
from you either.” 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



165 




“You have my word on it,” said 
Cana. 

“I warn you,” said Bron, “it’ll 
be a rough ride. A little while ago 
you lost a perfectly good corvette^ 
to a sort of alien throw-away 
container. If we can’t get the better 
of a garbage can by using diffract- 
meson warheads, then what the hell 
do you think is gojng to happen 
when we meet their battle fleet?” 

“I don’t know,” said Cana 
heavily. “I’ve been living with 
that specter for years. Because of 
it I forged the independent 
planets into the Destroyer Feder- 
ation, knowing all the time that we 
never really stood a chance if the 
aliens crossed the void in force. 
But I’m growing older and it’s 
going to be a war for swift brains 
and nimble fingers. I’d groomed 
Martin for the job— but he couldn’t 
survive you. Somehow I doubt the 
aliens will have any better luck. 
There’s something about you, 
Syncretist, that is unassailable.” 

ii ANANIAS,” said Bron. 

l\. “Fourteen planets of the 
Rim Dependencies have stopped 
transmitting. Presumably some of 
the aliens got there first. Can you 
send a scout formation and get 
some positive information? Also 
relay to me data on what classes 
of ships you have available and 
details of their armaments. Too, 



you must have some kind of chaos 
computing complex. I want a full 
hookup with Cana’s chaos men. 
The aliens have a few hundred 
million years start on handling 
chaos and I want us to catch up 
fast.” 

Engaged, Bron. You know, this 
is quite like old times— 

“Then get off-line and get busy. 
Put a few scoutships out in the void 
and try to get us some facts and 
figures about the strength and 
disposition of the alien fleet. And 
stay off the transfer link. Use the 
FTL radio unless you have an 
extreme emergency.” 

There was the sudden cessation 
of the hiss of a carrier wave as 
Ananias cut out his circuits. Npw 
that the bio-electronic relay had 
less to contend with, he was again 
conscious of the sound of drowning 
geese. Perhaps twenty individual 
voices predominated over the 
general babble and these prime 
spokesmen rippled across the 
audible spectrum in a hideously 
broken yodel, as though their voices 
were modulated by large bubbles 
rising through a silo of molasses. 
Their mood sounded nervous, quick 
and urgent, as if indicating that 
time was a critical factor of their 
actions. 

The babble was hypnotic and he 
was powerless to shut it out. The 
rise and fall of the anxious spokes- 



166 



IF 




men suggested the swell of a stygian 
river, while the quieter, more 
powerful background mutter was 
that of a pressing tide. Perhaps an 
ultrasonic ceiling to the echo in the 
voices gave the impression of a 
cavern roof, caught under hundreds 
of kilometers of dark pressure, yet 
extending onward like a dreadful 
pipe leading into an unknown 
darkness. 

He had no doubt now that these 



were the voices of the aliens in the 
void. By some obscure trick of 
physics, their communications 
system infringed on his own trans- 
fer link. If their voices could fetch 
him such strange and alien visions, 
he wondered equally what the 
byplay between Jaycee and himself 
could mean to them. He was not 
eveir sure at times what it meant to 
him — let alone her.

“Yeah. Take the rest of the day 
off. But before you go* remember 
to feed the elephant.” 

“You have a pet elephant?” 1 
murmured. 

“Who said anything about pets? 
Some of my musician clients are 
alia time coming over and banging 
on my grand piano. I got tired of 
replacing the busted keys, so I; 
figgered it would be cheaper raising 
my own ivory. In this business you 
gotta watch all the angles.” 

I bad no answer to that, so I 
turned and stared down at the pala- 
tial expanse of San Simoleon, the 
Slobkin estate. 

“Quite a view, huh?” he com- 
mented. “On a clear day you can 
see the smog.” 

I shook my head. “How did you 
ever manage to find a place sur- 
rounded entirely by mountains?” 

“Just wanted privacy, dig? Mat- 
ter of fact* it wasn’t surrounded. 
When I came here it had mountains 
on only three sides. I built the 
fourth one myself.” 

“And that kidney-shaped swim- 
ming pool—” 

“You like it? Had a doctor design 
it for me. Modeled after one of my 
own kidneys. On the other side I 
got a liver-shaped swimming pool. 
Which I don’t use, on account of 
hepatitis.” 

Slobkin led me to the elevator 
and- we descended to the Grand 



Ballroom. A golden fountain cas- 
caded merrily at one end, and Slob- 
kin produced glasses that he held 
beneath the spray. 

“How’s for some champagne?” 

I took the glass, staring in ad- 
miration at his tattooed arm. 

“Neat, huh?” He flexed his biceps. 
“It’s an original Picasso. You know, 
Sidney Picasso, the'old-time artist’s 
grandson. Had him do it the last 
time I was in Paris. Some day I’ll 
get something put on my chest. 
Maybe one of them there Remnants, 
or Rembrands, whatever.” 

“Rembrandt is dead,” I said. 

“Hell, too bad. I should of caught 
him on the first trip.” Slobkin led 
me to a sofa before the fireplace, 
at which silent, unobtrusive servi- 
tors were barbecuing a yak on a 
spit. We settled back in comfort. 

“Let’s rap about you,” he said. 
“Been over three years since we 
huddled. What’s the scam?” 

“Nothing to tell. I’m still a free- 
lance writer.” 

Slobkin frowned. “Same bag, 
huh? Speaking of which, I bet you 
still got the same wife, too. You 
never did have no ambition. Look 
what I done in the past couple 
years.” 

“I’m looking,” I told him. “And 
I still can’t believe it. Just think, 
when I met you, all you had was 
desk space in that little office over 
on Smogset Strip.” 



THE OLD SWITCHEROO

His frown deepened. “That pay- 
toilet! No wonder I never got no- 
where being an agent— crowded into 
the same room with ten other guys. 
Why, in those days 1 didn’t even 
have a spot to pitch in.’’ 

I nodded. “You couldn’t get a 
line into the studios. 1 remember 
how excited you were the .first time 
you landed a part for a client. Who 
was that, anyway?’’ 

“It was a chimpanzee,’’ Slobkin 
said. “I had a deal lined up with 
Paranoid Pictures. They were 
to use him as somebody’s stand-in 
for Beyond The Backside Of The 
Planet Of The Apes. Only he 
bombed. Once the chimp got a 
whiff of makeup he decided to quit 
show biz a^id go into politics.” 
Slobkin grimaced with angry dis- 
taste. “Believe me, / didn’t vote 
for him. But he got in anyway. 
More champagne? Or a little caviar, 
maybe? I’ll have one of the boys 
run down to the pond and squeeze 
out a sturgeon.” 

“Never mind.” I gestured him 
back into his seat. “What I want to 
know is what happened to you. How 
did the change come about?” 

“ivr o change ’” j ° e siob- 

kin told me solemnly. 
“Just the old switcheroo, that’s all. 
The old switcheroo.” 

“You’re going to tell me about 
it, aren’t you?” 



“Sure. That’s why I had you 
come out here. Figured you could 
use a story. And this one’s a grab- 
ber. This one I could break with 
any of the services. But I wanted it 
should go to you, baby.” Slobkin 
chewed sentimentally on the end of 
his cigar. 

I leaned forward. “Would it by 
any chance happen to concern 
your two biggest clients? Has it 
something to do with Ricky Ticky 
and Michele Belch?” 

Slobkin nodded. “I’ll tell it like 
it is.” 

And he did, just as I’m putting it 
down here. Only the grammar has 
been changed, to protect the 
innocent. 

Three years ago (Joe Slobkin told 
me) there was no such person as 
Ricky Ticky. There was no such 
person as Michele Belch. There was 
just poor old Joe Slobkin, the ten- 
percenter, sitting in his little desk- 
space and trying to figure out how 
he could live on ten percent of 
nothing. And there was a kid named 
Oscar Fink and a chick named Irma 
Schmutz. 

“Very straight,” Slobkin said. 
“And loaded with talent. This Irma 

N 

Schmutz could do anything — sing, 
dance or play all kinds of instru- 
ments, including musical. Oscar 
Fink was great, too. Particularly on 
imitations. That stud could do a 
take-off on anybody/ Really a nat-

ural, dig? But neither of ’em had a 
dime and neither of ’em had a 
chance. I guess that’s why they 
finally ended up with me. 

“Well, I did my best, but it was 
like nowhere. Two of ’em got ac- 
quainted in my office and they used 
to come in together, sort of like a 
team. One day they leaned on me— 
wanted to know what was wrong. 
So I laid it on them. 

“I told ’em the whole hangup 
was they were weak in the looks 
department. This Irma Schmutz 
was just what you might call an 
average bird. Brown hair, thin face, 
a little on the tall side. Also, her 
chest was flat enough to play 
Scrabble on, if that’s your kick. 

“Oscar Fink was in even worse 
shape, what there was of it. He was 
short, had kind of a high voice and 
ran to fat. 

“So what’s a guy gonna do? You 
know how important the old image 
is in this industry. And 1 put it to 
them just that way, let it all hang 
out. 

“Nobody was happy when I got 
finished. Irma said, ’But Oscar is 
a good mimic. He doesn’t have to 
be a gr6ovy-looking stud for that, 
does he?’ And Oscar said, ‘Irma 
can play and sing and dance even 
with her clothes on — what more do 
you want?’ 

“I told ’em it wasn’t a question 
of what I wanted. It’s what the 



public wants. Brown-haired, flat- 
chested babes don’t get to be 
stars— they just get married. 

“And that’s where Oscar Fink 
came up with the beginning of the 
switcheroo. 

“He told me something I should 
of figgered for myself all along. 
‘Fake it,’ he said. ‘All you got to do 
is fake it. What kind of chicks made 
it in the oldtime movies? Right from 
the beginning it’s been big-busted 
blondes — Jean Harlow, Marilyn 
Monroe and all those other broads. 
How many of them used their real 
names? How many of them were 
real blondes? How many of them 
had natural big busts?’ 

“Well, I had to admit he was 
right, at least about the names and 
the blonde part of it. The busts I 
never had a chance to investigate, 
not firsthand, that is. 

“Oscar Fink poured it on. ‘So 
you change her name,’ he said. 
‘And dye her hair. And you do a 
little shopping for falsies at 
Farmer’s Market or wherever. 
Teach her to wiggle when she walks 
and pitch her voice lower. No 
problem.’ 

“This got Irma all excited. Don’t 
forget Oscar, either,’ she said. 
‘Maybe he looks more like a crud 
than a stud, but he has talent. What 
about all the hard-rock and souL 
singers with the way-out names? 
They weren’t handsome either, but 



THE OLD SWITCHEROO 



171 




you couldn't see their faces under 
the hair. They mostly didn’t sing, 
just howled. Like this.’ And she ups 
with a demonstration which is like 
to tear my ears off. 

UQO Isay, ‘Okay, why not? We 
O got nothing to lose. First off, 
we change the names. From now on 
there ain’t no Irma Schmutz and 
Oscar Fink any more. From now on 
you’re gonna be — let’s see — Michele 
Belch and Ricky Ticky.’ 

“Just like that the names come 
to me. After which I slammed out a 
couple of fake biographies, got in 
touch with some flacks who owed 
me a few favors, went out and 
bought them a mod wardrobe on 
credit, rounded up an electronic 
guitar from a hockshop, and we 
were rolling.’’ 

Joe Slobkin paused to catch his 
breath, and his third glas.s of 
champagne. 

“You don’t have to tell me any 
more,’’ I said. “Everybody knows 
what happened after that. Michele 
Belch got a walk-on bit in a family- 
type home-nudie and became a 
sensation the moment she stopped 
walking and started to lie down. 
Ricky Ticky signed with an obscure 
recording company — Obscure Re- 
cords, wasn’t it? — got a few 
numbers on cassettes — and the 
phones began to ring all over the 



country. It’s been a pushover all 
the way.’’ 

Joe Slobkin shook his head. 
“That’s what you think. Only it 
wasn’t quite so easy.” 

“But all this happened, didn’t 
it?” 

“Sure it happened. Only not at 
first.” 

“What did happen first, then?” 

“They bombed.” 

I frowned. “You mean the scheme 
didn’t work?” 

“That’s right, baby. It didn’t 
work. Changing names wasn’t 
enough. Planting stories wasn’t 
enough. I ought to have figured it 
from the start. Maybe a smart 
flesh-peddler can take a skinny 
little chick and build her up into a 
real C-cup personality. Maybe he 
can turn an insignificant little in- 
sect into another Beatle. But he’s 
got to have something going for 
him if he wants to hit the top ten on 
the Porno Graph. The chick has to 
be sexy; the guy has to put a gut- 
feeling into his vocal chords. 
Trouble is, all these two had was 
ability. And so they bombed.” 

I stared at him. “How can you 
say that? They did make it. The 
stories are true, you built them up, 
made big stars out of them, made 
millions. ” 

Joe Slobkin smiled patiently. 
“Later. After I figured out the 
angle.” 



172 



IF 




“What angle? Is that the story 
you’re giving me an exclusive on?” 
The little agent turned pale. “Not 
in a million years!” he gasped. 
“This is all off the record, get me? 
The yam I want you to break is—” 
“Joe, baby-!” 

My head swiveled at the inter- 
ruption, then nearly fell off as 
Michele Belch wriggled into the 
room. She was every bit as blonde, 
as bosomy and as beautiful as in 
my wildest dreams. She was puffing 
on an Acapulco roach. 

“Hiya sweetheart!” 

It was Ricky Ticky, in the flashy 
flesh; tangled hair mopping his thin 
forehead and his velvet blue-jeans 
glued to his gluteus maximus with 
a crotch-clutching closeness. 

“Everything set?” Joe Slobkin 
inquired. 

“Copasetic.” Ricky nodded at 
Michele. “We trans off for New 
Vegas in five minutes, right from 
your pad here. Be married in an 
hour. Got my guitar all packed for 
the honeymoon.” 

“Beautiful!” Joe Slobkin beamed 
and advanced on Michele. “How’s 
the bride? Got enough luggage and 
everything?” 

“Just my hope chest,” she replied, 
with a shy downward glance at the 
article in question. 

I gulped. “This is true? These two 
are going to be hitched?” 

Slobkin nodded at me. “Eloping 



right now. That’s why I got you over 
here. In a couple of hours the wire- 
tapes will have the whole enchilada 
—but it’s yours, right now, in ad- 
vance. Minute they leave, you get 
on the com and make a deal with 
the media for your exclusive. To- 
morrow you’ll be made, baby— the 
guy who beat old Jill Haber and Bill 
Katz to the biggest news item of the 
century.” 

He turned and faced the loving 
couple. “This guy’s my buddy,” he 
murmured. “I want you two to co- 
operate— answer any questions he 
lays on you.” 

“I’ve got no questions,” I said. 
“I think I can handle it without a 
routine interview, and something 
tells me you’re botji anxious to get 
on your way.” 

“Yeah.” Slobkin nodded, frown- 
ing at Ricky Ticky. “Something 
tells me the same thing, and get 
your hands off her until the honey- 
moon. Or at least until you’re on 
the trans.” 

Ricky Ticky grinned at me. 
“Mighty nice of you to under- 
stand.” 

I took a deep breath. “Just one 
favor, though. Uh — could I kiss the 
bride?” 

Michele Belch gave me a sur- 
prised look. Then she took the ciggy 
out of her mouth, crushed it and 
stood indecisively for a moment, 
holding it in her hand. A quick 



THE OLD SWITCHEROO

glance was exchanged between her 
and Ricky. Then, with a coy ges- 
ture, she waved her butt at me. 

I ADVANCED to claim my re- 
ward. Somehow 1 hadn’t reck- 
oned on the bearskin in front of the 
fireplace. My heel caught in the 
bear’s open jaws and I slipped. My 
hands, seeking to encircle Michele’s 
shoulders, grabbed at her hair 
instead. 

It came off. 

“Holy Toledo!” cried Joe Slobkin 
“Get the hell out of here! 

Ricky Ticky began to sob. “Now 
look what’s happened! He’ll spill 
it — I know he’ll spill it!” 

“No he won’t!” Slobkin shouted. 
“He’s with it. Besides, I was gonna 
tell him anyway, after you left. 
Just cut out now, before anybody 
else sees you. Split!” 

He herded them off in the di- 
rection of the elevator, and 1 sank 
back on the sofa as the babble of 
their voices died away in the 
distance. 

A moment later Joe Slobkin re- 
turned. Silently he handed me a 
glass of champagne and silently I 
drank it. 

“So that’s how it is,’* I said. 
“Yeah.” He sighed deeply, then 
shallowly. “That’s how it is. I told 
you they bombed. And then I lucked 
out. 

“I got to thinking about the way 



they’d given me a pitch that day in 
the office. Here was a kid who could 
imitate anybody — so why not an 
imitation of a chick? What was 
wrong with giving him the falsies, 
and maybe a good wig? 

“And here was a chick who had 
talent for any instrument and a 
voice that could lift the roof off an 
outhouse at three hundred feet. 
Why not let her grow the mop and 
wear the jeans? So I put it to them, 
and they bought it, and the rest is 
like history.” 

“Unisex, eh?” 

“Right,” Slobkin assured me. 
“Like I told you, it’s nothing but 
the old switcheroo.” 

Many months have passed since 
the truth was revealed to me there 
in the Grand Ballroom of Slobkin’s 
estate. Since that time the marriage 
of Ricky Ticky and Michele Belch 
has reached the point where a 
blessed event is in the offing. I tv 
view of this fact, their secret can 
remain a secret no longer, and I 
am thus privileged to reveal the 
facts. 

What I’m really hoping for now 
is that my old friend Joe Slobkin 
will see fit to give me another ex- 
clusive story. I’d like a scoop on 
the impending birth. 

But up to this time, Joe Slobkin 
hasn’t quite made up his mind 
whether they’re going to have a 
boy or a girl. #

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

Many thanks for the most hope- 
ful and encouraging story in years. 
I refer , of course, to Dazed by 
Theodore Sturgeon (Galaxy, Sept. 

9 71 h 1 

I wish it were true — and in that 
respect I am encouraged by his 
statement that “belief of disbelief 
has no effect on objective truth.” 

Judith Guccione 
Peru , III. 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

As a newcomer to the readership 
of If lam lacking of certain infor- 
mation. Mainly , how to purchase 
a copy of Galaxy to find out 
whether or not I wish to subscribe 
to it. I have not been able to find 
it on any of my local newsstands or 



anywhere else and I am interested 
in having a look at it. 

Now, as regards If, specifically 
Gambler’s Choice in the March/ 
April ’71 issue, I have a slight 
correction. In the problem stated, 
as any student of probability will 
tell you, all the fractions involved 
are what is called mutually exclu- 
sive. That is, simply put, only one 
of the circling torpedoes must be 
hit twice. Multiplying the fractions 
1/362, 2/362 . 25/362 wjll give 
the chances of hitting one torpedo 
for a second time on every shot, 
provided, of course, that the num- 
ber of torpedoes hit onc^expands 
miraculously after each successful 
shot. 

The proper equation for a situa- 
tion where the odds change between 
attempts is the first odds (1/362) 
added to the second odds (2/362) 
minus the product of the two (this 
allows for overlap) for two at- 
tempts. Since Mr ; Shaw has given 
Mr. Targe tt 25 shots, the answer to: 
1 / 362 +2 /362-( 1/362x2/ 362) must 
be added to the next fraction: 
3/362 and the product of those two 
subtracted and on and on till 
25/362 is reached and operated 
upon. 

In other words , for any two mu- 
tually exclusive probabilities (A & 



175 




B), the total probability is equal 
to A+B-AB . For three fractions 
this rapidly expands to: ( A+B - 
AB)+C-(A +B-AB)xC. For twenty- 
five fractions (not including zero, 
because A+0-Ax0 = A) the pro- 
blem is enormous. 

The reason for my delay in writ- 
ing this is because I have finally 
been given access to a computer. 
With a simple loop the computer 
can solve the problem. The chances 
are 60.134% in Mr. Targett’s 
favor , or three out of five. The 
odds are three to two, not two to 
one, as stated in the story. Still, 
not bad. 

If Targett’s first shot had had 
any chance of shooting down a 
torpedo the chances would have 
been two to one.

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

Some years ago Jack Vance be- 
gan a series of novels about the 
Demon Princes and how one man, 
Kirth Gersen, set out to kill them 
one by one. To my knowledge Mr. 
Vance has only written the follow- 
ing books in the series: The Star 
King, The Killing Machine and 
The Palace of Love. There were 
five Demon Princes and the above 



novels deal with the fates of three 
of them. Could you possibly tell 
me if Mr. Vance has abandoned 
the series or, if he hasn’t , where 
interested readers might obtain 
copies of the other two (I presume) 
books ' ? 

Let me just say that if Mr. Vance 
has abandoned the series I consider 
it a great loss, because each novel 
was meticulously written and ex- 
tremely interesting. The social 
and cultural background for the 
stories is one of the most imagina- 
tive and well conceived galactic 
communities I have ever come 
across. 

If you could come through with 
this information for me I would 
really appreciate it.

We’re dose to 
a cure for 
leukemia* 




A year ago, we wouldn't 
have dared say that. Not 
with that beautiful word 
"cure" in it. 

"Temporary remission", yes. New forms 
of leukemia treatment were helping some 
children stay alive a little longer. But that 
seemed to be all that medical science could 
give them. Another few months. Another 
birthday or two. 

Now we're seeing something that's almost 
too good to believe. A whole crop of kids who 
are alive and well 5 years or more after get- 
ting a new kind of drug therapy. And after 
5 years, cancer researchers begin to hesitat- 
ingly, hopefully, talk of a permanent "cure." 

Leukemia is cancer of the blood. Before 
you have a cure, you have to destroy every 
last cancer cell in the bloodstream. The new 
treatment is a combination of different anti- 



leukemia drugs, so that, 
hopefully, any cells missed 
by one drug might be killed 
by another. 

It seems to work. We're still holding our 
breath, but it really seems to work. The 5-year 
survivors that gladden our hearts today are 
the result of combination treatments begun in 
1964. And work has been going on fever- 
ishly ever since. Each year, the children who 
get leukemia have a far better chance of cure 
than those of the year before. 

The American Cancer Society plays a vital 
part in this exciting work. So, when our volun- 
teer comes to your door this month, be gen- 
erous. Especially if you have children. Or 
grandchildren. 

American Cancer Society! 

We want to wipe out cancer in your lifetime!*
