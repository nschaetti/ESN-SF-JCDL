TOMORROW'S AUTOMOBILE — The small powerful jets which speed this 
car of the future through the air also drive it along the surface by transfer- 
ring power to wheel locomotion. On the surface, the wings collapse and fold 
back into the body, giving it a "teardrop", streamlined effect. There are 
three wheels, two in front and a single drive-wheel in the rear, with the three 
wheels forming a wide triangle. The "run-about" shown here holds two 
passengers.

A CHAT WITH 
THE EDITOR 

BY NOW you have probably read 
the first two winning stories in IP’s 
recent College Science Fiction Con- 
test with the theme: “What Will 
America Be Like 100 Years From 
Now?” The first-prize story “And 
Gone Tomorrow” (December is- 
sue), by a student at the University 
of Louisville, prophesied a world 
dictatorship, with a caesar akin to 
the old style Roman emperors. And 
there were several other manu- 
scripts based on the same premise 
— that the United States would 
some day be a dictatorship itself, or 
part of one. 

These youngsters were extrapo- 
lating on present day events, and 
to do this one must be keenly aware 
of political and economic trends. 
And their prediction of a dictator- 
ship for the U.S.A. comes uncan- 
nily close to the mark, for dictator- 
ship — and there is no good or 
benevolent one — is looming all too 
closely on the horizon. It won’t 



even be 100 years from now. It 
could be in your time and in my 
time. 

The first step in this all too pos- 
sible autocracy will take place this 
year — for this is the year the heads 
of the A.F.L. and the C.I.O. will 
decide whether or not to merge 
their strength and become one gi- 
gantic union. From their point of 
view this would be an ideal set-up, 
and it is likely that the merger will 
go through unless something is done 
to stop it. 

The influence which unions all 
over the country now have in our 
state and national governments is 
blatantly obvious. Political candi- 
dates curry favor with unions and 
union members for their votes and 
for their contributions to the coffers 
of the election funds. This wedge of 
votes and money has opened the 
way for pro-union legislation which 
puts these huge groups in the driv- 
er’s seat in both government and 
industry. 

Mind you, this state of affairs 
exists now, when there is decen- 
tralization of union power; imagine 
what it will be like when one or- 
ganization can control the votes, 
labor and lives of millions of mem- 
bers who directly or indirectly 
affect the lives and living of every 
hutnan person in the nation! 

If a merger such as this goes 
through, it would involve some- 
thing like 14,000,000 C.I.O. and 
A.F.L. members alone, and affect 
practically every industry in the 
United States. With such influence 
as this in operation, it is reasonable 
to assume that independent unions, 
with millions of additional mem- 
bers, will jump on the bandwagon. 
The whole movement will become 



2 



a huge free-rolling steamroller with 
one man, or a small group of men, 
holding the wheel. 

I believe in unionism, when there 
is honesty and integrity; I also be- 
lieve in good government. But there 
can’t be sound, unhampered gov- 
ernment when a union is so large 
that it can bring the industrial 
might of a nation the size of the 
United States to a standstill. For 
example, smaller organizations 
have been able to cripple shipping 
on both the Atlantic and Pacific 
coasts with dock strikes; the steel 
industry, and all the industries that 
depend on steel such as aircraft, 
automotive, and ship building 
plants, were brought to a halt by a 
strike of steel workers not too long 
ago. Textile mills, electronic lab- 
oratories, coal mines, transporta- 
tion, even the atomic laboratories 
at Oak Ridge have come to a stand- 
still at one time or another through 
the medium of strikes. The pressure 
that can be brought to bear when 
such a strike affects something as 
vital as the national defense (as in 
the case of the atomic workers 
strike) is so great that even the 
decentralized set-up we have now 
is too powerful for the good of the 
nation. It isn’t too difficult to im- 
agine then, how a vast octopus-like 
union, able to pull a strike in all 
industries at once, could wreck the 
Ship of State. The heads of such a 
union would have more power than 
the President of the United States; 
such all-powerful men could de- 
mand anything they wished — and 
get it; they could get the men of 
their choice elected to the senate 
and congress and the White House. 
Not only could they control the 
reins of government with their vot- 



ing blocs, but they could also physi- 
cally control the country’s indus- 
tries and thus the actual livelihood 
of the entire population of the 
United States. 

There is another factor to con- 
sider. Labor unions have had a 
tough fight to gain recognition, and 
the leaders of these unions have 
been trained in hard schools. But 
such training hasn’t lessened the 
fact that men who have emerged as 
leaders may very easily have feet 
of clay . and that personal ideol- 
ogy and whim may sometimes have 
a far reaching effect. For such is 
the nature of man when he has un- 
limited power. 

A dictatorship is the next easy 
step. 

The power of unions is so 
great already that the President of 
the United States, the members of 
Congress and the Senate may even 
now find that their political lives 
are in jeopardy if they voice oppo- 
sition to the proposed merger. Let 
us hope, however, that political 
leaders will realize what this merger 
means, and put the welfare of 3ie 
nation before their own and see to 
it that immediate legislation is 
passed to break up this centraliza- 
tion of union power. Let us hope 
that the union members themselves 
have the insight to realize what an 
uncontrollable monster they may be 
hatching, and that they will have 
the guts to place their country be- 
fore their jobs and fight to preserve 
the democratic form of government 
under which this nation has pros- 
pered. 

I would be the last to deny that 
unions have done more good than 
evil, that the working man needed

WAR VETERAN 



Problem: The future must be changed! . 
For he was a throwback from the future, 
this old man, veteran of war yet to come; 
war in which Earth was annihilated. 

Illustrated by Kelly Freas 



T he old man sat on the park 
bench in the bright hot sunlight 
and watched the people moving 
back and forth. 

The park was neat and clean; 
the lawns glittered wetly in the 
spray piped from a hundred shiny 
copper tubes. A polished robot 
gardner crawled here and there, 
weeding and plucking and gather- 
ing waste debris in its disposal slot. 
Children scampered and shouted. 
Young couples sat basking sleepily 



and holding hands. Groups of 
handsome soldiers strolled lazily 
along, hands in their pockets, ad- 
miring the tanned, naked girls sun- 
bathing around the pool. Beyond 
the park the roaring cars and tow- 
ering needle-spires of New York 
sparkled and gleamed. 

The old man cleared his throat 
and spat sullenly into the bushes. 
The bright hot sun annoyed him; 
it was too yellow and it made per- 
spiration steam through his seedy. 



BY PHILIP K. DICK 





ragged coat. It made him conscious 
of his grizzled chin and missing left 
eye. And the deep ugly burn-scar 
that had seared away the flesh of 
one cheek. He pawed fretfully at 
the h-loop around his scrawny 
neck. He unbuttoned his coat and 
pulled himself upright against the 
glowing metal slats of the bench. 
Bored, lonely, bitter, he twisted 
around and tried to interest him- 
self in the pastoral scene of trees 
and grass and happily playing chil- 
dren. 

Three blond-faced young soldiers 
sat down on the bench opposite 
him and began unrolling picnic 
lunch-cartons. 

The old man’s thin rancid breath 
caught in his throat. Painfully, his 
ancient heart thudded, and for the 
first time in hours he came fully 
alive. He struggled up from his 
lethargy and focussed his dim sight 
on the soldiers. The old man got 
out his handkerchief, mopped his 
sweat-oozing face, and then spoke 
to them. 

“Nice afternoon.” 

The soldiers glanced up briefly. 
“Yeah,” one said. 

“They done a good job.” The 
old man indicated the yellow sun 
and the spires of the city. “Looks 
perfect.” 

The soldiers said nothing. They 
concentrated on their cups of boil- 
ing black coffee and apple pie. 

“Almost fools you,” the old man 
went on plaintively. “You boys with 
the seed teams?” he hazarded. 

“No,” one of them said. “We’re 
rocketeers.” 

The old man gripped his alumi- 
num cane and said, “I was in 
demolition. Back in the old Ba-3 
Squad.” 



None of the soldiers responded. 
They were whispering among them- 
selves. The girls on a bench farther 
down had noticed them. 

The old man reached into his 
coat pocket and brought out some- 
thing wrapped in gray torn tissue- 
paper. He unfolded it with shaking 
fingers and then got to his feet. Un- 
steadily, he crossed the gravel path 
to the soldiers. “See this?” He held 
out the object, a small square of 
glittering metal. “I won that back 
in ’87. That was before your time, 
I guess.” 

A flicker of interest momentarily 
roused the young soldiers. “Hey,” 
one whistled appreciatively. “That’s 
a Crystal Disc — first class.” He 
raised his eyes questioningly. “You 
won that?” 

The old man cackled proudly, as 
he wrapped up the medal and re- 
stored it to his coat pocket. “I 
served under Nathan West, in the 
Wind Giant, It wasn’t until the 
final jump they took against us I 
got mine. But I was out there with 
my d-squad. You probably remem- 
ber the day we set off our network, 
rigged all the way from — ” 

“Sorry,” one of the soldiers said 
vaguely. “We don’t go back that 
far. That must have been before 
our time.” 

“Sure,” the old man agreed 
eagerly. “That was more than sixty 
years ago. You heard of Major 
Perati, haven’t you? How he 
rammed their covering fleet into a 
meteor cloud as they were converg- 
ing for their final attack? And how 
the Ba-3 was able to hold them 
back months before they finally 
slammed us?” He swore bitterly. 
“We held them off. Until there 
wasn’t more’n a couple of us left.

And then they came In like vul- 
tures. And what they found they — 

“Sorry, Pop.” The soldiers had 
got lithely up, collected their 
lunches, and were moving toward 
the bench of girls. The girls glanced 
at them shyly and giggled in antici- 
pation. “We’ll see you some other 
time.” 

The old man turned and hobbled 
furiously back to his own bench. 
Disappointed, muttering under his 
breath and spitting into the wet 
bushes, he tried to make himself 
comfortable. But the sun irritated 
him; and the noises of people and 
cars made him sick. 

He sat on the park bench, eye 
half shut, wasted lips twisted in a 
snarl of bitterness and defeat. No- 
body was interested in a decrepit 
half-blind old man. Nobody wanted 
to hear his garbled, rambling tales 
of the battles he had fought and 
strategies he had witnessed. Nobody 
seemed to remember the war that 
still burned like a twisting, corrod- 
ing fire in the decaying old man’s 
brain. A war he longed to speak of, 
if he could only find listeners. 

y ACHEL PATTERSON jerked 
his car to a halt and slammed 
on the emergency brake. “That’s 
that,” he said over his shoulder. 
“Make yourselves comfortable. 
We’re going to have a short wait.” 
The scene was familiar. A thou- 
sand Earthmen in gray caps and 
armbands streamed along the 
street, chanting slogans, waving im- 
mense crude banners that were visi- 
ble for blocks. 

NO NEGOTIATION! TALK IS 
FOR TRAITORS ACTION IS 
FOR MEN! DON’T TELL THEM 

WAR VETERAN 



SHOW THEM! A STRONG 

EARTH IS THE BEST GUARAN- 
TEE OF PEACE! 

Jn the back seat of the car Edwin 
LeMarr put aside his report tapes 
with a grunt of near-sighted sur- 
prise. “Why have we stopped? 
What is it?” 

“Another demonstration,” Ev- 
elyn Cutter said distantly. She 
leaned back and disgustedly lit a 
cigarette. “Same as all of them.” 

The demonstration was in full 
swing. Men, women, youths out of 
school for the afternoon, marched 
wild-faced, excited and intense, 
some with signs, some with crude 
weapons and in partial uniform. 
Along the sidewalks more and more 
watching spectators were being 
tugged along. Blue-clad policemen 
had halted surface traffic; they 
stood watching indifferently, wait- 
ing for somebody to try to interfere. 
Nobody did, of course. Nobody was 
that foolish. 

“Why doesn’t the Directorate 
put a stop to this?” LeMarr de- 
manded. “A couple of armored col- 
umns would finish this once and 
for all.” 

Beside him, John V-Stephens 
laughed coldly. “The Directorate 
finances it, organizes it, gives it free 
time on the vidnet, even beats up 
people who complain. Look at 
those cops standing over there. 
Waiting for somebody to beat up.” 

LeMarr blinked. “Patterson, is 
that true?” 

Rage-distorted faces loomed up 
beyond the hood of the sleek ’64 
Buick. The tramp of feet made the 
chrome dashboard rattle; Doctor 
LeMarr tugged his tapes nervously 
into their metal case and peered 
around like a frightened turtle.

“What are you worried about?** 
V-Stephens said harshly. “They 
wouldn’t touch you — you*re an 
Earthman. I’m the one who should 
be sweating.” 

“They’re crazy,” LeMarr mut- 
tered. “All those morons chanting 
and marching — ” 

“They’re not morons,” Patterson 
answered mildly. “They’re just too 
trusting. They believe what they’re 
told, like the rest of us. The only 
trouble is, what they're told isn’t 
true.” He indicated one of the 
gigantic banners, a vast 3-D photo- 
graph that twisted and turned as it 
was carried forward. “Blame him. 
He’s the one who thinks up the lies. 
He’s the one who puts the pressure 
on the Directorate, fabricates the 
hate and violence — and has the 
funds to sell it.” 

The banner showed a stem- 
browed white-haired gentleman, 
clean-shaven and dignified. A 
scholarly man, heavy-set, in his late 
fifties. Kindly blue eyes, firm jaw- 
line, an impressive and respected 
dignitary. Under his handsome por- 
trait was his personal slogan, coined 
in a moment of inspiration. 

ONLY TRAITORS COMPROMISE! 

“That’s Francis Gannet,” V- 
Stephens said to LeMarr. “Fine fig- 
ure of a man, isn’t he?” He cor- 
rected himself. “Of an £ar^/iman.” 
“He looks so genteel,” Evelyn 
Cutter protested. “How could an 
intelligent-looking man like that 
have anything to do with this?” 
V-Stephens bellowed with taut 
laughter. “His nice clean white 
hands are a lot filthier than any of 
those plumbers and carpenters 
marching out there.” 

“But why—” 



“Gannet and his group own 
Transplan Industries, a holding 
company that controls most of the 
export-import business of the inner 
worlds. If my people and the Mar- 
tian people are given their inde- 
pendence they’ll start cutting into 
his trade. They’ll be competition. 
But as it stands, they’re bottled up 
in a cold-decked mercantile sys- 
tem.” 

The demonstrators had reached 
an intersection. A group of them 
dropped their banners and sprouted 
clubs and rocks. They shouted or- 
ders, waved the others on, and then 
headed grimly for a small modem 
building that blinked the word 
COLOR-AD in neon lights. 

“Oh, God,” Patterson said. 
“They’re after the Color-Ad of- 
fice.” He grabbed at the door han- 
dle, but V-Stephens stopped him. 

“You can’t do anything,” 
V-Stephens said. “Anyhow, no- 
body’s in there. They usually get 
advance warning.” 

The rioters smashed the plate- 
plastic windows and poured into 
the swank little store. The police 
sauntered over, arms folded, enjoy- 
ing the spectacle. From the ruined 
front office, smashed furniture was 
tossed out onto the sidewalk. Files, 
desks, chairs, vidscreens, ashtrays, 
even gay posters of happy life on 
the inner worlds. Acrid black fin- 
gers of smoke curled up as the 
store room was ignited by a hot- 
beam. Presently the rioters came 
streaming back out, satiated and 
happy. 

Along the sidewalks, people 
watched with a variety of emotions. 
Some showed delight. Some a 
vague curiosity. But most showed 
fear and dismay. They backed hur-

PHILIP K. DICK 




riedly away as th6 wild-faced riot- 
ers pushed brutally past them, 
loaded down with stolen goods. 

“See?” Patterson said. “This stuff 
is done by a few thousand, a Com- 
mittee Gannet’s financing. Those 
in front are employees of Gannet’s 
factories, goon squads on extra- 
curricular duty. They try to sound 
like Mankind, but they aren’t. 
They’re a noisy minority, a small 
bunch of hard-working fanatics.” 

The demonstration was breaking 
up. The Color-Ad office was a dis- 
mal fire-gutted ruin; traffic had 
been stopped; most of downtown 
New York had seen the lurid 
slogans and heard the tramp of 
feet and shouted hate. People be- 
gan drifting back into offices and 
shops, back to their daily routine. 

And then the rioters saw the 
Venusian girl, crouched in the 
locked and bolted doorway. 



P ATTERSON gimned the car 
forward. Bucking and grinding 
savagely, it hurtled across the street 
and up on the sidewalk, toward 
the running knot of dark-faced 
hoods. The nose of the car caught 
the first wave of them and tossed 
them like leaves. The rest collided 
with the metal hull and tumbled 
down in a shapeless mass of strug- 
gling arms and legs. 

The Venusian girl saw the car 
sliding toward her — and the Earth- 
people in the front seat. For a mo- 
ment she crouched in paralyzed 
terror. Then she turned and scur- 
ried off in panic, down the side- 
walk and into the milling throng 
that filled up the street. The rioters 
regrouped themselves and in an 
instant were after her in full cry. 

WAR VETERAN 



“Get the webfoot!” 

“Webfoots back to their own 
planet!” 

“Earth for Earthmen!” 

And beneath the chanted 
slogans, the ugly undercurrent of 
imverbalized lust and hate. 

Patterson backed the car up and 
onto the street. His fist clamped 
savagely over the horn, he gunned 
the car after the girl, abreast with 
the loping rioters and then past 
them. A rock crashed off the rear- 
view window and for an instant a 
hail of rubbish banged and clat- 
tered. Ahead, the crowd separated 
aimlessly, leaving an open path for 
the car and the rioters. No hand 
was lifted against the desperately 
running girl as she raced sobbing 
and panting between parked cars 
and groups of people. And nobody 
made a move to help her. Every- 
body watched dull-eyed and de- 
tached. Remote spectators viewing 
an event in which they had no 
part. 

“I’ll get her,” V-Stephens said. 
“Pull up in front of her and I’ll 
head her off.” 

Patterson passed the girl and 
jammed on the brakes. The girl 
doubled off the street like a terri- 
fied hare. V-Stephens was out of 
the car in a single bound. He 
sprinted after her as she darted 
mindlessly back toward the rioters. 
He swept her up and then plunged 
back to the car. LeMarr and Ev- 
elyn Cutter dragged the two of 
them in; and Patterson sent the 
car bucking ahead. 

A moment later he turned a cor- 
ner, snapped a police rope, and 
passed beyond the danger zone. 
The roar of people, the flap-flap of 
feet against the pavement, died 

9 




down behind them. 

“It’s all right,” V-Stephens was 
saying gently and repeatedly to the 
girl. “We’re friends. Look, I’m a 
webfoot, too.” 

The girl was huddled against the 
door of the car, green eyes wide 
with terror, thin face convulsed, 
knees pulled up against her stom- 
ach. She was perhaps seventeen 
years old. Her webbed fingers 
scrabbled aimlessly with the tom 
collar of her blouse. One shoe was 
missing. Her face was scratched, 
dark hair dishevelled. From her 
tremblmg^ mouth only vague sounds 
came/ 

LeMarr took her pulse. “Her 
heart’s about to pop out of her,” 
he muttered. From his coat he took 
an emergency capsule and shot a 
narcotic into the girl’s trembling 
forearm. “That’ll relax her. She’s 
not harmed — they didn’t get to 
her.” 

“It’s all right/’ V-Stephens mur- 
mured. “We’re doctors from the 
City Hospital, all but Miss Cutter 
who manages the files and records. 
Dr. LeMarr is a neurologist. Dr. 
Patterson is a cancer specialist, I’m 
a surgeon — see my hand?” He 
traced the girl’s forehead with his 
surgeon’s hand. “And I’m a Venu- 
sian, like you. We’ll take you to 
the hospital and keep you there for 
awhile.” 

‘T)id you see them?” LeMarr 
sputtered. “Nobody lifted a finger 
to help her. They just stood there.” 

“They were afraid,” Patterson 
said, “They want to avoid trou- 
ble.” 

“They can’t,” Evelyn Cutter said 
flatly. “Nobody can avoid this kind 
of trouble. They can’t keep stand- 
ing on the sidelines watching. This 

10 



isn’t a football game.” 

“What’s going to happen?” the 
girl quavered. 

“You better get off Earth,” 
V-Stephens said gently. “No Venu- 
sian is safe here. Get back to your 
own planet and stay there until this 
thing dies down.” 

“Will it?” the girl gasped. 
“Eventually.” V-Stephens 
reached down and passed her 
Evelyn’s cigarette. “It can’t go on 
like this. We have to be free.” 
“Take it easy,” Evelyn said in a 
dangerous voice. Her eyes faded to 
hostile coals. “I thought you were 
above all this.” 

V-Stephens dark green face 
flushed. “You think I can stand 
idly by while my people are killed 
and insulted, and our interests 
passed over, ignored so paste-faces 
like Gannet can get rich on blood 
squeezed from — ” 

“Paste-face,” LeMarr echoed 
wonderingly. “What’s that mean, 
Vachel?” 

“That’s their word for Earth- 
men,” Patterson answered. “Can it, 
V-Stephens. As far as we’re con- 
cerned it’s not your people and our 
people. We’re all the same race. 
Your ancestors were Earthmen 
who settled Venus back in the late 
twentieth century.” 

“The changes are only minor 
adaptive alterations,” LeMarr as- 
sured V-Stephens. “We can still 
interbreed — that proves we’re the 
same race.” 

“We can,” Evelyn Cutter said 
thinly. “But who wants to marry a 
webfoot or a crow?” 

Nobody said anything for awhile. 
The air in the car was tense with 
hostility as Patterson sped toward 
the hospital. The Venusian girl sat 

PHILIP K. DICK 




crouched, smoking silently, her ter- 
rified eyes on the vibrating floor. 

Patterson slowed down at the 
check-point and showed his i.d. tab. 
The hospital guard signalled the 
car ahead and he picked up speed. 
As he put his tab away his fingers 
touched something clipped to the 
inside of his pocket. Sudden mem- 
ory returned. 

“Here’s something to take your 
mind off your troubles,” he said to 
V-Stephens. He tossed the sealed 
tube back to the webfoot. “Mili- 
tary fired it back this morning. 
Clerical error. When you’re through 
with it hand it over to Evelyn. It’s 
supposed to go to her, but I got in- 
terested.” 

V-Stephens slit open the tube 
and spilled out the contents. It was 
a routine application for admission 
to a Government hospital, stamped 
with the number of a war-veteran. 
Old sweat-grimed tapes, papers 
torn and mutilated throughout the 
years. Greasy bits of metal foil that 
had been folded and refolded, 
stuffed in a shirt pocket, carried 
next to some filthy, hair-maUed 
chest. “Is this important?” V- 
Stephens asked impatiently. “Do 
we have to worry over clerical 
trifles?” 

Patterson halted the car in the 
hospital parking lot and turned off 
the motor. “Look at the number 
on the application,” he said, as he 
pushed open the car door. “When 
you have time to examine it you’ll 
find something unusual. The ap- 
plicant is carrying around an old 
veteran’s i.d. card — with a number 
that hasn’t been issued yet.” 

LeMarr, hopelessly baffled, 
looked from Evelyn Cutter to V- 
Stephens, but got no explanation. 

WAR VETERAN 



T he old man’s h-loop awoke 
him from a fitful slumber. 
“David Unger,” the tinny female 
voice repeated. “You are wanted 
back at the hospital. It is requested 
that you return to the hospital im- 
mediately.” 

The old man grunted and pulled 
himself up with an effort. Grab- 
bing his aluminum cane he hobbled 
away from his sweat-shiny bench, 
toward the escape ramp of the 
park. Just when he was getting to 
sleep, shutting out the too-bright 
sun and the shrill laughter of chil- 
dren and girls and young sol- 
diers. 

At the edge of the park two 
shapes crept furtively into the 
bushes. David Unger halted and 
stood in disbelief, as the shapes 
glided past him along the path. 

His voice surprised him. He was 
screaming at the top of his lungs, 
shrieks of rage and revulsion that 
echoed through the park, among 
the quiet trees and lawns. 
foots!*^ he wailed. He began to run 
clumsily after them. “Webfoots 
and crows! Help! Somebody help!” 
Waving his aluminum cane, he 
hobbled after the Martian and 
Venusian, panting wildly. People 
appeared, blank-faced with aston- 
ishment. A crowd formed, as the 
old man hurried after the terrified 
pair. Exhausted, he stumbled 
against a drinking fountain and 
half-fell, his cane sliding from his 
fingers. His shrunken face was 
livid; the burn-scar stood out sick 
and ugly against the mottled skin. 
His good eye was red with hate 
and fury. From his wasted lips 
saliva drooled. He waved his skinny 
claw-like hands futilely, as the two 
altereds crept into the grove of 

11 




cedars toward the far end of the 
park. 

“Stop them!” David Unger slob- 
bered. “Don’t let them get away! 
What’s the matter with you? You 
bunch of lily-white cowards. What 
kind of men are you?” 

“Take it easy. Pop,” a young sol- 
dier said good-naturedly. “They’re 
not hurting anybody.” 

Unger retrieved his cane and 
whooshed it past the soldier’s head. 
“You — talker” he snapped. “What 
kind of a soldier are you?” A fit of 
coughing choked off his words; he 
bent double, struggling to breathe. 
“In my day,” he managed to gasp, 
“we poured rocket fuel on them 
and strung them up. We mutilated 
them. We cut up the dirty webfoots 
and crows. We showed them.” 

A looming cop had stopped the 
pair of altereds. “Get going,” he 
ordered ominously. “You things 
got no right here.” 

The two altereds scuttled past 
him. The cop leisurely raised his 
stick and cracked the Martian 
across the eyes. The brittle, thin- 
shelled head splintered, and the 
Martian careened on, blinded and 
in agony. 

“That’s more like it,” David 
Unger gasped, in weak satisfaction. 

“You evil dirty old man,” a 
woman muttered at him, face white 
with horror. “It’s people like you 
that make all this trouble.” 

“What are you?” Unger 
snapped. “A crow-lover?” 

The crowd melted and broke. 
Unger, grasping his cane, stumbled 
toward the exit ramp, muttering 
curses and abuse, spitting violent- 
ly into the bushes and shaking his 
head. 

He arrived at the hospital 



groimds still trembling with rage 
and resentment. “What do you 
want?” he demanded, as he came 
up to the big receiving desk in the 
center of the main lobby. “I don’t 
know what’s going on around here. 
First you wake me out of the first 
real sleep I’ve had since I got here, 
and then what do I see but two 
webfoots walking around in broad 
daylight, sassy as — ” 

“Doctor Patterson wants you,” 
the nurse said patiently. “Room 
301.” She nodded to a robot. “Take 
Mr. Unger down to 301.” 

The old man hobbled sullenly 
after the smoothly-gliding robot. “I 
thought all you tinmen were used 
up in the Europa battle of ’88,” he 
complained. “It don’t make sense, 
all these lily-white boys in 
uniforms. Everybody wandering 
around having a good time, laugh- 
ing and diddling girls with nothing 
better to do than lie aroimd on the 
grass naked. Something’s the mat- 
ter. Something must be — ” 

“In here, sir,” the robot said, 
and the door of 301 slid away. 

Vachel Patterson rose slightly as 
the old man entered and stood 
fuming and gripping his aluminum 
cane in front of the work-desk. It 
was the first time he had seen 
David Unger face to face. Each of 
them sized the other up intently; 
the thin hawk-faced old soldier and 
the well-dressed young doctor, 
black thinning hair, hom-rimmed 
glasses and good-natured face. Be- 
side his desk Evelyn Cutter stood 
watching and listening impassive- 
ly, a cigarette between her red 
lips, blonde hair swept back. 

“I’m Doctor Patterson, and this 
is Miss Gutter.” Patterson toyed 
with the dog-eared, eroded tape 

PHILIP K. DICK

strewn across his ^esk. “Sit down, 
Mr. Unger. I want to ask you a 
couple of questions. Some uncer- 
tainty has come up regarding one 
of your papers. A routine error, 
probably, but they’ve come back to 
me. 

Unger seated himself warily. 
“Questions and red tape. Fve been 
here a week and every day it’s 
something. Maybe I should have 
just laid there in the street and 
died.” 

“You’ve been here eight days, 
according to this.” 

“I suppose so. If it says so there, 
must be true.” The old man’s thin 
sarcasm boiled out viciously. 
“Couldn’t put it down if it wasn’t 
true.” 

“You were admitted as a war 
veteran. All costs of care and main- 
tenance are covered by the Direc- 
torate.” 

Unger bristled. “What’s wrong 
with that? I earned a little care.” 
He leaned toward Patterson and 
jabbed a crabbed finger at him. “I 
was in the Service when I was six- 
teen. Fought and worked for Earth 
all my life. Would be there yet, if 
I hadn’t been half killed by that 
dirty mop-up attack of theirs. 
Lucky to be alive at all.” He self- 
consciously rubbed the livid ruin 
of his face. “Looks like you weren’t 
even in it. Didn’t know there was 
any place got by.” 

Patterson and Evelyn Cutter 
looked at each other. “How old are 
you?” Evelyn asked suddenly. 

“Don’t it say?” Unger muttered 
furiously. “Eighty-nine.” 

“And the year of your birth?” 
“2154. Can’t you fi^re that?” 
Patterson made a faint notation 
on the metal foil reports. “And 

WAR VETERAN 



your unit?” 

At that, Unger broke loose. “The 
Ba-3, if maybe you’ve heard of it. 
Although the way things are 
around here, I wonder if you know 
there was ever a war.” 

“The Ba-3,” Patterson repeated. 
“And you served with them how 
long?” 

“Fifty years. Then I retired. The 
first time, I mean. I was sixty-six 
years old. Usual age. Got my pen- 
sion and bit of land.” 

“And they called you back?” 
“Of course they called me back! 
Don’t you remember how the Ba-3 
went back into the line, all us old 
guys, and damn near stopped them, 
that last time? You must have been 
just a kid, but everybody knows 
what we did.” Unger fumbled out 
his Crystal Disc first class and 
slammed it on the desk. “I got that. 
All us survivors did. All ten of us, 
out of thirty thousand.” He gath- 
ered the medal up with shaking 
fingers. “I was hurt bad. You see 
my face. Burned, when Nathan 
West’s battleship blew up. I was in 
the military hospital for a couple 
years. That was when they cracked 
Earth wide open.” The ancient 
hands clenched into futile fists. 
“We had to sit there, watching 
them turn Earth into a smoking 
ruin. Nothing but slag and ash, 
miles of death. No towns, no cities. 
We sat there, while their C-missiles 
whizzed by. Finally they got fin- 
ished — ^and got us on Luna, too.” 
Evelyn Cutter tried to speak, but 
no words came. At his work-desk 
Patterson’s face had turned chalk- 
white. “Continue,” he managed to 
mutter. “Go on talking.” 

“We hung on there, subsurface, 
down under the Copernicus crater, 

13 




while they slammed their C-missiles 
into us. We held out maybe five 
years. Then they started landing. 
Me and those still left took off in 
high-speed attack torpedoes. Set up 
pirate bases among the outer plan- 
ets.” Unger twitched restlessly. “I 
hate to talk about that part. De- 
feat, the end of everything. Why 
do you ask me? I helped build 3-4- 
9-5, the best artibase of the lot. Be- 
tween Uranus and Neptune. Then 
I retired again. Until the dirty rats 
slid in and leisurely blew it to bits. 
Fifty thousand men, women, kids. 
The whole colony.” 

“You escaped?” Evelyn Cutter 
whispered. 

“Of course I escaped! I was on 
patrol. I got one of those webfoot 
ships. Shot it down and watched 
them die. It made me feel a little 
better. I moved over to 3-6-7-7 for 
a few years. Until it was attacked. 
That was early this month. I was 
fighting with my back to the wall.” 
The dirty yellow teeth glinted in 
agony. “No place to escape to, that 
time. None that I knew of.” The 
red-rimmed eye surveyed the lux- 
urious office. “Didn’t know about 
this. You people sure done a good 
job fBdng up your artibase. Looks 
almost like I remember the real 
Earth. A little too fast and bright; 
not so peaceful as Earth really was. 
But you even got the smell of the 
air the same.” 

There was silence. 

“Then you came here after — that 
colony was destroyed?” Patterson 
asked hoarsely. 

“I guess.” Unger shrugged weari- 
ly. “Last I remember was the bub- 
ble shattering and the air and heat 
and grav leaking out. Crow and 
webfoot ships landing everywhere, 

14 



Men dying around me. I was 
knocked out by the concussion. 
The next thing I knew I was lying 
out in the street here, and some 
people were getting me to my feet. 
A tinman and one of your doctors 
too'k me here.” 

Patterson let out a deep shud- 
dering breath. “I see.” His fingers 
plucked aimlessly at the eroded, 
sweat-grimed i.d. papers. “Well, 
that explains this irregularity.” 
“Ain’t it all there? Is something 
missing?” 

“All your papers are here. Your 
tube was hanging around your 
wrist when they brought you in.” 
“Naturally.” Unger’s bird-like 
chest swelled with pride. “I learned 
that when I was sixteen. Even 
when you’re dead you have to have 
that tube with you. Important to 
keep the records straight.” 

“The records are straight,” Pat- 
terson admitted thickly. “You can 
go back to your room. Or the park. 
Anywhere.” He waved and the 
robot calmly escorted the withered 
old man from the office and out 
into the hall. 

As the door slid shut Evelyn 
Cutter began swearing slowly and 
monotonously. She crushed out her 
cigarette with her sharp heel and 
paced wildly back and forth. “Good 
God what have we got ourselves 
into?” 

Patterson snatched up the inter- 
vid, dialed outside, and said to the 
supraplan monitor, “Get me mili- 
tary headquarters. Right away.” 
“At Luna, sir?” 

“That’s right,” Patterson said. 
“At the main base on Luna.” 

On the wall of the office, past 
the taut, pacing figure of Evelyn 
Cutter, the calendar read August 4, 

PHILIP K. DICK 




2169. If David Unger was bom in 
2154 he would be a boy of fifteen. 
And he had been bom in 2154. It 
said so on his battered, yellowed, 
sweat-stained cards. On the i.d. pa- 
pers carried through a war that 
hadn’t yet happened. 



H E’S A VETERAN, all right,” 
Patterson said to V-Stephens. 
“Of a war that won’t begin for an- 
other month. No wonder his appli- 
cation was turned back by the IBM 
machines.” 

V-Stephens licked his dark green 
lips. “This war will be between 
Earth and the two colony planets. 
And Earth will lose?” 

“Unger fought through the whole 
war. He saw it from the start to 
finish — to the total destruction of 
Earth.” Patterson paced over to 
the window and gazed out. “Earth 
lost the war and the race of Earth- 
men was wiped out.” 

From the window of V-Stephens’ 
office, Patterson could see the city 
spread out. Miles of buildings, 
white and gleaming in the late- 
aftemoon sun. Eleven million peo- 
ple. A gigantic center of commerce 
and industry, the economic hub of 
the system. And beyond it, a world 
of cities and farms and highways, 
three billion men and women. A 
thriving, healthy planet, the mother 
world from which the altereds had 
originally spmng, the ambitious set- 
tlers of Venus and Mars. Endless 
cargo carriers lumbered between 
Earth and the colonies, weighed 
down with minerals and ores and 
produce. And already, survey teams 
were poking around the outer 
planets, laying claim in the Direc- 
torate’s name to new sources of 



raw-materials. 

“He saw all this go up in radio- 
active dust,” Patterson said. “He 
saw the final attack on Earth that 
broke our defenses. And then they 
wiped out the Lunar base.” 

“You say some brass hats are on 
their way here from Luna?” 

“I gave them enough of the story 
to start them moving. It usually 
takes weeks to stir up those fel- 
lows.” 

“I’d like to see this Unger,” 
V-Stephens said thoughtfully. “Is 
there some way I can — ” 

“You’ve seen him. You revived 
him, remember? When he was 
originally found and brought in.” 
“Oh,” V-Stephens said softly. 
“That filthy old man?” His dark 
eyes flickered. “So that’s Unger, . 
The veteran of the war we’re going 
to fight.” 

“The war you’re going to win. 
The war Earth is going to lose.” 
Patterson abruptly left the window. 
“Unger thinks this is an artificial 
satellite someplace between Uranus 
and Neptune. A reconstruction of 
a small part of New York — a few 
thousand people and machines un- 
der a plastic dome. He has no con- 
ception of what’s actually hap- 
pened to him. Somehow, he must 
have been hurled back along his 
time-track.” 

“I suppose the release of energy 
. And maybe his frantic desire to 
escape. But even so, the whole 
thing is fantastic. It has a sort of 
— ” V-Stephens groped for the 
word, “a sort of mystic ring to it. 
What the hell is this, a visitation? 
A prophet from heaven?” 

The door opened and V-Rafia 
slid in. “Oh,” she said, as she saw 
Patterson, “I didn’t know — ” 



WAR VETERAN

“That’s all right.” V-Stephens 
nodded her inside his office. “You 
remember Patterson. He was with 
us in the car when we picked you 
up.” 

V-Rafia looked much better 
than she had a few hours before. 
Her face was no longer scratched, 
her hair was back in place, and she 
had changed to a crisp gray sweater 
and skirt. Her green skin sparkled 
as she moved over beside V- 
Stephens, still nervous and appre- 
hensive. “I’m staying here,” she 
said defensively to Patterson. “I 
can’t go back out there, not for 
awhile.” She darted a quick glance 
of appeal at V-Stephens. 

“She has no family on Earth,” 
V-Stephens explained. “She came 
here as a Glass-2 biochemist. She’s 
been working over at a Westing- 
house lab outside Chicago. She 
came to New York on a shopping 
trip, which was a mistake.” 

“Can’t she join the V-colony at 
Denver?” Patterson asked. 

V-Stephens flushed. “You don’t 
want another webfoot around 
here?” 

“What can she do? We’re not an 
embattled fortress. There’s no rea- 
son why we can’t shoot her to Den- 
ver in a fast freight rocket. No- 
body’ll interfere with that.” 

“We can discuss it later,” V- 
Stephens said irritably. “We’ve got 
more important things to talk 
about. You’ve made a check of 
Unger’s papers? You’re certain 
they’re not forgeries? I suppose it’s 
possible this is on the level, but we 
have to be certain.” 

“This has to be kept quiet,” Pat- 
terson said urgently, with a glance 
at V-Rafia. “Nobody on the out- 
side should be brought in.” 

16 



“You mean me?” V-Rafia asked 
hesitantly. “I guess I better leave.” 

“Don’t leave,” V-Stephens said, 
grabbing hold of her arm roughly. 
“Patterson, you can’t keep this 
quiet. Unger’s probably told it to 
ffity people ; he sits out there on his 
park bench all day, buttonholing 
everybody who passes.” 

“What is this?” V-Rafia asked 
curiously. 

“Nothing important,” Patterson 
said wamingly. 

“Nothing important?” V- 
Stephens echoed. “Just a little war. 
Programs for sale in advance.” 
Across his face a spasm of emotion 
passed, excitement and yearning 
hunger pouring up from inside 
him. “Place your bets now. Don’t 
take chances. Bet on a sure thing, 
sweetheart. After all, it’s history. 
Isn’t that right?” He turned to- 
ward Patterson, his expression de- 
manding confirmation. “What do 
you say? I can’t stop it — ^you can’t 
stop it. Right?” 

Patterson nodded slowly. “I 
guess you’re right,” he said unhap- 
pily. And swung with all his 
strength. 

He caught V-Stephens slightly 
to one side, as the Venusian scram- 
bled away. V-Stephens’ cold-beam 
came out; he aimed with shaky 
fingers. Patterson kicked it from his 
hands and dragged him to his feet. 
“It was a mistake, John,” he 
panted. “I shouldn’t have showed 
you Unger’s i.d. tube. I shouldn’t 
have let you know.” 

“That’s right,” V-Stephens man- 
aged to whisper. His eyes were 
blank with sorrow as he focussed 
on Patterson. “Now I know. Now 
we both know. You^re going to lose 
the war. Even if you lock Unger up 

PHILIP K. DICK 




in a box and sink him to the center 
of the Earth it’s too late. Color-Ad 
will know as soon as I’m out of 
here.” 

“They burned down the Color- 
Ad office in New York.” 

“Then I’ll find the one in Chi- 
cago. Or Baltimore. I’ll fly back to 
Venus, if I have to. I’m going to 
spread the good news. It’ll be hard 
and long, but we’ll win. And you 
can’t do anything about it.” 

“I can kill you,” Patterson said. 
His mind was racing frantically. It 
wasn’t too late. If V-Stephens were 
contained, and David Unger turned 
over to the Military — 

‘T know what you’re thinking,” 
V-Stephens gasped. “If Earth 
doesn’t fight, if you avoid war, you 
may still have a chance.” His green 
lips twisted savagely. “You think 
we’d let you avoid war? Not now! 
Only traitors compromise, accord- 
ing to you. Now it’s too late!” 
“Only too late,” Patterson said, 
“if you get out of here.” His hand 
groped on the desk and found a 
steel paper weight. He drew it to 
him — and felt the smooth tip of 
the cold-beam in his ribs. 

“I’m not sure how this thing 
works,” V-Rafia said slowly, “but I 
guess there’s only this one button 
to press.” 

“That’s right,” V-Stephens said, 
with relief. “But don’t press it yet. 
I want to talk to him a few min- 
utes more. Maybe he can be 
brought around to rationality.” He 
pulled himself gratefully out of 
Patterson’s grip and moved back a 
few paces, exploring his cut lip and 
broken front teeth. “You brought 
this on yourself, Vachel.” 

“This is insane,” Patterson 
snapped, his eyes on the snout of 

WAR VETERAN 



the cold-beam as it wavered in 
V-Rafia’s uncertain fingers. “You 
expect us to fight a war we know 
we’re going to lose?” 

“You won’t have a choice.” 
V-Stephens’ eyes gleamed. “We’ll 
make you fight. When we attack 
your cities you’ll come back at^us. 
It’s — ^human nature.” 

The first blast of the cold-beam 
missed Patterson. He floundered to 
one side and grabbed for the girl’s 
slim wrist. His fingers caught air, 
and then he was down, as the beam 
hissed again. V-Rafia retreated, 
eyes wide with fright and dismay, 
aiming blindly for his rising body. 
He leaped up, hands extended for 
the terrified girl. He saw her fin- 
gers twist, saw the snout of the tube 
darken as the field clicked on. And 
that W2W all. 

From the kicked-open door, the 
blue-clad soldiers caught V-Rafia 
in a crossfire of death. A chill 
breath mushroomed in Patterson’s 
face. He collapsed back, arms up 
frantically, as the frigid whisper 
glided past him. 

V-Rafia’s trembling body danced 
briefly, as the cloud of absolute cold 
glowed around her. Then abruptly 
she halted as rigid as if the tape- 
track of her life had stopped in the 
projector. All color drained from 
her body. The bizarre imitation of 
a still-standing human figure stood 
silently, one arm raised, caught in 
the act of futile defense. 

Then the frozen pillar burst. The 
expanded cells ruptured in a 
shower of crystalline particles that 
were hurled sickeningly into every 
part of the office. 

Francis Gannet moved cautious- 
ly in behind the troops, red-faced 
and perspiring. “You’re Patter- 

17 




son?” he demanded. He held out 
his heavy hand, but Patterson 
didn’t take it. “The Military peo- 
ple notified me as a matter of 
course. Where’s this old man?” 
“Somewhere around,” Patterson 
muttered. “Under guard.” He 
turned toward V-Stephens and 
briefly their eyes met. “You see?” 
he said huskily. “This is what hap- 
pens. Is this what you really want?” 
“Come on, Mr. Patterson,” Fran- 
cis Gannet boomed impatiently. “I 
don’t have much time to waste. 
From your description this sounds 
like something important.” 

“It is,” V-Stephens answered 
calmly. He wiped at the trickle of 
mouth-blood with his pocket hand- 
kerchief. “It’s worth the trip from 
Luna. Take my word for it — 1 
know/^ 



T he man who sat on Gannet’s 
right was a lieutenant. He 
gazed in mute awe at the vid- 
screen. His young, handsome blond 
face was alive with amazement as 
from the bank of gray haze a huge 
battleship lumbered, one reactor 
smashed, its forward turrets crum- 
pled, hull twisted open. 

“Good God,” Lieutenant Nathan 
West said faintly. “That’s the 
Wind Giant. The biggest battleship 
we have. Look at it — it’s out of 
commission. Totally disabled.” 
“That will be your ship,” Pat- 
terson said. “You’ll be Commander 
of it in ’87 when it’s destroyed by 
the combined Venusian and Mar- 
tian fleets. David Unger will be 
serving under you. You’ll be killed, 
but Unger will escape. The few 
survivors of your ship will watch 
from Luna as Earth is systematical- 

18 



ly demolished by C-missiles from 
Venus and Mars.” 

On the screen, the figures leaped 
and swirled like fish in the bottom 
of a dirt-saturated tank. A violent 
maelstrom surged in the center, a 
vortex of energy that lashed the 
ships in vast spasms of motion. The 
silver Earth ships hesitated, then 
broke. Flashing black Mars battle- 
ships swept through the wide 
breach — and the Earth flank was 
turned simultaneously by the wait- 
ing Venusians. Together, they 
caught the remnants of the Earth 
ships in a steel pincers and 
crunched them out of existence. 
Brief puffs of light, as the ships 
winked out of being. In the dis- 
tance, the solemn blue and green 
orb that was Earth slowly and ma- 
jestically revolved. 

Already, it showed ugly pocks. 
Bomb craters from the C-missiles 
that had penetrated the defense 
network. 

LeMarr snapped off the projec- 
tor and the screen died. “That ends 
that brain-sequence. All we can 
get are visual fragments like this, 
brief instants that left strong im- 
pressions on him. We can’t get con- 
tinuity. The next one takes up 
years later, on one of the artificial 
satellites.” 

The lights came on, and the 
group of spectators moved stiffly to 
their feet. Gannet’s face was a sick- 
ly putty-gray. “Doctor LeMarr, I 
want to see that shot again. That 
one of Earth.” He gestured help- 
lessly. “You know which one I 
mean.” 

The lights dimmed and again 
the screen came to life. This time 
it showed only Earth, a receding 
orb that fell behind as the high- 

PHILIP K. DICK - 




velocity torpedo on which David 
Unger rode hurtled toward outer 
space. Unger had placed himself 
so his dead world would be visible 
to the last. 

Earth was a ruin. Involuntarily, 
a gasp rose from the group of 
watching officers. Nothing lived. 
Nothing moved. Only dead clouds 
of radioactive ash billowed aimless- 
ly over the crater-pocked surface. 
What had been a living planet of 
three billion people was a charred 
cinder of ash. Nothing remained 
but heaps of debris, dispersed and 
blown dismally across vacant seas 
by the howling, ceaseless wind. 

“I suppose some kind of vege- 
table life will take over,” Evelyn 
Cutter said harshly, as the screen 
faded and the overhead lights re- 
turned. She shuddered violently 
and turned away. 

“Weeds, maybe,” LeMarr said. 
“Dark dry weeds poking up 
through the slag. Maybe some in- 
sects, later on. Bacteria, of course. 
I suppose in time bacterial action 
will transform the ash into usable 
soil. And it’ll rain for a billion 
years.” 

“Let’s face it,” Gannet said. 
“The webfoots and crows will re- 
settle it. They’ll be living here on 
Earth after we’re all dead.” 

“Sleeping in our beds?” LeMarr 
inquired mildly. “Using our bath- 
rooms and sitting in the public 
waiting rooms and transports?” 

“I don’t understand you,” Gan- 
net answered impatiently. He 
waved Patterson over. “You’re sure 
nobody knows but we here in this 
room?” 

“V-Stephens knows,” Patterson 
said. “But he’s locked up in the 
psychotic ward. V-Rafia knew. 

WAR VETERAN 



She’s dead.” 

Lieutenant West came over to 
Patterson. “Could we interview 
him?” 

“Yes, where’s Unger?” Gannet 
demanded. “My staff is eager to 
meet him face to face.” 

“You have all the essential 
facts,” Patterson answered. “You 
know how the war is going to come 
out. You know what’s going to 
happen to Earth.” 

“What do you suggest?” Gannet 
asked warily. 

“Avoid the war.” 

Gannet shrugged his plump well- 
fed body. “After all, you can’t 
change history. And this is future 
history. We have no choice but to 
go ahead and fight.” 

“At least we’ll get our share of 
them,” Evelyn Cutter said icily. 

“What are you talking about?” 
LeMarr stuttered excitedly. “You 
work in a hospital and you talk 
like that?” 

The woman’s eyes blazed. “You 
saw what they did to Earth. You 
saw them cut us to ribbons.” 

“We have to stand above this,” 
LeMarr protested. “If we allow 
ourselves to get dragged into this 
hate and violence — ” He appealed 
to Patterson. “Why is V-Stephens 
locked up? He’s no crazier than 
she is.” 

“True,” Patterson agreed. “But 
she’s crazy on our side. We don’t 
lock up that kind of lunatic.” 
LeMarr moved away from him. 
“Are you going out and fight, too? 
Alongside Gannet and his sol- 
diers?” 

“I want to avoid the war,” Pat- 
terson said dully. 

“Can it be done?” Gannet de- 
manded. An avid glow winked 

19 




briefly behind his pale, blue eyes 
and then faded out. 

“Maybe it can be done. Why 
not? Unger coming back here adds 
a new element.” 

“If the future can be changed,” 
Gannet said slowly, “then maybe 
we have a choice of various possi- 
bilities. If there’re two possible 
futures there may be an infinite 
number. Each branching off at a 
different point.” A granite mask 
slid over his face. “We can use 
Unger’s knowledge of the battles.” 
“Let me talk to him,” Lieuten- 
ant West interrupted excitedly. 
“Maybe we can get a clear idea of 
the webfoot battle-strategy. He’s 
probably gone over the battles in 
his mind a thousand times.’,’ 

“He’d recognize you,” Gannet 
said. “After all, he served imder 
your command.” 

Patterson was deep in thought. 
“I don’t think so,” he said to West. 
“You’re a lot older than David 
Unger.” 

West blinked. “What do you 
mean? He’s a broken-down old 
man and I’m still in my twenties.” 
“David Unger is fifteen,” Pat- 
terson answered. “At this point 
you’re almost twice his age. You’re 
already a commissioned officer on 
the Lunar policy-level staff. Unger 
isn’t even in the Military Service. 
He’ll volunteer when war breaks 
out, as a buck private without ex- 
perience or training. When you’re 
an old man commanding the Wind 
Giant, David Unger will be a mid- 
dle-aged nonentity working one of 
the gun turrets, a name you won’t 
even know.” 

“Then Unger is already alive?” 
Gannet said, puzzled. 

“Unger is someplace around, 



waiting to step onto the stage.” 
Patterson filed the thought away 
for future study; it might have 
valuable possibilities. “I don’t think 
he’ll recognize you, West. He may 
never even have seen you. The 
Wing Giant is a big ship.” 

West quickly agreed. “Put a bug- 
system on me, Gannet. So the com- 
mand staff can have the aud and 
vid images of what Unger says.” 



THE bright mid-morning sun- 
light, David Unger sat moodily 
on his park bench, gnarled fingers 
gripping his aluminum cane, gaz- 
ing dully at the passers-by. 

To his right a robot gardener 
worked over the same patch of 
grass again and again, its metallic 
eye-lenses intently fastened on the 
wizened, hunched-over figure of 
the old man. Down the gravel path 
a group of loitering men sent ran- 
dom comments to the various mon- 
itors scattered through the park, 
keeping the relay system open. A 
bare-bosomed young woman sun- 
bathing by the pool nodded faintly 
to a pair of soldiers pacing around 
the park, within constant sight of 
David Unger. 

That morning there were a hun- 
dred people in the park. All were 
integrated elements of the screen 
surrounding the half-dozing, re- 
sentful old man. 

“All right,” Patterson said. His 
car was parked at the edge of the 
plot of green trees and lawns. “Re- 
member not to overexcite him. 
V-Stephens revived him originally. 
If something goes wrong with his 
heart we can’t get V-Stephens to 
pump him back.” 

The blond young lieutenant 

PHILIP K. DICK 



20 




nodded, straightened his immacu- 
late blue tunic and slid onto the 
sidewalk. He pushed his helmet 
back and briskly strode down the 
gravel path, toward the center of 
the park. As he approached, the 
lounging figures moved impercepti- 
bly. One by one they took up posi- 
tions on the lawns, on the benches, 
in groups here and there aroimd 
the pool. 

Lieutenant West stopped at a 
drinking fountain and allowed the 
robot water-brain to find his mouth 
with a jet of ice-cold spray. He 
wandered slowly away and stood 
for a moment, arms loose at his 
sides, vacantly watching a young 
woman as she removed her clothes 
and stretched out languidly on a 
multi-colored blanket. Her eyes 
shut, red lips parted, the woman 
relaxed with a grateful sigh. 

“Let him speak to you first,” she 
said faintly, to the lieutenant stand- 
ing a few feet from her, one black 
boot on the edge of a bench. “Don’t 
start the conversation.” 

Lieutenant West watched her a 
moment longer and then continued 
along the path. A passing heavy-set 
man said swiftly in his ear, “Not so 
fast. Take your time and don’t ap- 
pear to hurry.” 

“You want to give the impres- 
sion you have all day,” a hatchet- 
faced nurse grated, as she passed 
him wheeling a baby carriage. 

Lieutenant West slowed almost 
to a halt. He aimlessly kicked a bit 
of gravel from the path into the 
wet bushes. Hands deep in his 
pockets he wandered over to the 
central pool and stood gazing ab- 
sently into its depths. He lit a cig- 
arette, then bought an ice cream 
bar from a passing robot salesman. 

WAR VETERAN 



“Spill some on your tunic, sir,” 
the robot’s speaker instructed faint- 
ly. “Swear and start dabbing at it.” 

Lieutenant West let die ice 
cream melt in the warm summer 
sun. When some had dripped down 
his wrist onto his starched blue 
tunic he scowled, dug out his hand- 
kerchief, dipped it in the pool, and 
began clumsily to wipe the ice 
cream away. 

On his bench, the scar-faced old 
man watched with his one good 
eye, gripping his aluminum cane 
and cackling happily. “Watch out,” 
he wheezed. “Look out there!” 

Lieutenant West glanced up in 
annoyance. 

“You’re dripping more,” the old 
man cackled, and lay back in weak 
amusement, toothless mouth slack 
with pleasure. 

Lieutenant West grinned good- 
naturedly. “I guess so,” he admit- 
ted. He dropped the melting half- 
eaten ice cream bar into a dis- 
posal slot and finished cleaning his 
tunic. “Sure is warm,” he observed, 
wandering vaguely over. 

“They do a good job,” Unger 
agreed, nodding his bird-like head. 
He peered and craned his neck, 
trying to make out the insignia 
markings on the young soldier’s 
shoulder. “You with the rock- 
eteers?” 

“Demolition,” Lieutenant West 
said. As of that morning his in- 
signia had been changed. “Ba-3.” 

The old man shuddered. He 
hawked and spat feverishly into 
the nearby bushes. “That so?” He 
half-rose, excited and fearful, as 
the lieutenant started to move 
away. “Say, you know, I was in 
the Ba-3 years ago.” He tried to 
make his voice sound calm and 



21 




casual. “Long before your time.” 
Amazement and disbelief slid 
over Lieutenant West’s handsome 
blond face. “Don’t kid me. Only a 
couple guys from the old group are 
still alive. You’re pulling my leg.” 
“I was, I was,” Unger wheezed, 
fumbling with trembling haste at 
his coat pocket. “Say, look at this. 
Stop a minute and I’ll show you 
something.” Reverent and awed, 
he held out his Crystal Disc. “See? 
You know what this is?” 

Lieutenant West gazed down at 
the medal a long time. Real emo- 
tion welled up inside him ; he didn’t 
have to counterfeit it. “Can I ex- 
amine it?” he asked finally. 

Unger hesitated. “Sure,” he said. 
“Take it.” 

Lieutenant West took the medal 
and held it for a long moment, 
weighing it and feeling its cold sur- 
face against his smooth skin. Final- 
ly he returned it. “You got that 
back in ’87?” 

“That’s right,” Unger said. “You 
remember?” He returned it to his 
pocket. “No, you weren’t even 
alive, then. But you heard about it, 
haven’t you?” 

“Yes,” West said. “I’ve heard 
about it many times.” 

“And you haven’t forgotten? A 
lot of people forgot that, what we 
did there.” 

“I guess we took a beating that 
day,” West said. He sat down slow- 
ly on the bench beside the old man. 
“That was a bad day for Earth.” 
“We lost,” Unger agreed. “Only 
a few of us got out of there. I got 
to Luna. I saw Earth go, piece by 
piece, until there was nothing left. 
It broke my heart. I cried until I 
lay like a dead thing. We were all 
weeping, soldiers, workmen, stand- 

22 



ing there helpless. And then they 
turned their missiles on us.” 

The lieutenant licked his dry lips. 
“Your Commander didn’t get out, 
did he?” 

“Nathan West died on his ship,” 
Unger said. “He was the finest 
Commander in the line. They 
didn’t give him the Wind Giant for 
nothing.” His ancient, withered 
features dimmed in recollection. 
“There’ll never be another man 
like West. I saw him, once. Big 
stem-faced man, wide-shouldered. 
A giant himself. He was a great old 
man. Nobody could have done bet- 
ter.” 

West hesitated. “You think if 
somebody else had been in com- 
mand — ” 

“No.'” Unger shrieked. “Nobody 
could have done better! I’ve heard 
it said — I know what some of those 
fat-bottomed armchair strategists 
say. But they’re wrong! Nobody 
could have won that battle. We 
didn’t have a chance. We were out^ 
numbered five to one — two huge 
fleets, one straight at our middle 
and the other waiting there like a 
hungry beast to chew us up and 
swallow us.” 

“I see,” West said thickly. Reluc- 
tantly he continued, in an agony of 
turmoil, “These armchair men, 
what the hell is it they say? I never 
listen to the brass.” He tried to grin 
but his face refused to respond. “I 
know they’re always saying we 
could have won the battle and may- 
be even saved the Wind Giant y but 
I—” 

“Look here,” Unger said fervent- 
ly, his sunken eye wild and glitter- 
ing. With the point of his alumi- 
num cane he began gouging harsh, 
violent ditches in the gravel by his 

PHILIP K. DICK 




feet. ‘‘This line is our fleet. Remem- 
ber how West had it drawn up? It 
was a mastermind arranged our 
fleet, that day. A genius. We held 
them off for twelve hours before 
they busted through. Nobody 
thought we’d have a chance of 
even doing that.” Savagely, Unger 
gouged another line. “That’s die 
crow fleet.” 

“I see,” West muttered. He 
leaned over so his chest-lens would 
vid the rough lines in the gravel 
back to the scanning center in the 
mobile unit circling lazily over- 
head. And from there to main 
headquarters on Luna. “And the 
webfoot fleet?” 

Unger glanced cagily at him, 
suddenly shy. “I’m not boring you, 
am I? I guess an old man likes to 
talk. Sometimes I bother people, 
trying to take up their time.” 

“Go on,” West answered. He 
meant what he said. “Keep draw- 
ing — Fm watching.” 



E velyn cutter paced rest- 
lessly around her softly-lit 
apartment, arms folded, red lips 
tight with anger. “I don’t under- 
stand you!” She paused to lower 
the heavy drapes. “You were will- 
ing to kill V-Stephens a little while 
ago. Now you won’t even help 
block LeMarr. You know LeMarr 
doesn’t grasp what’s happening. 
He dislikes Gannet and he prattles 
about the interplan community of 
scientists, our duty to all mankind 
and that sort of stuff. Can’t you see 
if V-Stephens gets hold of him — ” 
“Maybe LeMarr is right,” Pat- 
terson said. “I don’t like Gannet 
either.” 

Evelyn exploded. “They’ll de- 
WAR VETERAN 



stroy us! We can’t fight a war with 
them — we don’t have a chance.” 
She halted in front of him, eyes 
blazing. “But they don’t know that 
yet. We’ve got to neutralize Le- 
Marr, at least for awhile. Every 
minute he’s walking around free 
puts our world in jeopardy. Three 
billion lives depend on keeping this 
suppressed.” 

Patterson was brooding. “I sup- 
pose Gannet briefed you on the 
initial exploration West conducted 
today.” 

“No results so far. The old man 
knows every battle by heart, and 
we lost them all.” She rubbed her 
forehead wearily. “I mean, we will 
lose them all.” With numb fingers 
she gathered up the empty coffee 
cups. “Want some more coffee?” 

Patterson didn’t hear her ; he was 
intent on his own thoughts. He 
crossed over to the window and 
stood gazing out until she returned 
with fresh coffee, hot and black 
and steaming. 

“You didn’t see Gannet kill that 
girl,” Patterson said. 

“What girl? That webfoot?” 
Evelyn stirred sugar and cream into 
her coffee. “She was going to kill 
you. V-Stephens would have lit out 
for Color-Ad and the war would 
begin.” Impatiently, she pushed his 
coffee cup to him. “Anyhow, that 
was the girl we saved.” 

“I know,” Patterson said. “That’s 
why it bothers me.” He took the 
coffee automatically and sipped 
without tasting. “What was the 
point of dragging her from the 
mob? Gannet’ s mob. We’re doing 
Gannet’s work. We’re employees of 
Gannet.” 

“So?” 

“You know what kind of game 

23 

i 




he’s playing!” 

Evelyn shrugged. “I’m just be- 
ing practical. I don’t want Earth 
destroyed. Neither does Gannet — 
he wants to avoid the war.” 

“He wanted war a few days ago. 
When he expected to win.” 

Evelyn laughed sharply. “Of 
course! Who’d fight a war they 
knew they’d lose? That’s irra- 
tional.” 

“Now Gannet will hold off the 
war,” Patterson admitted slowly. 
“He’ll let the colony planets have 
their independence. He’ll recognize 
Color-Ad. He’ll destroy David 
Unger and everybody who knows. 
He’ll pose as a benevolent peace- 
maker.” 

“Of course. He’s already making 
plans for a dramatic trip to Venus. 
A last-minute conference with 
Color-Ad officials, to prevent war. 
He’ll put pressure on the Directo- 
rate to back down and let Mars and 
Venus sever. He’ll be the idol of 
the system. But isn’t that better 
than Earth destroyed and our race 
wiped out?” 

“Now the big machine turns 
around and roars against war.” 
Patterson’s lips twisted ironically. 
“Peace and compromise instead of 
hate and destructive violence.” 
Evelyn perched on the arm of a 
chair and made rapid calculations. 
“How old was David Unger when 
he joined the Military?” 

“Fifteen or sixteen.” 

“When a man joins the Service 
he gets his i.d. number, doesn’t 
he?” 

“That’s right. So?” 

“Maybe I’m wrong, but accord- 
ing to my figures — ” She glanced 
up. “Unger should appear and 
claim his number, soon. That num- 




24 



PHILIP K. DICK 



ber will be coming up any day, ac- 
cording to how fast Ae enlistments 
pour in.” 

A strange expression crossed 
Patterson’s face. “Unger is already 
alive. A fifteen year old kid. 
Unger the youth and Unger the 
senile old war veteran. Both alive 
at once.” 

Evelyn shuddered. “It’s weird. 
Suppose they ran into each other? 
There’ d be a lot of difference be- 
tween them.” 

In Patterson’s mind a picture of 
a bright-eyed youth of fifteen 
formed. Eager to get into the fight. 
Ready to leap in and kill webfoots 
and crows with idealistic enthusi- 
asm. At this moment, Unger was 
moving inexorably toward the re- 
cruiting office. And the half- 
blind, Clipped old relic of eighty- 
nine wretched years was creeping 
hesitantly from his hospital room 
to his park bench, hugging his alu- 
minum cane, whispering in his 
raspy, pathetic voice to anyone who 
would listen. 

“We’ll have to keep our eyes 
open,” Patterson said. “You bet- 
ter have somebody at Military no- 
tify you when that number comes 
up. When Unger appears to claim 
it.” 

Evelyn nodded. “It might be a 
good idea. Maybe we should re- 
quest the Census Department to 
make a check for us. Maybe we can 
locate — ” 

She broke off. The door of the 
apartment had swung silently open. 
Edwin LeMarr stood gripping the 
knob, blinking red-eyed in the half- 
light. Breathing harshly, he came 
into the room. “Vachel, I have to 
talk to you.” 

“What is it?” Patterson de- 
WAR VETERAN 



manded. “What’s going on?” 

LeMarr shot Evelyn a look of 
pure hate. “He found it. I knew he 
would. As soon as he can get it 
analyzed and the whole thing down 
on tape — ” 

“Gannet?” Cold fear knifed 
down Patterson’s spine. “Gannet 
found what?” 

“The moment of crisis. The old 
man’s babbling about a five-ship 
convoy. Fuel for the crow warfleet. 
Unescorted and moving toward the 
battle line. Unger says our scouts 
will miss it.” LeMarr’s breathing 
was hoarse and frenzied. “He says 
if we knew in advance — ” He 
pulled himself together with a vio- 
lent effort. “Then we could destroy 
it.” 

“I see,” Patterson said. “And 
throw the balance in Earth’s 
favor.” 

“If West can plot the convoy 
route,” LeMarr finished, “Earth 
will win the war. That means Gan- 
net will fight — as soon as he gets 
the exact information.” 



y -STEPHENS sat crouched on 
the single-piece bench that 
served as chair and table and bed 
for the psychotic ward. A cigarette 
dangled between his dark green 
lips. The cube-like room was ascetic, 
barren. The walls glittered dully. 
From time to time V-Stephens ex- 
amined his wristwatch and then 
turned his attention back to the 
object crawling up and down the 
sealed edges of the entrance-lock. 

The object moved slowly and 
cautiously. It had been exploring 
the lock for twenty-nine hours 
straight; it had traced down the 
power leads that kept the heavy 

25 




plate fused in place. It had located 
the terminals at which the leads 
joined the magnetic rind of the 
door. During the last hour it had 
cut its way through the rexeroid 
surface to within an inch of the 
terminals. The crawling, exploring 
object was V-Stephens’ surgeon- 
hand, a self-contained robot of pre- 
cision quality usually joined to his 
right wrist. 

It wasn’t joined there now. He 
had detached it and sent it up the 
face of the cube to find a way out. 
The metal fingers clung precari- 
ously to the smooth dull surface, as 
the cutting-thumb laboriously dug 
its way in. It was a big job for the 
surgeon-hand; after this it wouldn’t 
be of much use at the operating 
table. But V-Stephens could easily 
get another — they were for sale at 
any medical supply house on 
Venus. 

The forefinger of the surgeon- 
hand reached the anode terminal 
and paused questioningly. All four 
fingers rose erect and waved like 
insect antennae. One by one they 
fitted themselves into the cut slot 
and probed for the nearby cathode 
lead. 

Abruptly there was a blinding 
flash. A white acrid cloud billowed 
out, and then came a sharp pop. 
The entrance-lock remained mo- 
tionless as the hand dropped to the 
floor, its work done. V-Stephens 
put out his cigarette, got leisurely 
to his feet, and crossed the cube to 
collect it. 

With the hand in place and act- 
ing as part of his own neuromus- 
cular system again, V-Stephens 
^ngerly grasped the lock by its 
perimeter and after a moment 
pulled inward. The lock came with- 

26 



out resistance and he found him- 
self facing a deserted corridor. 
There was no sound or motion. No 
guards. No check-system on the 
psych patients. V-Stephens loped 
quickly ahead, around a turn, and 
through a series of connecting pas- 
sages. 

In a moment he was at a 
wide view-window, overlooking the 
street, the surrounding buildings, 
and the hospital grounds. 

He assembled his wristwatch, 
cigarette lighter, fountain pen, keys 
and coins. From them his agile 
flesh and metal fingers rapidly 
formed an intricate gestalt of wir- 
ing and plates. He snapped off the 
cutting-thumb and screwed a heat- 
element in its place. In a brief 
flurry he had fused the mechanism 
to the underside of the window 
ledge, invisible from the hall, too 
far from ground level to be no- 
ticed. 

He was starting back down the 
corridor when a sound stopped 
him rigid. Voices, a routine hos- 
pital guard and somebody else. A 
familiar somebody else. 

He raced back to the psych ward 
and into his sealed cube. The mag- 
netic lock fitted reluctantly in 
place; the heat generated by the 
short had sprung its clamps. He 
got it shut as footsteps halted out- 
side. The magnetic field of the lock 
was dead, but of course the visitor 
didn’t know that. V-Stephens lis- 
tened with amusement as the visi- 
tor carefully negated the supposed 
magnetic field and then pushed the 
lock open. 

“Come in,” V-Stephens said. 

Doctor LeMarr entered, brief- 
case in one hand, cold-beam in the 
other. “Come along with me. I 

PHILIP K. DICK 




have everything arranged. Money, 
fake identification, passport, tickets 
and clearance. You’ll go as a web- 
foot commercial agent. By the time 
Gannet finds out you’ll be past the 
Military monitor and out of Earth 
jurisdiction.” 

V-Stephens was astounded. 
“But—” 

“Hurry up!” LeMarr waved him 
into the corridor with his cold- 
beam. “As a staff member of the 
hospital I have authority over 
psych prisoners. Technically, you’re 
listed as a mental patient. As far as 
I’m concerned you’re no more 
crazy than the rest of them. If not 
less. That’s why I’m here.” 

V-Stephens eyed him doubtfully. 
“You sure you know what you’re 
doing?” He followed LeMarr 
down the corridor, past the blank- 
faced guard and into the elevator. 
“They’ll destroy you as a traitor, 
if they catch you. That guard saw 
you — ^how are you going to keep 
this quiet?” 

“I don’t expect to keep this 
quiet. Gannet is here, you know. 
He and his staff have been working 
over the old man.” 

“Why are you telling me this?” 
The two of them strode down the 
descent ramp to the subsurface ga- 
rage. An attendant rolled out Le- 
Marr’s car and they climbed into 
it, LeMarr behind the wheel. “You 
know why I was thrown in the 
psych-cube in the first place.” 

“Take this.” LeMarr tossed 
V-Stephens the cold-beam and 
steered up the tunnel to the sur- 
face, into the bright mid-day New 
York traffic. “You were going to 
contact Color- Ad and inform them 
Earth will absolutely lose the war.” 
He spun the car from the main- 

WAR VETERAN 



stream of traffic and onto a side 
lane, toward the interplan space- 
field. “Tell them to stop working 
for compromise and strike hard — 
immediately. Full scale war. 
Right?” 

“Right,” V-Stephens said. “After 
all, if we’re certain to win — ” 
“You’re not certain.” 

V-Stephens raised a green eye- 
brow. “Oh? I thought Unger was 
a veteran of total defeat.” 

“Gannet is going to change the 
course of the war. He’s found a 
critical point. As soon as he gets 
the exact information he’ll pres- 
sure the Directorate into an all-out 
attack on Venus and Mars. War 
can’t be avoided, not now.” Le- 
Marr slammed his car to a halt at 
the edge of the interplan field. “If 
there has to be war at least no- 
body’s going to be taken by a sneak 
attack. You can tell your Colonial 
Organization and Administration 
our warfleet is on its way. Tell them 
to get ready. Tell them — ” 

LeMarr’s voice trailed off. Like 
an unwound toy he sagged against 
the seat, slid silently down, and lay 
quietly with his head against the 
steering wheel. His glasses dropped 
from his nose onto the floor and 
after a moment V-Stephens re- 
placed them. “I’m sorry,” he said 
softly. “You meant well, but you 
sure fouled everything up.” 

He briefly examined the surface 
of LeMarr’s skull. The impulse 
from the cold-beam had not pene- 
trated into brain tissue; LeMarr 
would regain consciousness in a 
few hours with nothing worse than 
a severe headache. V-Stephens 
pocketed the cold-beam, grabbed 
up the briefcase, and pushed the 
limp body of LeMarr away from 

27 




the wheel. A moment later he was 
turning on the motor and backing 
the car around. 

As he sped back to the hospital 
he examined his watch. It wasn’t 
too late. He leaned forward and 
dropped a quarter in the pay vid- 
phone mounted on the dashboard. 
After a mechanical dialing process 
the Color-Ad receptionist flickered 
into view. 

“This is V-Stephens,” he said. 
“Something went wrong. I was 
taken out of the hospital building. 
I’m heading back there now. I can 
make it in time, I think.” 

“Is the vibrator-pack assem- 
bled?” 

“Assembled, yes. But not with 
me. I had already fused it into 
polarization with the magnetic flux. 
It’s ready to go — if I can get back 
there and at it.” 

“There’s a hitch at this end,” the 
green-skinned girl said. “Is this a 
closed circuit?” 

“It’s open,” V-Stephens admit- 
ted. “But it’s public and probably 
random. They couldn’t very well 
have a bug on it.” He checked the 
power meter on the guarantee seal 
fastened to the unit. “It shows no 
drain. Go ahead.” 

“The ship won’t be able to pick 
you up in the city.” 

“Hell,” V-Stephens said. 

“You’ll have to get out of New 
York on your own power; we can’t 
help you there. Mobs destroyed our 
New York port facilities. You’ll 
have to go by surface car to Den- 
ver. That’s the nearest place the 
ship can land. That’s our last pro- 
tected spot on Earth.” 

V-Stephens groaned. “Just my 
luck. You know what’ll happen if 
they catch me?” 

28 



The girl smiled faintly. “All web* 
foots look alike to Earthmen. 
They’ll be stringing us up indis- 
criminately. We’re in this together. 
Good luck; we’ll be waiting for 
you.” 

V-Stephens angrily broke the cir- 
cuit and slowed Ae car. He parked 
in a public lot on a dingy side 
street and got quickly out. He was 
at the edge of the green expanse 
of park. Beyond it, the hospital 
buildings rose. Gripping the brief- 
case tightly he ran toward the main 
entrance. 

AVID UNGER wiped his^ 
mouth on his sleeve, then lay 
back weakly against his chair. “I 
don’t know,” he repeated, his voice 
faint and dry. “I told you I don’t 
remember any more. It was so long 
ago.” 

Gannet signalled, and the officers 
moved away from the old man. 
“It’s coming,” he said wearily. He 
mopped his perspiring forehead. 
“Slowly and surely. We should 
have what we want inside another 
half hour.” 

One side of the therapy house 
had been turned into a Military 
table-map. Counters had been laid 
out across the surface to represent 
units of the webfoot and crow 
fleets. White luminous chips repre- 
sented Earth ships lined up against 
them in a tight ring around the 
third planet. 

“It’s someplace near here,” Lieu- 
tenant West said to Patterson. Red- 
eyed, stubble-chinned, hands shak- 
ing with fatigue and tension, he 
indicated a section of the map. 
“Unger remembers hearing offi- 
cers talking about this convoy. The 

PHILIP K. DICK 





convoy took oflF from a supply base 
on Ganymede. It disappeared on 
some kind of deliberate random 
course.” His hand swept the area. 
“At the time, nobody on Earth 
paid any attention to it. Later, they 
realized what they’d lost. Some 
military expert charted the thing 
in retrospect and it was taped and 
passed around. Officers got to- 
gether and analyzed the incident. 
Unger thinks the convoy route took 
it close to Europa. But maybe it 
was Callisto.” 

“That’s not good enough,” Gan- 
net snapped. “So far we don’t have 
any more route data than Earth 
tacticians had at the time. We need 
to add exact knowledge, material 
released after the event.” 

David Unger fumbled with a 
glass of water. “Thanks,” he mut- 
tered gratefully, as one of the young 
officers handed it to him. “I sure 
wish I could help you fellows out 
better,” he said plaintively. “I’m 
trying to remember. But I don’t 
seem able to think clear, like I used 
to.” 'His wizened face twisted with 
futile concentration. “You know, it 
seems to me that convoy was 
stopped near Mars by some kind 
of meteor swarm.” 

Gannet moved forward. “Go 
on. 

Unger appealed to him pathet- 
ically. “I want to help you all I 
can, mister. Most people go to write 
a book about a war, they just scan 
stuff from other books.” There was 
pitiful gratitude on the eroded face. 
“I guess you’ll mention my name in 
your book, someplace.” 

So that was it. Patterson turned 
away, sickened. Gannet was posing 
as a military historian. Writing a 
book on the lost war, gleaning 

WAR VETERAN 



memories from the old man for his 
“treatise”. 

“Sure,” Gannet said expansively. 
“Your name’ll be on the first page. 
Maybe we could even get in a pic- 
ture of you.” 

“I know all about the war,” 
Unger muttered. “Give me time 
and I’ll have it straight. Just give 
me time. I’m trying as best I can.” 
The old man was deteriorating 
rapidly. His wrinkled face was an 
unhealthy gray. Like drying putty, 
his flesh clung to his brittle, yel- 
lowed bones. His breath rattled in 
his throat. It was obvious to every- 
one present that David Unger was 
going to die — and soon. 

“If he croaks before he remem- 
bers,” Gannet said softly to Lieu- 
tenant West, “I’ll—” 

“What’s that?” Unger asked 
sharply. His one good eye was sud- 
denly keen and wary. “I can’t hear 
so good.” 

“Just fill in the missing ele- 
ments,” Gannet said wearily. He 
jerked his head. “Get him over to 
the map where he can see the set- 
up. Maybe that’ll help.” 

The old man was yanked to his 
feet and propelled to the table. 
Technicians and brass hats closed 
in around him and the dim-eyed 
stumbling figure was lost from 
sight. 

“He won’t last long,” Patterson 
said savagely. “If you don’t let him 
rest his heart’s going to give out.” 
“We must have the informa- 
tion,” Gannet retorted. He eyed 
Patterson. “Where’s the other doc- 
tor? LeMarr, I think he’s called.” 
Patterson glanced briefly around. 
“I don’t see him. He probably 
couldn’t stand it.” 

“LeMarr never came,” Gannet 

29 




said, without emotion. “I wonder 
if we should have somebody round 
him up.” He indicated Evelyn Cut- 
ter, who had just arrived, white- 
faced, her black eyes wide, breath- 
ing quickly. “She suggests — ” 

“It doesn’t matter now,” Evelyn 
said frigidly. She shot a quick, ur- 
gent glance at Patterson. “I want 
nothing to do with you and your 
war.” 

Gannet shrugged. “I’ll send out 
a routine net, in any case. Just to 
be on the safe side.” He moved off, 
leaving Evelyn and Patterson 
standing alone together. 

“Listen to me,” Evelyn said 
harshly, her lips hot and close to 
his ear. ^‘Unger^s number has come 
up:' 

They looked at each other. 
“When did they notify you?” 
Patterson demanded. 

“I was on my way here. I did 
what you said — I fixed it up with a 
clerk at Military.” 

“How long ago?” 

“Just now.” Evelyn’s face trem- 
bled. “Vachel, he’s here." 

It was a moment before Patter- 
son understood. “You mean they 
sent him over here? To the hos- 
pital?” 

“I told them to. I told them 
when he came to volunteer, when 
his number came to the top — ” 
Patterson grabbed her and hur- 
ried her from the therapy house, 
outside into the bright sunlight. He 
pushed her onto an ascent ramp 
and crowded in after her. “Where 
are they holding him?” 

“In the public reception room. 
They told him it was a routine 
physical check. A minor test of 
some kind.” Evelyn was terrified. 
“What are we going to do? Can 

30 



we do something?” 

“Gannet thinks so.” 

“Suppose we — stopped him? 

Maybe we could turn him aside.” 
She shook her head, dazed. “What 
would happen? What would the 
future be like if we stopped him 
here? You could keep him out of 
the Service — you’re a doctor. A 
little red check on his health card.” 
She began to laugh wildly. “I see 
them all the time. A little red 
check, and no more David Unger. 
Gannet never sees him, Gannet 
never knows Earth can’t win and 
then Earth will win, and V- 
Stephens doesn’t get locked up as 
a psychotic and that webfoot 
girl—” 

Patterson’s open hand smashed 
across the woman’s face. “Shut up 
and snap out of it! We don’t have 
time for that!” 

Evelyn shuddered ; he caught 
hold of her and held on tight to 
her until finally she raised her face. 
A red welt was rising slowly on her 
cheek. “I’m sorry,” she managed 
to murmur. “Thanks. I’ll be all 
right.” 

The lift had reached the main 
floor. The door slid back and Pat- 
terson led her out into the hall. 
“You haven’t seen him?” 

“No. When they told me the 
number had come up and he was 
on his way,” Evelyn hurried breath- 
lessly after Patterson, “I came as 
quickly as I could. Maybe it’s too 
late. Maybe he got tired of waiting 
and left. He’s a fifteen year old boy. 
He wants to get into the fight. 
Maybe he’s gone!” 

Patterson halted a robot attend- 
ant. “Are you busy?” 

“No sir,” the robot answered. 
Patterson gave the robot David 

PHILIP K. DICK 




Unger’s i.d. number. “Get this 
man from the main reception 
room. Send him out here and then 
close off this hall. Seal it at both 
ends so nobody can enter or leave.” 
The robot clicked uncertainly. 
“Will there be further orders? This 
syndrome doesn’t complete a — ” 
“I’ll instruct you later. Make 
sure nobody comes out with him. 
I want to meet him here alone.” 
The robot scanned the number 
and then disappeared into the re- 
ception room. 

Patterson gripped Evelyn’s arm. 
“Scared?” 

“I’m terrified.” 

“I’ll handle it. You just stand 
there.” He passed her his cigarettes. 
“Light one for both of us.” 

“Three, maybe. One for Unger.” 
Patterson grinned. “He’s too 
young, remember? He’s not old 
enough to smoke.” 

The robot returned. With it was 
a blond boy, plump and blue-eyed, 
his face wrinkled with perplexity. 
“You wanted me, Doc?” He came 
uncertainly up to Patterson. “Is 
there something wrong with me? 
They told me to come here, but 
they didn’t say what for.” His 
anxiety increased with a tidal rush. 
“There’s nothing to keep me out 
of the Service, is there?” 

Patterson grabbed the boy’s new- 
ly stamped i.d. card, glanced at it, 
and then passed it to Evelyn. She 
accepted it with paralyzed fingers, 
her eyes on the blond youth. 

He was not David Unger. 

HAT’S your name?” Patter- 
son demanded. 

The boy stammered out his name 
shyly. “Bert Robinson. Doesn’t it 

WAR VETERAN 



say there on my card?” 

Patterson turned to Evelyn. “It’s 
the right number. But this isn’t 
Unger. Something’s happened.” 
“Say, Doc,” Robinson asked 
plaintively, “is there something go- 
ing to keep me out of the Service 
or not? Give me the word.” 

Patterson signalled the robot. 
“Open up the hall. It’s all over 
with. You can go back to what you 
were doing.” 

“I don’t understand,” Evelyn 
murmured. “It doesn’t make 
sense.” 

“You’re all right,” Patterson said 
to the youth. “You can report for 
induction.” 

The boy’s face sagged with relief. 
“Thanks a lot. Doc.” He edged to- 
ward the descent ramp. “I sure ap- 
preciate it. I’m dying to get a crack 
at those webfoots.” 

“Now what?” Evelyn said tight- 
ly, when the youth’s broad back 
had disappeared. “Where do we go 
from here?” 

Patterson shook himself alive. 
“We’ll get the Census Department 
to make their check. We've got to 
locate Unger," 

The transmission room was a 
humming blur of vid and aud re- 
ports. Patterson elbowed his way 
to an open circuit and placed the 
call. 

“That information will take a 
short time, sir,” the girl at Census 
told him. “Will you wait, or shall 
we return your call?” 

Patterson grabbed up an h-loop 
and clipped it around his neck. 
“As soon as you have any informa- 
tion on Unger let me know. Break 
into this loop immediately.” 

“Yes sir,” the girl said dutifully, 
and broke the circuit. 




31 




Patterson headed out of the 
room and down the corridor. Evelyn 
hurried after him. “Where are we 
going?” she asked. 

“To the therapy house. I want to 
talk to the old man. I want to ask 
him some things.” 

“Gannet’s doing that,” Evelyn 
gasped, as they descended to 
ground level. “Why do you — ” 

“I want to ask him about the 
present, not the future.” They 
emerged in the blinding afternoon 
sunlight. “I want to ask him about 
things going on right now.” 

Evelyn stopped him. “Can’t you 
explain it to me?” 

“I have a theory.” Patterson 
pushed urgently past her. “Come 
on, before it’s too late.” 

They entered the therapy house. 
Technicians and officers were 
standing around the huge map 
table, examining the counters and 
indicator lines. “Where’s Unger?” 
Patterson demanded. 

“He’s gone,” one of the officers 
answered. “Gannet gave up for to- 
day.” 

“Gone where?” Patterson began 
to swear savagely. “What hap- 
pened?” 

“Gannet and West took him 
back to the main building. He was 
too worn out to continue. We al- 
most had it. Gannet’s ready to 
burst a blood vessel, but we’ll have 
to wait.” 

Patterson grabbed Evelyn Cut- 
ter. “I want you to set off a general 
emergency alarm. Have the build- 
ings surrounded. And hurry/* 
Evelyn gaped at him. “But — 
Patterson ignored her and raced 
out of the therapy house, toward 
the main hospital building. Ahead 
of him were three slowly-moving 

32 



figures. Lieutenant West and Gan- 
net walked on each side of the old 
man, supporting him as he crept 
feebly forward. 

“Get away!” Patterson shouted 
at them. 

Gannet turned. “What’s going 
on?” 

“Get him away!” Patterson 
dived for the old man — ^but it was 
too late. 

The burst of energy seared past 
him; an ignited circle of blinding 
white flame lapped everywhere. 
The hunched-over figure of the old 
man wavered, then charred. The 
aluminum cane fused and ran 
down in a molten mass. What had 
been the old man began to smoke. 
The body cracked open and shriv- 
eled. Then very slowly the dried, 
dehydrated fragment of ash crum- 
pled in a weightless heap. Grad- 
ually the circle of energy faded out. 



G annet kicked aimlessly at it, 
his heavy face numb with 
shock and disbelief. “He’s dead. 
And we didn’t get it.” 

Lieutenant West stared at the 
still-smoking ash. His lips twisted 
into words. “We’ll never find out. 
We can’t change it. We can’t win.” 
Suddenly his fingers grabbed at his 
coat. He tore the insignia from it 
and hurled the square of cloth sav- 
agely away. “I’ll be damned if I’m 
going to give up my life so you can 
corner the system. I’m not getting 
into that death trap. Count me 
out!” 

The wail of the general emer- 
gency alarm dinned from the hos- 
pital building. Scampering figures 
raced toward Gannet, soldiers and 
hospital guards scurrying in con- 

PHILIP K. DICK 




fusion. Patterson paid no attention 
to them; his eyes were on the win- 
dow directly above. 

Someone was standing there. A 
man, his hands deftly at work re- 
moving an object that flashed in 
the afternoon sun. The man was 
V-Stephens. He got the object of 
metal and plastic loose and dis- 
appeared with it, away from the 
window. 

Evelyn hurried up beside Pat- 
terson. “What — ” She saw the re- 
mains and screamed. “Oh, God. 
Who did it? Who?^^ 

“V-Stephens.” 

“LeMarr must have let him out. 
I knew it would happen.” Tears 
filled her eyes and her voice rose 
in shrill hysteria. “I told you he’d 
do it! I warned you!” 

Gannet appealed childishly to 
Patterson. “What are we going to 
do? He’s been murdered.” Rage 
suddenly swept away the big man’s 
fear. “I’ll kill every webfoot on the 
planet. I’ll burn down their homes 
and string them up. I’ll — He 
broke off raggedly. “But it’s too 
late, isn’t it? There’s nothing we 
can do. We’ve lost. We’re beaten, 
and the war hasn’t even begun.” 

“That’s right,” Patterson said. 
“It’s too late. Your chance is gone.” 

“If we could have got him to 
talk — ” Gannet snarled helplessly. 

“You couldn’t. It wasn’t possi- 
ble.” 

Gannet blinked. “Why not?” 
Some of his innate animal cunning 
filtered back. “Why do you say 
that?” 

Around Patterson’s neck his h- 
loop buzzed loudly. “Doctor Pat- 
terson,” the monitor’s voice came, 
“there is a rush call for you from 
Census.” 



“Put it through,” Patterson said. 
The voice of the Census clerk 
came tinnily in his ears. “Doctor 
Patterson, I have the information 
you requested.” 

“What is it?” Patterson de- 
manded. But he already knew the 
answer. 

“We have cross-checked our re- 
sults to be certain. There is no per- 
son such as you described. There is 
no individual at this time or in our 
past records named David L. 
Unger with the identifying charac- 
teristics you outlined. The brain, 
teeth, and fingerprints do not re- 
fer to anything extant in our files. 
Do you wish us to — ” 

“No,” Patterson said. “That an- 
swers my question. Let it go.” He 
cut off the h-loop switch. 

Gannet was listening dully. 
“This is completely over my head, 
Patterson. Explain it to me.” 
Patterson ignored him. He 
squatted down and poked at the 
ash that had been David Unger. 
After a moment he snapped the 
h-loop on again. “I want this taken 
upstairs to the analytical labs,” he 
ordered quietly. “Get a team out 
here at once.” He got slowly to his 
feet and added even more softly, 
“Then I’m going to find V- 
Stephens — if I can.” 

“He’s undoubtedly on his way to 
Venus by now,” Evelyn Cutter said 
bitterly. “Well, that’s that. There’s 
nothing we can do about it.” 

“We’re going to have war,” Gan- 
net admitted. He came slowly back 
to reality. With a violent effort he 
focussed on the people around 
him. He smoothed down his mane 
of white hair and adjusted his coat. 
A semblance of dignity was re- 
stored to his once-impressive frame. 

33

“We might as well meet it like 
men. There’s no use trying to es- 
cape it.” 

Patterson moved aside as a group 
of hospital robots approached the 
charred remains and began ginger- 
ly to collect them in a single heap. 
“Make a complete analysis,” he 
said to the technician in charge of 
the work-detail. “Break down the 
basic cell-units, especially the neu- 
rological apparatus. Report what 
you find to me as soon as you pos- 
sibly can.” 

It took just about an hour. 

“Look for yourself,” the lab tech- 
nician said. “Here, take hold of 
some of the material. It doesn’t 
even feel right.” 

Patterson accepted a sample of 
dry, brittle organic matter. It might 
have been the smoked skin of some 
sea creature. It broke apart easily 
in his hands; as he put it down 
among the test equipment it crum- 
bled into powdery fragments. “I 
see,” he said slowly. 

“It’s good, considering. But it’s 
weak. Probably it wouldn’t have 
stood up another couple of days. It 
was deteriorating rapidly; sun, air, 
everything was breaking it down. 
There was no innate repair-system 
involved. Our cells are constantly 
reprocessed, cleaned and main- 
tained. This thing was set up and 
then pushed into motion. Obvious- 
ly, somebody’s a long way ahead of 
us in biosynthetics. This is a mas- 
terpiece.” 

“Yes, it’s a good job,” Patterson 
admitted. He took another sample 
of what had been the body of 
David Unger and thoughtfully 
broke it into small dry pieces. “It 
fooled us completely.” 

34 



“You knew, didn’t you?” 

“Not at first.” 

“As you can see we’re recon- 
structing the whole system, getting 
the ash back into one piece. Parts 
are missing, of course, but we can 
get the general outlines. I’d like to 
meet the manufacturers of this 
thing. This really worked. This was 
no machine.” 

Patterson located the charred 
ash that had been reconstructed 
into the android’s face. Withered, 
blackened paper-thin flesh. The 
dead eye gazed out lusterless and 
blind. Census had been right. There 
was never a David Unger. Such a 
person had never lived on Earth or 
anywhere else. What they had 
called “David Unger” was a man- 
made synthetic. 

“We were really taken in,” Pat- 
terson admitted. “How many peo- 
ple know, beside the two of us?” 
“Nobody else.” The lab tech- 
nician indicated his squad of work- 
robots. “I’m the only human on 
this detail.” 

“Can you keep it quiet?” 

“Sure. You’re my boss, you 
know.” 

“Thanks,” Patterson said. “But 
if you want, this information would 
get you another boss any time.” 
“Gannet?” The lab technician 
laughed. “I don’t think I’d like to 
work for him.” 

“He’d pay you pretty well.” 
“True,” said the lab technician. 
“But one of these days I’d be in the 
front lines. I like it better here in 
the hospital.” 

Patterson started toward the 
door. “If anybody asks, tell them 
there wasn’t enough left to analyze. 
Can you dispose of these remains?” 
“I’d hate to, but I guess I can.” 

PHILIP K. DICK 




The technician eyed him curious- 
ly. “You have any idea who put 
this thing together? I’d hke to 
shake hands with them.” 

“I’m interested in only one thing 
right now,” Patterson said oblique- 
ly. “V-Stephens has to be found.” 



L EMARR blinked, as dull late- 
afternoon sunlight filtered into 
his brain. He pulled himself up- 
right — and banged his head sharp- 
ly on the dashboard of the car. Pain 
swirled around him and for a time 
he sank back down into agonized 
darkness. Then slowly, gradually, 
he emerged. And peered around 
him. 

His car was parked in the rear 
of a small, dilapidated public lot. 
It was about five-thirty. Traffic 
swarmed noisily along the narrow 
street onto which the lot fed. Le- 
Marr reached up and gingerly ex- 
plored the side of his skull. There 
was a numb spot the size of a sil- 
ver dollar, an area totally without 
sensation. The spot radiated a chill 
breath, the utter absence of heat, 
as if somehow he had bumped 
against a nexus of outer space. 

He was still trying to collect him- 
self and recollect the events that 
had preceded his period of uncon- 
sciousness, when the swift-moving 
form of Doctor V-Stephens ap- 
peared. 

V-Stephens ran lithely between 
the parked surface cars, one hand 
in his coat pocket, eyes alert and 
wary. There was something strange 
about him, a difference that Le- 
Marr in his befuddled state 
couldn’t pin down. V-Stephens 
had almost reached the car before 
he realized what it was — and at the 

WAR VETERAN 



same time was lashed by the full 
surge of memory. He sank down 
and lay against the door, as limp 
and inert as possible. In spite of 
himself he started slightly, as V- 
Stephens yanked the door open and 
slid behind the wheel. 

V-Stephens was no longer green. 

The Venusian slammed the door, 
jabbed the car key in the lock, and 
started up the motor. He lit a cig- 
arette, examined his pair of heavy 
gloves, glanced briefly at LeMarr, 
and pulled out of the lot into the 
early-evening traffic. For a mo- 
ment he drove with one gloved 
hand on the wheel, the other still 
inside his coat. Then, as he gained 
full speed, he slid his cold-beam 
out, gripped it briefly, and dropped 
it on the seat beside him. 

LeMarr pounced on it. From 
the comer of his eye, V-Stephens 
saw the limp body swing into life. 
He slammed on the emergency 
brake and forgot the wheel; the two 
of them struggled silently, furiously. 
The car shrieked to a halt and 
immediately became the center of 
an angry mass of honking car-horns. 
The two men fought with desperate 
intensity, neither of them breath- 
ing, locked almost immobile as 
momentarily all forces balanced. 
Then LeMarr yanked away, the 
cold-beam aimed at V-Stephens’ 
colorless face. 

“What happened?” he croaked 
hoarsely. “I’m missing five hours. 
What did you do?^^ 

V-Stephens said nothing. He re- 
leased the brake and began driv- 
ing slowly with the swirl of traffic. 
Gray cigarette smoke dribbled from 
between his lips; his eyes were half- 
closed, filmed over and opaque. 

“You’re an Earthman,” LeMarr 

35 




said, wonderingly. “You’re not a 
webfoot after all.” 

“Fm a Venusian,” V-Stephens 
answered indifTerently. He showed 
his webbed fingers, then replaced 
his heavy driving gloves. 

“But how — ” 

“You think we can’t pass over 
the color line when we want to?” 
V-Stephens shrugged. “Dyes, chem- 
ical hormones, a few minor surgical 
operations. A half hour in the 
men’s room with a hypodermic and 
salve. This is no planet for a 
man with green skin.” 

Across the street a hasty barri- 
cade had been erected. A group 
of sullen-faced men stood around 
with guns and crude hand-clubs, 
some of them wearing gray Home 
Guard caps. They were flagging 
down cars one by one and search- 
ing them. A beefy-faced man waved 
V-Stephens to a halt. He strolled 
over and gestured for the window 
to be rolled down. 

“What’s going on?” LeMarr de- 
manded nervously. 

“Looking for webfoots,” the man 
growled, a thick odor of garlic and 
perspiration steaming from his 
heavy canvas shirt. He darted 
quick, suspicious glances into the 
car. “Seen any around?” 

“No,” V-Stephens said. 

The man ripped open the lug- 
gage compartment and peered in. 
“We caught one a couple minutes 
ago.” He jerked his thick thumb. 
“See him up there?” 

The Venusian had been strung 
up to a street lamp. His green body 
dangled and swayed with the early- 
evening wind. His face was a 
mottled, ugly mask of pain. A 
crowd of people stood around the 
pole, grim, mean-looking. Waiting. 

36 



“There’ll be more,” the man 
said, as he slammed the luggage 
compartment. “Plenty more.” 
“What happened?” LeMarr 
managed to ask. He was nauseated 
and horrified; his voice came out 
almost inaudible. “Why all this?” 
“A webfoot killed a man. An 
£ar^/iman.” The man pulled back 
and slapped the car. “Okay — you 
can go.” 

V-Stephens moved the car for- 
ward. Some of the loitering people 
had whole uniforms, combinations 
of the Home Guard gray and 
Terran blue. Boots, heavy belt- 
buckles, caps, pistols, and arm- 
bands. The armbands read D.C. 
in bold black letters against a red 
background. 

“What’s that?” LeMarr asked 
faintly. 

“Defense Committee,” V-Ste- 
phens answered. “Gannet’s front 
outfit. To defend Earth against the 
webfoots and crows.” 

“But — ” LeMarr gestured help- 
lessly. “Is Earth being attacked?” 
“Not that I know of.” 

“Turn the car around. Head 
back to the hospital.” 

V-Stephens hesitated, then did 
as he was told. In a moment the 
car was speeding back toward the 
center of New York. “What’s this 
for?” V-Stephens asked. “Why do 
you want to go back?” ^ 

LeMarr didn’t hear him; he was 
gazing with fixed horror at the 
people along the street. Men and 
women prowling like animals, look- 
ing for something to kill. “They’ve 
gone crazy,” LeMarr muttered. 
“They’re beasts.” 

“No,” V-Stephens said. “This’ll 
die down, soon. When the Com- 
mittee gets its financial support 

PHILIP K. DICK 




Jerked out from under it. It’s still 
going full blast, but pretty soon the 
gears will change around and the 
big engine will start grinding in re- 
verse. 

“Why?” 

“Because Gannet doesn’t want 
‘war, now. It takes awhile for the 
new line to trickle down. Gannet 
will probably finance a movement 
called P.G. Peace Committee.” 

The hospital was surrounded by 
a wall of tanks and trucks and 
heavy mobile guns. V-Stephens 
slowed the car to a halt and stubbed 
out his cigarette. No cars were be- 
ing passed. Soldiers moved among 
the tanks with gleaming heavy-duty 
weapons that were still shiny with 
packing grease. 

“Well?” V-Stephens said. “What 
now? You have the gun. It’s your 
hot potato.” 

LeMarr dropped a coin in the 
vidphone mounted on the dash- 
board. He gave the hospital num- 
ber, and when the monitor ap- 
peared, asked hoarsely for Vachel 
Patterson. 

“Where are you?” Patterson de- 
manded. He saw the cold-beam in 
LeMarr’s hand, and then his eyes 
fastened on V-Stephens. “I see 
you got him.” 

“Yes,” LeMarr agreed, “but I 
don’t understand what’s happen- 
ing.” He appealed helplessly to 
Patterson’s miniature vidimage. 
“What’U I do? What is all this?” 

“Give me your location,” Pat- 
terson said tensely. 

LeMarr did so. “You want me 
to bring him to the hospital? May- 
be I should — ” 

“Just hold onto that cold-beam. 
I’ll be right there.” Patterson broke 
the connection and the scjreen died. 



LeMarr shook his head in be- 
wilderment. “I was trying to get 
you away,” he said to V-Stephens. 
“Then you cold-beamed me. Why? 
Suddenly LeMarr shuddered vio- 
lently. Full understanding came to 
him. “You killed David Unger!” 
“That’s right,” V-Stephens an- 
swered. 

The cold-beam trembled in Le- 
Marr’s hand. “Maybe I ought to 
kill you right now. Maybe I ought 
to roll down the window and yell 
to those madmen to come and get 
you. I don’t know.” 

“Do whatever you think best,” 
V-Stephens said. 

LeMarr was still trying to de- 
cide, when Patterson appeared be- 
side the car. He rapped on the 
window and LeMarr unlocked the 
door. Patterson climbed quickly in 
and slammed the door after him. 

“Start up the car,” he said to 
V-Stephens. “Keep moving, away 
from downtown.” 

V-Stephens glanced briefly at 
him, and then slowly started up the 
motor. “You might as well do it 
here,” he said to Patterson. “No- 
body’ll interfere.” 

“I want to get out of the city,” 
Patterson answered. He added in 
explanation, “My lab staff analyzed 
the remains of David Unger. They 
were able to reconstruct most of 
the synthetic.” 

V-Stephens’ face registered a 
surge of frantic emotion. “Oh?” 
Patterson reached out his hand. 
“Shake,” he said grimly. 

“Why?” V-Stephens asked, puz- 
zled. 

“Somebody told me to do this. 
Somebody who agrees you Venus- 
ians did one hell of a good job 
when you made that android.”

T he car purred along the 
highway, through the evening 
gloom. “Denver is the last place 
left,” V-Stephens explained to the 
two Earthmen. “There’re too many 
of us, there. Color-Ad says a few 
Committee men started shelling our 
offices, but the Directorate put a 
sudden stop to it. Gannet’s pres- 
sure, probably.” 

“I want to hear more,” Patter- 
son said. “Not about Gannet; I 
know where he stands. I want to 
know what you people are up to.” 
“Color-Ad engineered the syn- 
thetic,” V-Stephens admitted. “We 
don’t know any more about the 
future than you do — ^which is ab- 
solutely nothing. There never was 
a David Unger. We forged the 
i.d. papers, built up a whole false 
personality, history of a nonex- 
istent war — everything.” 

“Why?” LeMarr demanded. 

“To scare Gannet into calling off 
the dogs. To terrify him into let- 
ting Venus and Mars become inde- 
pendent. To keep him from fan- 
ning up a war to preserve his eco- 
nomic strangle-hold. The fake his- 
tory we constructed in Unger’s 
mind has Gannet’s nine-world em- 
pire broken and destroyed. Gan- 
net’s a realist. He’d take a risk 
when he had odds — but our history 
put the odds one hundred percent 
against him.” 

“So Gannet pulls out,” Patterson 
said slowly. “And you?” 

“We were always out,” V-Ste- 
phens said quietly. “We were never 
in this war game. All we want is 
our freedom and independence. I 
don’t know what the war would 
really be like, but I can guess. Not 
very pleasant. Not worth it for 
either of us. And as things were go- 

38 



ing, war was in the cards.” 

“I want to get a few things 
straight,” Patterson said. “You’re 
a Color-Ad agent?” 

“Right.” 

“And V-Rafia?” 

“She was also Color-Ad. Ac- 
tually, all Venusians and Martians 
are Color-Ad agents as soon as they 
hit Earth. We wanted to get V- 
Rafia into the hospital to help me 
out. There was a chance I’d be 

prevented from destroying the 

synthetic at the proper time. If I 
hadn’t been able to do it, V-Rafia 
would have. But Gannet killed 
her.” 

“Why didn’t you simply cold- 
beam Unger?” 

“For one thing we wanted the 
synthetic body completely de- 

stroyed. That isn’t possible, of 
course. Reduced to ash was the 
next best thing. Broken down 

small enough so a cursory examina- 
tion wouldn’t show anything.” He 
glanced up at Patterson. “Why’d 
you order such a radical examina- 
tion?” 

“Unger’s i.d. number had come 
up. And Unger didn’t appear to 
claim it.” 

“Oh,” V-Stephens said uneasily. 
“That’s bad. We had no why to tell 
when it would appear. We tried to 
pick a number due in a few 
months — ^but enlistments rose 
sharply the last couple of weeks.” 
“Suppose you hadn’t been able 
to destroy Unger?” 

“We had the demolition machin- 
ery phased in such a way that the 
synthetic didn’t have a chance. It 
was tuned to his body; all I had to 
do was activate it with Unger in 
the general area. If I had been 
killed, or I hadn’t been able to set 

PHILIP K. DICK 




off the mechanism, the synthetic 
would have died naturally before 
Gannet got the information he 
wanted. Preferably, I was to de- 
stroy it in plain view of Gannet and 
his staff. It was important they 
think we knew about the war. The 
psychological shock-value of see- 
ing Unger murdered outweighs the 
risk of my capture.” 

“What happens next?” Patter- 
son asked presently. 

“Pm supposed to join with 
Color-Ad. Originally, I was to grab 
a ship at the New York office, but 
Gannet’ s mobs took care of that. 
Of course, this is assuming you 
won’t stop me.” 

LeMarr had begun to sweat. 
“Suppose Gannet finds out he was 
tricked? If he discovers there never 
was a David Unger — ” 

“We’re patching that up,” V- 
Stephens said. “By the time Gan- 
net checks, there will be a 
David Unger. Meanwhile — ” He 
shrugged. “It’s up to you two. 
You’ve got the gun.” 

“Let him go,” LeMarr said fer- 
vently. 

“That’s not very patriotic,” Pat- 
terson pointed out. “We’re helping 
the webfoots put over something. 
Maybe we ought to call in one of 
those Committee men.” 



“The devil with them,” LeMarr 
grated. “I wouldn’t turn anybody 
over to those lynch-happy lunatics. 
Even a — ” 

“Even a webfoot?” V-Stephens 
asked. 

Patterson was gazing up at the 
black, star-pocked sky. “What’s 
finally going to happen?” he asked 
V-Stephens. “You think this stuff 
will end?” 

“Sure,” V-Stephens said prompt- 
ly. “One of these days we’ll be 
moving out into the stars. Into 
other systems. We’ll bump into 
other races — and I mean real other 
races. Non-humans in the true sense 
of the word. Then people will see 
we’re all off the same stem. It’ll be 
obvious, when we’ve got something 
to compare ourselves to.” 

“Okay,” Patterson said. He took 
the cold-beam and handed it to 
V-Stephens. “That was all that 
worried me. I’d hate to think this 
stuff might keep on going.” 

“It’s won’t,” V-Stephens an- 
swered quietly. “Some of those non- 
human races ought to be pretty 
hideous. After a look at them, 
Earthmen will be glad to have their 
daughters marry men with green 
skin.” He grinned briefly. “Some 
of the non-human races may not 
have any skin at all. • • •

back in position to hide it. He below the horizon now, but the

sky was still a blaze of blue-white, 
with sunset clouds laced with 
flame. Tony Thunderton’s house 
was ahead of him, a bubble in the 
pinelike trees, and its plastic was 
clear. He searched the house with 
his eyes, but Tony wasn’t there. He 
hurried on, anxious to get past the 
house. 

“Hello, Bob,” Tony said. 

Bob Wistert stopped short. Tony 
was sitting in the yard, reading. 
He put aside his scanner and stood 
up. He was not a tall man and he 
was getting stout. His skin was 
bronze in the slowly fading light 
and his hair was black. He did not 
smile. 

“Find what you were after?” 
Tony asked. 

“Yes. Sure. Needed a battery.” 

“Good for you.” 

“Got to get back to Helen,” Bob 
said. “Time to eat.” 

“Give her my regards.” 

He walked on, trying not to 
hurry. He could feel Tony’s dark 
eyes following him down the path. 
When the trees screened him, he 
broke into a run. He entered his 
own house by the station wall and 
locked the door behind him. 

“Helen! Where are you?” 

She came out of the bedroom, 
straightening a clip in her brown 
hair. “What’s wrong?” Her voice 
was taut, as though wound too 
tightly on a spring. “You look like 
Hamlet’s old man filled you full of 
ectoplasm.” 

He took her hands, his tall, thin 
frame towering over his wife. 
“Honey, I’ve got some bad news.” 

“I can believe it. Are we in for a 
native uprising? Am I going to be 
burned at the stake like Jeanne 
d’Arc?”

“Dammit, Fm not kidding.” 

“Spill it, then. The suspense is 
killing me.” 

“Over in the storehouse,” Bob 
said quickly. “I was looking for a 
battery. I pushed a crate out of the 
way and found a trapdoor. There’s 
a cellar under there. It’s full of 
steel axes.” 

Helen’s face paled under her 
tan. She sat down. 

“What are we going to do?” she 
whispered. 

“You tell me,” Bob said. 

Together, moved by a common 
impulse, they turned and looked at 
the door. 

Toward Anthony Thunderton’s. 

“He must be insane,” Helen said. 

Outside, the wind was gentle in 
the trees and an alien sun was lost 
beneath an old and lovely sea. 

A lmost imperceptibly, the 
twilight deepened. Night would 
not fall for ten Earth-days. When 
it did come, it would last for a 
long, long time. 

There was no hurry. 

“I knew there was something 
fishy about this place,” Bob said. 
“I knew it the minute I got off that 
ship, the minute I spotted Thun- 
derton.” 

“We’ve only been here a month. 
Maybe we ought to give Tony the 
benefit of the doubt.” 

“Look,” he said. “When you see 
some joker coming at you with a 
lead pipe in his hand and blood in 
his eye, the only doubt you’re en- 
titled to is whether you can bash 
him before he bashes you.” He 
hesitated and then spoke slowly. 
“It’ll be over nineteen Earth-years 
before that ship comes back for us, 

42 



Helen. We’re the only people from 
Earth on this planet except for 
Tony — and Tony’s been here for 
ten years. He’s been alone here for 
five years, ever since his wife died. 
He’s been a god — he’s had absolute 
power if he wanted it. If he’s 
flipped his wig out here, we’ve got 
to know about it — and fast.” 

Helen looked away. She looked 
at their home, at the soft blue 
chairs and the pictures on the walls 
and the lazy couch before the fire- 
place. Something died in her eyes. 
“We can’t be sure he’s using those 
axes,” she said. 

“He’s using them all right, and 
he’s not using them to shave him- 
self with, either.” 

There was a long silence, broken 
only by the wind and the beat of 
the sea. 

“I’ll just have to go out and get 
some proof,” Bob said finally. 
“We’ll need photographs.” 

“He took you out to meet one 
group, didn’t he? You didn’t tell 
me about anything wrong there.” 
“I didn’t see anything,” Bob 
Wistert admitted. “That figures, 
though. He wouldn’t show me the 
ones he’d been working on, not 
unless he’s cracked more than I 
think he has. There’s another band 
of them about twenty miles east of 
here according to the contact map. 
I can get to them before night. 
We’ve got to know.” 

“Take me with you, Bob. I don’t 
want to stay here alone.” 

He kissed her lightly, ruffling her 
fragile brown hair with his hand. 
“No, lady. I can make better time 
alone, and you’ll be all right here. 
Just keep the door locked and keep 
a gun handy. Don’t let him in, 
Helen, no matter what happens.” 

CHAD OLIVER 




She didn’t argue. ‘‘You’ll need 
some food,” she said. 

Packing was simple enough. He 
put his bed roll in his pocket and 
slipped the force field generator on 
his wrist. The food pills went into 
his belt slots. He pulled on his 
boots and was ready to go. Weap- 
ons were not permitted off the sta- 
tion, and it did not occur to him 
that he could smuggle one out in 
his pocket if he wanted to. 

In any event, he wasn’t worried 
about the natives. 

“Don’t worry, baby. Everything 
will be all right.” 

“Of course,” she said. 

He went out into the bright blue 
twilight, light-years from the planet 
Earth. When he had gone, Helen 
locked the door behind him and 
sat down in one of the blue chairs. 

She began the wait that has 
never been measured. 

She looked toward Anthony 
Thunderton’s. “Damn you,” she 
said in a flat, cold voice. “Damn 
you for killing the only thing we 
ever had. Damn your soul.” 



I T TOOK Bob Wistert five Earth- 
days to find the natives. 

Through the tall green trees 
ahead of him, he saw a curl of blue 
woodsmoke in a grassy plain. He 
walked faster, his force field pro- 
tecting him from the thorny brush 
that guarded the cool forest floor. 
Once, not long ago, the scene be- 
fore him would have thrilled him 
with excitement. 

Now, there was only a nameless 
dread. 

The wind was in his face and he 
saw them before they saw him. 
They were few — ^perhaps thirty 

NIGHT 



men, women, and children squat- 
ting around low orange fires. Their 
crude lean-tos with thatched grass 
tops were almost invisible against 
a soft backdrop of swaying grasses 
and incredible weeds and flowers. 

The children were naked. The 
adults, however, were too sophisti- 
cated for nakedness. Their skin 
loin cloths were simple and un- 
adorned, but both men and women 
were scarified and wore wooden 
ear plugs the size of half-dollars 
within their stretched ear lobes. 
Their teeth were filed and dark- 
ened. They were a small people, 
and their skins were faintly green- 
ish. 

All in all, they looked quite hu- 
man. 

Stones had been heated in the fire 
until they were good and hot, and 
had then been dumped into bark 
containers full of water. The water 
boiled and cooked a varied assort- 
ment of plants, insects, and meat. 
There was no pottery. The only 
visible weapons were stone-tipped 
spears and curved throwing sticks. 

Bob Wistert made no attempt to 
hide himself. He walked straight 
toward the camp, his arms swing- 
ing easily at his sides. When the 
natives spotted him, they melted 
into the grass as though they had 
never been. 

He stood by the bubbling bark 
basket and waited. These people 
knew Thunderton; they would 
soon recognize that he was of the 
same tribe. 

Shortly, a young man stepped 
out of the grass, clapping his hard 
hands in greeting. A youn^ man! 
Bob, even after only a month, knew 
how wrong that was. 

He clapped his hands in return. 

43 




“I come in peace,” he said, speak- 
ing the language he had learned 
before coming to the seventh world 
of Sirius. “I am called Robert. I 
am the brother of Anthony, who is 
your brother.” 

“My brother, you are welcome 
here with the Nwarkon, the people. 
I am called Entun.” His voice was 
clear and liquid. Bob had no diffi- 
culty understanding him, although 
the dialect was different from what 
he had heard before. 

The others came out of the grass 
and shyly resumed their cooking. 
He noticed that the old men — there 
were four of them — seemed hesi- 
tant and confused. He kept his eye 
peeled, and he soon saw what he 
had come to see. 

Steel axes. 

Six of them. 

Five of them were in the posses- 
sion of young men. One was being 
used by a woman to knock clumsy 
branches from firewood. Bob kept 
talking politely, but he got all the 
pictures he needed with his ring 
camera. 

“It is ready,” Entun said. “Eat 
with us.” 

He could not refuse. He sat with 
the young man and ate some of the 
stew from a bark bowl. It was just 
as bad as it looked. When he had 
eaten, he stayed a decent interval 
with the Nwarkton, making the 
small talk that is the same every- 
where. He told lewd stories, but 
only to the proper relatives. He 
could not tell which of the girls 
might be his ‘sisters’, so he carefully 
avoided speaking to any of them. 

He stayed for one sleep period, 
and then left, after a grim struggle 
with his breakfast. 

No one had said anything about 

44 



the steel axes. 

He walked through the forest 
and the air was sweet and clean. It 
was darker now and the long shad- 
ows were less distinct. Sirius was 
only a glow of electric light in the 
west. It was strange, he thought. 
He, so close to that great star, 
could not see it. On Earth, light- 
years away across a sea of desola- 
tion, it was the Dog Star, the bright- 
est in the heavens. And the light 
that could be seen on Earth, by 
some boy and girl in a hovering 
copter, had left the star almost nine 
years before Bob Wistert had set 
foot on the seventh world of 
Sirius. 

He shivered in a growing twi- 
light hush. 



W 3EN he got home,- Helen was 
waiting for him. 

“I got the pictures,” he said, 
sinking down on the couch. 
“There’s no doubt of it now; I 
guess there never was.” 

“Tony came to see me,” she said. 
He sat up straight. “What did he 
want?” 

She fixed him a drink and put it 
in his hand. “He wanted us to come 
over for dinner when you got back. 
I didn’t let him in.” 

He knows. He must have seen 
me go. 

Helen moved about the room, 
giving a poor imitation of calm 
unconcern. “How now, Horatio? 
Do we ride into the valley of death, 
all two of us?” 

“Well, there’s only one of him.” 
“We’re going to go, then?” 

He hesitated. “First, I’m going 
to log a little sack time. Second, 
I’m going to take a bath. Third, 

CHAD OLIVER 




we’ll go over and sample the cuisine 
at Tony’s. Fair enough?” 

“I’d just as soon get it over 
with.” 

He finished his drink and ar- 
ranged himself on the couch, too 
tired to go to bed. He closed his 
eyes and waited for sleep. 

Sleep was slow in coming. 

Thoughts came instead. 

What is Thunderton up to? Is he 
going to ruin everything for all the 
people here? Is he going to ruin 
everything for us? Did Helen and 
I make a mistake in coming here? 
So many years to go — and what 
can we do? What can we do? 

He tossed restlessly on the couch. 
Impatiently, he tried to sleep, tried 
to relax his mind. 

The thoughts kept coming, nag- 
ging at him. 

Questions, memories, promises, 
fears — 

And dreams seemed very far 
away. 

In 1975, the first man set foot 
on the moon of Earth. 

Mars had been reached by 1981, 
and a landing had been made in 
1983. By the year 2000, the solar 
system had been pretty well ex- 
plored. It had proved to be fas- 
cinating, in much the same way as 
the Grand Canyon is fascinating. 
It was wild and good to look at, 
but it was desperately empty. 

Some fifty years later, in 2051, 
the first expedition got back from 
Centaurus. After that, a more 
practical interstellar drive was only 
a matter of time. In 2062, the first 
of the true starships was launched. 
It moved with a new kind of mo- 
tion through a new kind of space. 
It was more than just a faster 
spaceship, just as an airplane is 

NIGHT 



more than just a faster automobile. 

The starships were different. 

From 2062 until 2090 was the 
period of the initial investigation of 
the nearer star systems. Life had 
sought out life. 

One hundred and three Earth- 
like planets were found and there 
were humanoid peoples on every 
one of them. No planet was lo- 
cated that had a culture higher 
than Earth’s, at least in a tech- 
nological sense. As might have 
been suspected from Earth’s his- 
tory, Earth had specialized in tech- 
nological development. Out of the 
one hundred and three planets 
which had intelligent life, only 
seventeen had attained an agricul- 
tural, Neolithic culture — and none 
had passed beyond that stage. 

It became very clear why Earth 
had never been contacted from 
space. 

Earth needed a frontier, and 
now she had one. One hundred 
and three planets meant many 
things to many people, but first and 
foremost they meant a fantastic 
new market potential. They were a 
diot In the arm for a planet geared 
to production. 

Potentially. 

There were flies in the ointment. 

Centuries are long, and they are 
full. No mere record of explorar 
tions and inventions can tell you 
much about a century. People live 
and work and die, and sometimes 
a single day is too much for the 
historians. 

Earth had changed. It had to 
change, or there would have been 
no exploration of space. It had to 
change, or the first travelers to far 
Centaurus might have had no 
Earth to come back to. 

45 




Earth changed. 

You can’t sell a plow to a man 
who doesn’t know what agriculture 
is. You can’t sell a car to a man 
who has no roads. You can’t take a 
man’s money if he has never heard 
of money. You can’t produce for a 
market unless the market’s there. 

The new planets could not be 
profitable markets until they were 
further developed. Outright ex- 
ploitation, in Ae year 2100, was 
out of the question. Colonialism 
was a dead duck — and that was 
one duck nobody cared to dig up 
again. 

Okay. Where do we go from 
here? 

Socioculturology was a fairly well 
developed science ; it was quite 
possible to predict mass develop- 
ments under any given set of con- 
ditions. The scientists could deal 
with the situation — but the scien- 
tists didn’t make the policy. A long 
wrangle broke out in the United 
World Council. What was ethical? 
What was practical? How could 
the job be financed? 

Meantime, there the planets 
were. It was important to know 
more about the people who lived 
on them, and to maintain contact 
with them. Anthropologists went 
in for a year or so, and made their 
reports. But who was willing to go 
out in the middle of nowhere and 
stay there for twenty years, to es- 
tablish squatter’s rights for indus- 
try? It was economically unsound 
to rotate personnel; it took over a 
year to reach most of the planets, 
and it was expensive. Stations had 
to be maintained until teams could 
be lawfully sent into the area to 
develop markets. 

Who would go? It took more 

46 



than money to make a man leave 
his home for twenty years on an 
alien world. The man had to be 
qualified. It was no job for an ad- 
venturer. 

His job was to ‘really get to 
know’ the natives. That meant, in 
practice, that he met as many of 
them as he could within a very re- 
stricted area ; planets were big 
places. It was his job to maintain 
friendly relations. But under no 
conditions could he tamper with 
the native culture. He had to keep 
his hands off. 

This was their world, and they 
must be permitted to live their 
lives undisturbed — for the present. 

Bob Wistert turned on the couch. 
Why had he come, really? And 
Helen — what had she hoped to 
find here? 

We were going to live a new life, 
close to the land. We were going 
to start over, just the two of us. 

And now — 

Exhausted, he slept. He dreamed 
that Anthony Thunderton was 
coming at him with a steel axe that 
glinted in iced moonlight. 

When he awoke, it was dark 
enough to see faint stars in the sky, 
and there was no wind. 



A nthony thunderton 

met them at the door. 

“Come in,” he said. 

They stepped inside. The living 
room was lean and spare with sim- 
ple wooden furniture. It was not a 
cold room. There were bright rugs 
on the floor and the lights were soft 
gold. Over the fireplace was a 
painting of Thunderton’s wife; her 
rather broad face, dark hair and 
black eyes closely resembled Thun- 

CHAD OLIVER 




derton himself. 

“I’ll put the dinner on,” Thun- 
derton said. “We’ll eat in twenty 
minutes.” 

They sat silently, caught between 
anxiety and embarrassment. The 
house was neat and clean — surpris- 
ingly so, since Thunderton lived 
alone. He was back in three min- 
utes, with Martinis on a polished 
wooid tray. He handed them their 
drinks. 

“Here’s to continued good fel- 
lowship in our primitive wonder- 
land,” he said with a perfectly 
straight face. 

He served them dinner on an 
open porch; the bugs were kept 
out by a miniature force screen. 
They had tender white meat from 
a rabbit-like animal, green salad, 
and ears of com that Thunderton 
grew in a garden. When they had 
eaten, there was wine. 

Bob Wistert was tense and nerv- 
ous. There were a lot of years ahead 
of them. Sooner or later, they 
would have to get things straight. 
For his part, he wanted it to be 
sooner. Now. He watched Thun- 
derton carefully, wondering. De- 
spite his stoutness, Thunderton was 
not a big man — ^but he dominated 
the porch. He was not a man to 
fool with. Bob wasn’t at all sure 
how to proceed. 

Anthony Thunderton helped 
him. 

“I guess you’re wondering about 
the axes,” he said quietly. 

Bob hesitated, but Helen spoke 
up. “Yes,” she said. “We were.” 

With great deliberation, Thun- 
derton took out a cigar and lit it. 
His face was impassive. “There are 
many questions in the universe,” he 
said. “For example, what brought 

NIGHT 



you two all the way across space 
to this?” 

He waved his hand and the 
night came closer. There was no 
moon yet and the station made a 
small circle of light in the darkness. 
The black trees were still. On the 
edge of the sand the cool sea 
drummed with long, even beats. 

“Don’t change the subject, 
Tony,” Bob said. 

“All questions are one in the 
end,” Thunderton said. He smiled. 
“The hell with that, though. Sup- 
pose I tell you why you’re here.” 

“Suppose you do,” Bob said. 

Thunderton folded his powerful 
hands and clamped the cigar more 
firmly in his mouth. “I don’t know 
you very well, so you’ll have to al- 
low for errors. Still, I think I can 
hit it pretty close.” 

“We’re waiting,” Bob said, his 
irritation showing in his voice. 

“I’ll take you first, Mr. Wistert. 
I should hazard a guess that you 
are one of that strange breed 
known as the intense idealist. You 
probably write poetry or do some- 
thing equally foolish in your spare 
time. Naturally, you will compen- 
sate for this by insisting that you’re 
the most practical damned man 
that ever lived. You’re interested 
in our charming native friends out 
there in the woods — you think they 
have a unique way of life which 
must be preserved. You think of 
yourself as their protector. You re- 
gard Earth as phony, so you’ve 
trotted out here to live in the Great 
Outdoors — ^with all modem con- 
veniences, of course.” 

Bob leaned forward. “Listen, 
Mac, about one more crack out of 
you — ” 

Anthony Thunderton ignored 

47 




him. “And you, fair lady,” he said 
to Helen, “have always wondered 
why you weren’t satisfied with your 
life. You’ve built an intellectual 
wall around yourself because you 
don’t seem to fit anywhere. You’ve 
come out here with your man to 
find something you’ve never found. 
You won’t find it here, either. It’s 
in yourself if it’s anywhere.” 

Helen said nothing. 

Bob stood up. “If the ‘Boy Psy- 
chologist’ is through with his string 
of bromides, maybe we can get 
back to the axes.” 

“Maybe we can,” agreed Thun- 
derton, chewing his cigar. 

“Do you deny that you’ve been 
giving steel axes to the natives?” 

“Have you ever heard me deny 
it?” 

“Forget the double-talk. Do you 
admit it?” 

“Certainly. I’m proud of it, if it 
comes to that.” 

Bob stared at him. Thunderton 
sat there, calmly smoking his cigar. 
He might have said, “Why, yes, I 
often have prunes for breaHast.” 

“You must be stark staring 
nuts!” Bob said. 

“Thank you, sir. You are a bom 
diplomat.” 

Bob sat down again. He leaned 
forward, trying desperately to make 
contact with this man. “Look here, 
Tony. Don’t you realize that those 
axes will utterly destroy those peo- 
ple out there? Don’t you under- 
stand that they’re human too? 
Can’t you see that you’re ripping 
their lives apart, leaving them with 
nothing? Do you think you’re 
God?” 

“To answer the first and least 
emotional of your questions, I do 
realize that the axes will destroy 

48 



those people. That is my inten- 
tion.” 

Bob slammed his fist down on 
the table. “You won’t get away 
with it! You may be able to push 
those people around, but you can’t 
push me around.” 

“Most heroic,” Thunderton said. 
Carefully, he took a pistol out of 
his pocket and held it loosely in his 
hand. “I just don’t want you to 
get carried away,” he explained. 
“Rather good pun, if I do say so 
myself.” 

Bob looked at Helen, utterly at 
a loss for words. The man was in- 
sane, that was the only possible 
explanation — 

“Now,” Thunderton said, “if 
you will be good enough to pour 
yourself another glass of wine — 
don’t try throwing it in my face, by 
the way, as it annoys me — I’d like 
to tell you exactly how I intend to 
destroy the natives. After that. I’ll 
give you a short history lesson. 
After that, I’ll put the gun away 
and we shall see what we shall see.” 

Bob thought of several rash 
plans, but settled for doing as he 
was told. The wine, at any rate, 
was good. 

“Very well,” Thunderton said. 
“Here are the details. I think you’ll 
find them interesting.” 

Bob and Helen waited. 

Around them, the long, long 
night was only beginning. 

T hunderton replaced what 

was left of his cigar with a new 
one. 

“Steel axes are curious things,” 
he said with obvious relish. “You 
can chop down trees with them, 
bash in heads with them, or use 

CHAD OLIVER 




them for money. On many worlds, 
a steel axe is a wonderfully effec- 
tive new invention — a jump for- 
ward of maybe a hundred thousand 
years of time. On other worlds, a 
steel axe is a tiresome and out- 
moded antique. It sort of depends 
on where you are — or perhaps I 
should say when you are.” 

“We know all that,” Bob^ said. 
He was not pleased with himself 
for having said it, but he had been 
stung, and he wanted to sting back. 

“Our somewhat ignorant friends 
out there in the forest,” Thunder- 
ton said, jerking his thumb toward 
the dark wall of pinelike trees, “are 
still living in a stone-age culture. 
That means that their technology 
is pretty crude stuff, even if it did 
take the human animal the better 
part of a million years to get that 
far on Earth. A stone axe takes 
time to make, as you doubtless 
know, and flint has the unhappy 
property of shattering or losing its 
edge if you whack it into a tree too 
many times. A steel axe can save 
you a lot of time, it lasts longer, 
and it gets the job done more effi- 
ciently. Of course, that happens to 
be irrelevant.” 

“Why?” Helen asked. 
Thunderton grinned around his 
cigar. “I don’t give a hoot in hell 
how long it takes them to chop 
down a tree. I’m interested in 
knocking their culture apart in the 
quickest possible way.” 

Bob Wistert eyed the gun in 
Thunderton’s hand and shifted his 
weight on the chair. Why? Why is 
he trying to destroy them? Whafs 
in it for him? What kind of a man 
is he? What kind of a man — 
“Interesting business,” Thunder- 
ton said. “I’ve made quite a study 

NIGHT 



of it — can’t afford to make mis- 
takes, you know. There are two 
things about the native culture that 
are important. The first is that the 
society is set up in such a way that 
the old men, the tribal elders, run 
the show. They get the best food, 
the best women, and the best places 
around the fire. Those old buzzards 
are really powerful, too — their au- 
thority is real, and damned near 
absolute. Okay. I don’t care. That’s 
one way to do things. But look at 
this: the symbol of their authority 
is the stone axe. An old man is the 
only person who can own a stone 
axe. If a woman or a boy wants to 
use one, they have to go to ‘Old 
Man Mose’ and get his permission. 
There’s a complex taboo system 
thrown up around the stone axes, 
naturally. If you use one without 
permission, you’ve had it. It’s a 
cute system ; all the old men have 
to do is threaten to hold back the 
axes, and that’s all the power they 
need.” 

I knew those axes were impor- 
tant, But Tony knows more than I 
do. Is it too late to stop him? 

Thunderton puffed on his cigar. 
“The second important thing is 
that those axes have to be made 
out of a special kind of stone — and 
there are no such stones within 
two hundred miles of here. The 
old men have to trade for them. 
There’s a network of trade that al- 
most crosses this continent — and 
it’s based on area specialization in 
the manufacture of stone axes. The 
tribal elders around here supply 
wood for the handles — that’s all 
they do. Somebody else supplies 
the stone. Another tribe makes the 
axes. All the old men have trading 
partners in other villages, and reg- 

49 




ular trade routes they follow sea- 
sonally. Get the picture?” 

“I’m beginning to” Bob said 
quietly. 

“Let me fill in the details/’ 
Thunderton said. He smiled with 
genuine pleasure. “I go into this 
set-up with a crate or so of steel 
axes — I made ’em myself, by the 
way. I give the steel axes to the 
women and the young men. At 
first, they’re afraid to t^e them. I 
take them aside and explain to 
them — look, these aren’t stone axes! 
These aren’t sacred! They can’t 
hurt you — there are no taboos 
around them! Try ’em and see! 
Well, they do try them. No bolt of 
lightning strikes, they don’t get sick 
and die. And damned if they don’t 
work better than the old stone 
axes! Okay. The chain reaction 
starts. Nobody has to ask the per- 
mission of the old codgers any- 
more — they’ve got their own axes. 
The authority of the old men goes 
down the drain. The boys and 
young men stop giving the old men 
all the good deals. They figure 
they’re already big shots — they’ve 
got something the old men haven’t 
got. The stone axes are suddenly 
anachronisms. The old men get dis- 
couraged. Why make that long, 
hard trading expedition? Say! 
Maybe if they play their cards right 
they can get some of those new 
axes with the hard, sharp blades!” 

Thunderton crushed out his 
cigar. “That does it. A few steel 
axes, and presto! The whole web 
of tribal interrelationships breaks 
down — why trade for something 
useless? The power of the gods is 
challenged. The social organization 
collapses; the younger generation 
starts feeling its oats. In a word, 

50 



the old culture is kaput. Neat, eh?” 
“Yeah,” said Bob. “Neat.” 

Why has he done this thing? 
What kind of a man — 

“You spoke of a history lesson,” 
Helen said. 

Anthony Thunderton stood up, 
the gun still held loosely in his 
hand. He looked out into the night, 
toward the sand and the sea and 
the quiet. 

“Have you ever heard of the 
American Indian?” he asked. 

Nuts, Stark staring nuts. Or — 

He pointed the gun at Bob Wist- 
ert, casually. 

“Well?” 

“Come off of it, Tony. Of course 
I’ve heard of the American Indian. 
There’s a statue in Washington. 
We learn about them in school. 
People write novels about them.” 
“Hooray. What do you think of 
the Indian, Mr. Wistert?” 

Bob shrugged. “They were an 
interesting people. I guess they got 
a dirty deal. They were there first 
and all that.” 

Thunderton nodded. “I notice 
you use the past tense,” he said. “I 
suppose that’s the point, really. Did 
you find them quaint when you 
studied them, Mr. Wistert? Unique 
way of life? Sort of like the natives 
out there in the woods?” 

“I don’t know. That’s not a fair 
question. Anyway, I didn’t destroy 
them. That’s more than you can 
say, whatever you’re driving at.” 
“How do you know you didn’t?” 
“Look, I know you speak Eng- 
lish. Try a little and forget the 
riddles.” 

Thunderton sighed. “Time for 
the history lesson. Topic for to- 
night: The American Indian. Lis- 

CHAD OLIVER 




tening time: two minutes. Hang 
on, boys and girls.” 

“I don’t understand — ” 

“Be quiet, Bob,” Helen said. “Let 
him finish.” 

He looked at his wife in aston- 
ishment. 

“We’ll skip all the romantic guff, 
with your permission,” Thunder- 
ton said. “You know who the In- 
dians were, and you’ve heard all 
about the broken treaties and the 
smallpox. Okay. How about after 
all that was over? How about when 
everything was friendly, when the 
Indians weren’t a threat any 
longer? How about the reserva- 
tions and all the people who ad- 
mired the Indian ways of life?” 

“I’ll bite,” Bob said. “How 
about them?” 

“This about them: by the mid- 
dle of the twentieth century, most 
people did not hate the Indians. 
They were colorful, interesting. 
Many people tried to preserve what 
was left of the Indian cultures. 
Sure, maybe the reservation schools 
were poor and under-staffed. Sure, 
maybe an Indian kid had nothing 
to look forward to because he 
couldn’t get a good education and 
compete in the white world. Sure, 
maybe they were backward and 
caught in a trap. Didn’t they make 
pretty pots? Didn’t they weave col- 
orful blankets? Weren’t they fas- 
cinating?^^ 

Thunderton sat down and spun 
the pistol on his finger. “Oh, peo- 
ple meant well, all right. Nobody 
bothered to tell the Indian about 
real estate deals and mineral rights 
and stocks and bonds and con men. 
Nobody bothered to make sure he 
could stand on his own hind legs 
and fight for his rights after he be- 

NIGHT 



came a citizen. Nobody told him 
he might lose his land when he be- 
came ‘free’. Hell, education was 
expensive. It was easier to just turn 
him loose and hope for the best. 
People meant well, most of them. 
It was all very high-minded. But 
this is 2104. Where are the In- 
dians? Let’s see — there’s a statue in 
Washington, there’s that lovely 
novel about the wicked cavalry 
troopers — ” 

“I see what you mean,” Bob said. 
“But, those natives aren’t Indians, 
and this is 2104. We’ve learned a 
few things in the last century or so. 
They’re working out a fair pro- 
gram back there in the Council, 
they’ll figure out the right thing to 
do. I’m afraid I don’t get the con- 
nection. Your speech was pretty — 
but you^re the one who destroyed 
those natives.” 

Thunderton ignored him. “A 
few more points, Mr. Wistert. May- 
be the policy will be a dandy one; 
scientific and all that. Back in 
Spain, along about 1520, they had 
an enlightened policy toward the 
Indians. But it was a long way 
from Spain to Mexico; some of the 
boys with Cortez didn’t pay much 
attention to the nice policy. Okay. 
Suppose the policy they develop is 
a good one, and suppose, just for 
the hell of it, that it’s honored to 
the letter. So what? So they’ll come 
out here and tell those natives what 
to do — for the good of the natives, 
of course. Why not ask the natives 
what they want? Excuse me; I de- 
test idealists.” 

Thunderton poured himself a 
glass of wine with his free hand. 

“Get this,” he said. “Industry is 
coming out here, whether the na- 
tives like it or not. We’re here, and 

51 




they’ve got to change. I don’t say 
it’s right and I don’t say it’s wrong. 
That’s just the way it works, Mr. 
Wistert, I’ve got maybe thirty years 
before the teams come in on Sirius 
Seven. I can’t do much, and I 
can’t reach many of the people on 
this planet. But, by God, when 
those teams come in here, there 
are going to be a few natives 
around who know what the score 
is. They’re going to speak English, 
they’re going to know how money 
works, and they’re going to know 
about the law. They’re going to 
have a chance. After that, if they 
throw it away, that’s their busi- 
ness.” 

“But you’re tearing them apart!” 
Bob said. “You’re not teaching 
them anything.” 

“Mr. Wistert,” Thunderton said 
quietly, “it is sometimes necessary 
to destroy before you can build. 
The old men were very conserva- 
tive, and they ran the tribe. I had 
to give the young men a chance to 
change. There’s one group you 
haven’t seen yet. They may not be 
any wizards of finance, pal, but 
they know enough to get a lawyer.” 

“You’ll go to jail. You can’t set 
yourself above the law.” 

Thunderton laughed. 

“How do you know you’re right? 
Who are you to say you’re smarter 
than the United World Council?” 

“I never said I was right, Mr. 
Wistert. I do what I have to do. 
That’s all.” 

Anthony Thunderton put the 
pistol down on the table in front of 
him. He stood up. He turned his 
back on them and walked into his 
house, leaving them where they 
were. 

Bob Wistert picked up the pis- 
52 



tol, looked at it, and put it back on 
the table. 

“I don’t know what to do,” he 
said slowly. 

Helen got up and took his arm. 
“Come on, honey.” 

“Where are we going?” 

“Let’s take a walk.” 

He stood up. Together, they 
walked off the porch, feeling a 
tingle as they passed through the 
bug screen. They walked along a 
pathway under the pinelike trees, 
until there were no trees and there 
was only sand. 

They walked toward the sea. 

Bob Wistert tried to think. He 
didn’t understand. Why had Thun- 
derton done it? 

What kind of a man — 

T he sea was vast and lonely, 
silver-flecked beneath a million 
stars. It slid up the sand at their 
feet and made slow wet curves of 
phosphorescence and then whis- 
pered back to black depths and 
ageless currents. 

He tried to speak honestly, for- 
getting the hurt inside him. “Helen, 
we have twenty years ahead of us 
here, on this world, with this man. 
I don’t know whether he’s right or 
wrong. I don’t know what I should 
do, or shouldn’t do. We’ve got to 
think of ourselves.” 

“Yes. We must think of our- 
selves.” 

“I didn’t mean it that way.” He 
managed a smile. “Our pay is al- 
ready deposited on Earth ; that 
makes it easier to be brave.” 

She kissed him. “You have me. 
Bob. You just have to do what you 
think is right.” 

“I don’t know what’s right” 

CHAD OLIVER 




“Maybe there is no right or 
wrong here. Maybe there are just 
two different ways of doing things. 
Maybe nothing we do will make 
any difference in the end.” 

The night filled the world 
around them. It would be night 
for two hundred Earth-days. Out 
there, in the forests and the fields, 
another kind of night had begun 
for the peoples whose world this 
was. An ancient, bitter night of 
misery and despair. A cold night, a 
night of shadows and destruction. 

Still, the light would come again. 

Beyond every night there was a 
morning. 

“Who is he, Helen? Why has he 
come here?” 

“Look at his face, Bob. Look at 
his eyes and his hair. Look at that 
painting of his wife. It’s been al- 
most six hundred years since the 



first Indian met Cortez. That’s a 
long time — but not too long to re- 
member the white man.” 

Broad face, bronze skin, black 
hair, dark eyes — 

What kind of a man — 

“What are we going to do?” 

“I don’t know,” she said. “I 
haven’t got any answers, not now.” 
He hesitated. “We have twenty 
years to go. We can help him or 
not help him, but I hope we can 
be his friends.” 

“I know this,” she said quietly. 
“He is a lonely man.” 

They turned and put the dark 
sea behind them. Slowly, they 
walked through the sand toward 
the small light that burned in the 
trees. 

When they got back, Tony had 
the coffee ready, waiting for them.

BY FRANK RILEY 

THE CYBER and 

JUSTICE HOLMES 



Old Judge Anderson feared the inevitable — he 
was to be replaced by a Cyber! A machine that 
dealt out decisions free of human errors and 
emotions. What would Justice Holmes think? 



54 



C YBER JUSTICE!” That’s 

what the District Attorney had 
called it in his campaign speech 
last night. 

“Cyber justice!” 

Oh, hell! 

Judge Walhfred Anderson threw 
the morning fax paper on top of 
the law books he had been re- 
searching for the past two hours, 
and stomped angrily across his 
chamber to the door of the court- 
room. 

But it was easier to throw away 
the paper than the image of the 
words: 

“ — and, if re-elected, I pledge to 
do all in my power to help replace 
human inefficiency with Cyber jus- 
tice in the courts of this county! 



“WeVe seen what other counties 
have done with Cyber judges. 
We’ve witnessed the effectiveness 
of cybernetic units in our own Ap- 
pellate Division . And I can 
promise you twice as many prose- 
cutions at half the cost to the tax- 
payers . with modern, stream- 
lined Cyber justice!” 

Oh, hell! 

Walhfred Anderson caught a 
glimpse of his reflection in the oval 
mirror behind the coat rack. He 
paused, fuming, and smoothed 
down the few lingering strands of 
grey hair. The District Attorney 
was waiting for him out there. No 
use giving him the satisfaction of 
looking upset. Only a few moments 
ago, the Presiding Judge had visa-

phoned a warning that the D.A. 
had obtained a change of calendar 
and was going to spring a surprise 
case this morning . 

The Judge cocked his bow tie at 
a jaunty angle, opened the neck- 
line of his black robe enough for 
the pink boutonniere to peep out, 
and stepped into the courtroom as 
sprightly as his eighty-six years 
would permit. 

The District Attorney was an ex- 
football player, square-shouldered 
and square-jawed. He propelled 
himself to his feet, bowed per- 
functorily and remained standing 
for the Pledge of Allegiance. 

As the bailiff’s voice repeated 
the pledge in an unbroken mono- 
tone, Walhfred Anderson allowed 
his eyes to wander to the gold- 
framed picture of his personal 
symbol of justice, Oliver Wendell 
Holmes. Judge Anderson winked 
at Justice Holmes. It was a morn- 
ing ritual he had observed with- 
out fail for nearly fifty years. 

This wasn’t the classic picture of 
Justice Holmes. Not the leonine 
figure Walhfred Anderson had once 
seen in the National Gallery. The 
Justice Holmes on the wall of 
Judge Anderson’s courtroom was 
much warmer and more human 
than the official portrait. It was 
from an old etching that showed 
the Justice wearing a natty grey 
fedora. The Justice’s fabled mus- 
taches were long and sweeping, 
giving him the air of a titled play- 
boy, but his eyes were the eyes of 
the man who had said: “When I 
am dying, my last words will be — 
have faith and pursue the unknown 
end.” 

Those were good words to re- 
member, when you were eighty- 

56 



six. Walhfred Anderson stared 
wistfully at the yellowed etching, 
waiting for some other dearly re- 
membered phrase to spring up be- 
tween them. But Justice Holmes 
wasn’t communicative this morning. 
He hadn’t been for a long time. 

The District Attorney’s voice, 
threaded with sarcasm, broke into 
his reverie: 

“If the Court pleases, I would 
like to call up the case of People 
vs. Professor Neustadt.” 

Walhfred Anderson accepted the 
file from his aging, nearsighted 
clerk. He saw that the case had 
been assigned originally to Depart- 
ment 42. It was the case he had 
been warned about by the Presid- 
ing Judge. 

Walhfred Anderson struggled to 
focus all his attention on the com- 
plaint before him. His craggy fea- 
tures, once described as resembling 
a benign bulldog, grew rigid with 
concentration. The Judge had a 
strong sense of honor about divid- 
ing his attention in Court. A case 
was not just a case ; it was a human 
being whose past, present and fu- 
ture were wrapped up in the charge 
against him. 

“Your Honor,” the District At- 
torney broke in, impatiently, “if 
the Court will permit, I can sum- 
marize this case very quickly . .” 

The tone of his voice implied : 

A Cyber judge would speed 
things up around here. Feed the 
facts into the proprioceptor, and 
they’d be stored and correlated in- 
stantly. 

Perhaps so, Walhfred Anderson 
thought, suddenly tired, though 
the morning was still young. At 
eighty-six you couldn’t go on fight- 
ing and resisting much longer. 

FRANK RILEY 




Maybe he should resign, and lis- 
ten to the speeches at a farewell 
luncheon, and let a Cyber take 
over. The Gybers were fast. They 
ruled swiftly and surely on points 
of law. They separated fact from 
fallacy. They were not led down 
side avenues of justice by human 
frailty. Their vision was not 
blurred by emotion. And yet . 
Judge Anderson looked to Justice 
Holmes for a clarifying thought, 
but the Justice’s eyes were opaque, 
inscrutable. 

Judge Anderson wearily settled 
back in his tall chair, bracing the 
ache in his back against the leather 
padding. 

‘‘You may proceed,” he told the 
District Attorney. 

“Thank you, your Honor.” 

This time the edge of sarcasm 
was so sharp that the Clerk and 
Court Stenographer looked up in- 
dignantly, expecting one of the 
Judge’s famous retorts. 

The crags in the Judge’s face 
deepened, but he remained quiet. 

With a tight smile, the District 
Attorney picked up his notebook. 

“The defendant,” he began 
crisply, “is charged on three counts 
of fraud under Section 31 ...” 

“To wit,” rumbled Judge An- 
derson, restlessly. 

“To wit,” snapped the D.A., 
“the defendant is charged with giv- 
ing paid performances at a local 
theatre, during which he purported 
to demonstrate that he could take 
over Cyber functions and perform 
them more efficiently.” 

Walhfr^d Anderson felt the door 
closing on him. So this was why 
the D.A. had requested a change 
of calendar! What a perfect tie-in 
with the election campaign! He 

THE CYBER AND JUSTICE HOLMES 



swiveled to study the defendant. 

Professor Neustadt was an as- 
tonishingly thin little man; the 
bones of his shoulders seemed about 
to thrust through the padding of 
his cheap brown suit. His thinness, 
combined with a tuft of white hair 
at the peak of his forehead, gave 
him the look of a scrawny bird. 

“Our investigation of this defend- 
ant,” continued the D.A., “showed 
that his title was assumed merely 
for stage purposes. He has been 
associated with the less creditable 
phases of show business for many 
years. In his youth, he gained con- 
siderable attention as a ‘quiz kid’, 
and later, for a time, ran his own 
program and syndicated column. 
But his novelty wore off, and he 
apparently created this cybernetic 
act to . .” 

Rousing himself to his judicial 
responsibility. Judge Anderson in- 
terrupted : 

“Is the defendant represented 
by counsel?” 

“Your Honor,” spoke up Pro- 
fessor Neustadt, in a resonant, bass 
voice that should have come from 
a much larger diaphragm, “I re- 
quest the Court’s permission to act 
as my own attorney.” 

Walhfred Anderson saw the D.A. 
smile, and he surmised that the 
old legal truism was going through 
his mind : A man who defends him- 
self has a fool for a client. 

“If it’s a question of finances,” 
the Judge rumbled gently. 

“It is not a question of finances. 
I merely wish to defend myself.” 

Judge Anderson was annoyed, 
worried. Whoever he was or 
claimed to be, this Professor was 
evidently something of a crackpot. 
The D.A. would tear him to small 

57 




pieces, and twist the whole case 
into an implicit argument for Cy- 
ber judges. 

“The defendant has a right to 
act as his own counsel,” the D.A. 
reminded him. 

“The Court is aware of that,” 
retorted the Judge. Only the re- 
straining eye of Oliver Wendell 
Holmes kept him from cutting 
loose on the D.A. But one more re- 
mark like that, and he’d turn his 
back on the Justice. After all, what 
right had Holmes to get stuffy at a 
time like this? He’d never had to 
contend with Cyber justice! 

He motioned to the D.A. to con- 
tinue with the People’s case, but 
the Professor spoke up first: 

“Your Honor, I stipulate to the 
prosecution evidence.” 

The D.A. squinted warily. 

“Is the defendant pleading 
guilty?” 

“I am merely stipulating to the 
evidence. Surely the prosecution 
knows the difference between a 
stipulation and a plea! I am only 
trying to save the time of the Court 
by stipulating to the material facts 
in the complaint against me!” 

The D.A. was obviously dis- 
appointed in not being able to 
present his case. Walhfred Ander- 
son repressed an urge to chuckle. 
He wondered how a Cyber judge 
would handle a stipulation. 

“Do you have a defense to pre- 
sent?” he asked the Professor. 

“Indeed I do, your Honor! I 
propose to bring a Cyber into the 
courtroom and prove that I can 
perform its functions more effi- 
ciently!” 

The D.A. flushed. 

“What kind of a farce is this? 
We’ve watched the defendant’s 

58 



performance for several days, and 
it’s perfectly clear that he is merely 
competing against his own special 
Cyber unit, one with very limited 
memory storage capacity . 

“I propose further,” continued 
Professor Neustadt, ignoring the 
D.A., “that the prosecution bring 
any Cyber unit of its choice into 
Court. I am quite willing to com- 
pete against any Cyber yet de- 
vised!” 

This man was not only a crack- 
pot, he was a lunatic, thought 
Walhfred Anderson with an in- 
ward groan. No one but a lunatic 
would claim he could compete with 
the memory storage capacity of a 
Cyber. 

As always when troubled, he 
looked toward Oliver Wendell 
Holmes for help, but the Justice 
was still inscrutable. He certainly 
was being difficult this morning! 

The Judge sighed, and began a 
ruling: 

“The procedure suggested by the 
defendant would fail to answer to 
the material counts of the com- 
plaint . .” 

But, as he had expected, the 
D.A. did not intend to let this op- 
portunity pass. 

“May it please the Court,” said 
the District Attorney, with a wide 
grin for the fax reporter, “the 
people will stipulate to the defense, 
and will not press for trial of the 
complaint if the defendant can in- 
deed compete with a Cyber unit 
of our choice.” 

Walhfred Anderson glowered at 
the unsympathetic Justice Holmes. 
Dammit, man, he thought, don’t 
be so calm about this whole thing. 
What if you were sitting here, and 
I was up there in a gold frame? 

FRANK RILEY 




Aloud, he hedged: 

“The Court does not believe 
such a test could be properly and 
fairly conducted.” 

“I am not concerned with being 
fairly treated,” orated the wispy 
Professor. “I propose that five ques- 
tions or problems be posed to the 
Cyber and myself, and that we be 
judged on both the speed and ac- 
curacy of our replies. I am quite 
willing for the prosecution to select 
the questions.” 

Go to hell, Holmes, thought 
Judge Anderson. I don’t need you 
anyway. I’ve got the answer. The 
Professor is stark, raving mad. 

Before he could develop a rul- 
ing along this line, the grinning 
D.A. had accepted the Professor’s 
terms. 

“I have but one condition,” in- 
terposed the defendant, “if I win 
this test, I would like to submit a 
question of my own to the Cyber.” 
The D.A. hesitated, conferred in 
a whisper with his assistant, then 
shrugged. 

“We so stipulate.” 

Firmly, Walhfred Anderson 
turned his back on Oliver Wendell 
Holmes. 

“In the opinion of the Court,” 
he thundered, “the proposed dem- 
onstration would be irrelevant, im- 
material and without substantive 
basis in law. Unless the People pro- 
ceed with their case in the proper 
manner, the Court will dismiss this 
complaint!” 

“Objection!” 

“Objection!” 

The word was spoken simulta- 
neously by both the D.A. and the 
Professor. Then the defendant 
bowed toward the District Attor- 
ney, and asked him to continue. 

THE CYBER AND JUSTICE HOLMES 



F or one of the few times in his 
life, Walhfred Anderson found 
himself faced with the same objec- 
tion, at the same time, from both 
prosecution and defense. What a 
morning! He felt like turning the 
court over to a Cyber judge right 
here and now, and stomping back to 
his chambers. Let Holmes try get- 
ting along with a Cyber! 

The D.A.’s voice slashed into 
his thoughts. 

“The People object on the 
grounds that there is ample prec- 
edent in law for the type of 
court demonstration to which we 
have agreed ...” 

“For example,” spoke up the 
Professor, “People vs. Borth, 201 
N.Y., Supp. 47— 

The District Attorney blinked, 
and looked wary again. 

“The People are not familiar 
with the citation,” he said, “but 
there is no reason to be in doubt. 
The revised Judicial Code of Pro- 
cedure provides for automatic and 
immediate review of disputed 
points of law by the Cyber Ap- 
pellate Division.” 

CAD! Walhfred Anderson cus- 
tomarily used every legal stratagem 
to avoid the indignity of appear- 
ing before CAD. But now he was 
neatly trapped. 

Grumbling, he visaphoned the 
Presiding Judge, and was imme- 
diately assigned to Cyber V, CAD, 
fourth floor. 

Cyber V presided over a sunlit, 
pleasantly carpeted courtroom in 
the south wing of the Justice Build- 
ing. Square, bulky, with mat black 
finish, the Cyber reposed in the 
center of a raised mahogany stand. 
Its screen and vocader grill looked 
austerely down on the long tables 

59 




provided for opposing counsel. 

As Walhfred Anderson belliger- 
ently led the Professor and the 
D.A. into the courtroom. Cyber V 
hummed softly. A dozen colored 
lights on its front grid began to 
blink. 

Judge Anderson angrily repressed 
an instinct to bow, as he had done 
in his younger years when appear- 
ing to plead a case before a human 
Appellate Court. 

The Cyber’s soft, pleasantly mod- 
ulated voice said: 

“Please proceed.” 

Curbing his roiled feelings of 
rage and indignity, the Judge 
stepped to the stand in front of 
the vocader grill and tersely pre- 
sented the facts of the case, the 
reasons for his ruling. Cyber V 
blinked and hummed steadily, as- 
similating and filing the facts. 

The D.A. followed the Judge to 
the stand, and, from long habity 
addressed Cyber V with the same 
emotion and voice tricks he would 
have used in speaking to a human 
judge. Walhfred Anderson gri- 
maced with disgust. 

When the D.A. finished. Cyber 

V hummed briefly, two amber 
lights flickered, and the soft voice 
said: 

“Defense counsel will please take 
the stand.” 

Professor Neustadt smiled his 
ironic, exasperating smile. 

“The defense stipulates to the 
facts as stated.” 

The frontal grid lights on Cyber 

V flashed furiously; the hum rose 
to a whine, like a motor acceler- 
ating for a steep climb. 

Suddenly, all was quiet, and 
Cyber V spoke in the same soft, 
pleasant voice: 

60 



“There are three cases in mod- 
em jurisprudence that have direct 
bearing on the matter of People 
vs. Neustadt. 

“Best known is the case of 
People vs. Borth, 201 N.Y., Supp. 
47 . .” 

Walhfred Anderson saw the D.A. 
stiffen to attention as the Cyber 
repeated the citation given by Pro- 
fessor Neustadt. He felt his own 
pulse surge with the stir of a faint, 
indefinable hope. 

“There are also the cases of For- 
sythe vs. State, 6 Ohio, 19, and 
Murphy vs. U.S., 2d, 85 C.C.A. 

“These cases establish precedence 
for a courtroom demonstration to 
determine points of material fact. 

“Thank you, Gentlemen.” 

The voice stopped. All lights 
went dark. Cyber V, CAD, had 
rendered its decision. 

Whatever misgivings the D.A. 
may have generated over the Pro- 
fessor’s display of legal knowledge 
were overshadowed now by his 
satisfaction at this display of Cy- 
ber efficiency. 

“Eight minutes!” he announced 
triumphantly. “Eight minutes to 
present the facts of the case and 
obtain a ruling. There’s efficiency 
for you! There’s modern court- 
room procedure!” 

Walhfred Anderson felt the 
weight of eighty-six years as he 
cocked the angle of his bow tie, 
squared his shoulders and led the 
way back to his own courtroom. 
Maybe the new way was right. 
Maybe he was just an old man, 
burdened with dreams, memories, 
the impedimentia of human emo- 
tions. It would have taken him 
many long, weary hours to dig out 
those cases. Maybe the old way 

FRANK RILEY 




had died with Holmes and the 
other giants of that era. 

Details of the demonstration 
were quickly concluded. The D.A. 
selected a Cyber IX for the test. 
Evidently he had acquired a new 
respect for Professor Neustadt and 
was taking no chances. Cyber IX 
was a massive new model, used as 
an intergrator by the sciences. 
Judge Anderson had heard that its 
memory storage units were the 
greatest yet devised. 

If Professor Neustadt had 
also heard this, he gave no sign of 
it. He made only a slight, contemp- 
tuous nod of assent to the D.A.’s 
choice. 

For an instant, the Judge found 
himself hoping that the Professor 
would be beaten into humility by 
Cyber IX. The man’s attitude was 
maddening. 

Walhfred Anderson banged his 
gavel harder than necessary, and 
recessed the hearing for three days. 
In the meantime, a Cyber IX was 
to be moved into the courtroom 
and placed under guard. Professor 
Neustadt was freed on bail, which 
he had already posted. 

Court fax-sheet reporters picked 
up the story and ballooned it. The 
D.A.’s office released publicity 
stories almost hourly. Cartoonists 
created “Battle of the Century” 
illustrations, with Cyber IX and 
Professor Neustadt posed like 
fighters in opposite comers of the 
ring. “Man challenges machine” 
was the caption, indicating that 
the Professor was a definite under- 
dog and thus the sentimental fa- 
vorite. One court reporter con- 
fided to Judge Anderson that 
bookmakers were offering odds of 
ten to one on Cyber IX. 

THE CYBER AND JUSTICE HOLMES 



To the Judge’s continuing dis- 
gust, Professor Neustadt seemed as 
avid as the Prosecutor’s office for 
publicity. He allowed himself to 
be guest-interviewed on every a- 
vailable television show; one pro- 
gram dug up an ancient film of 
the Professor as a quiz kid, extract- 
ing cube roots in a piping, confi- 
dent voice. 

Public interest boiled. TV cov- 
erage of the court test was de- 
manded, and eagerly agreed to by 
both the Prosecutor and Professor 
Neustadt. Walhfred Anderson 
ached to cry out against bringing a 
carnival atmosphere into his 
courtroom; the fax photographers 
were bad enough. But he knew 
that any attempt to interfere would 
bring him back before that in- 
fernal CAD. 



HEN HE entered his court- 
room on the morning of the 
trial, the Judge wore a new bow tie, 
a flippant green, but he felt like 
many a defendant he had watched 
step up before his bench to receive 
sentence. After this morning, 
there’d be no stopping the D.A.’s 
campaign for Cyber judges. He 
glared unhappily at the battery of 
television cameras. He noted that 
one of them was pointed at Oliver 
Wendell Holmes. The Justice didn’t 
seem to mind; but who would — 
all safe and snug in a nice gold 
frame? Easy enough for Holmes to 
look so cocky. 

The bright lights hurt his eyes, 
and he had to steel himself in order 
to present the picture of dignified 
equanimity that was expected of 
a judge. People would be looking 
at him from every part of the 




61 




world. Five hundred million view- 
ers, one of the columnists had esti- 
mated. 

Professor Neustadt appeared in 
the same shiny brown suit. As he 
passed the huge Cyber IX unit, 
metallic gray and mounted on a 
table of reinforced steel, the Pro- 
fessor paused and bowed, in the 
manner of a courtly gladiator sa- 
luting a respected foe. Spectators 
clapped and whistled their ap- 
proval. Television cameras zoomed 
in on the scene. With easy show- 
manship, Professor Neustadt main- 
tained the pose for closeups, his 
owlish eyes wide and unblinking. 

Judge Anderson banged his 
gavel for order. What a poseur! 
What a fraud! This charlatan 
would get a million dollars worth 
of publicity out of the case. 

At a nod from the D.A., the 
bailiff gave Professor Neustadt a 
pad of paper on which to note his 
answers. It had been previously 
been agreed that Cyber IX would 
answer visually, on the screen, in- 
stead of by vocader. The Professor 
was seated at the far end of the 
counsel table, where he could not 
see the screen. Clerks with stop- 
watches were stationed behind the 
Professor and Cyber IX. 

“Is the defendant ready?” in- 
quired Judge Anderson, feeling 
like an idiot. 

“Of course.” 

The Judge turned to Cyber IX, 
then caught himself. He flushed. 
The courtroom tittered. 

The District Attorney had five 
questions, each in a sealed enve- 
lope, which also contained . an 
answer certified by an eminent 
authority in the field. 

With a flourish, keeping his pro- 

62 



file to the cameras, the D.A. handed 
the first envelope to Judge Ander- 
son. 

“We’ll begin with a simple 
problem in mathematics,” he an- 
nounced to the TV audience. 

From the smirk in his voice, 
Judge Anderson was prepared for 
the worst. But he read the ques- 
tion with a perverse sense of satis- 
faction. This Professor was in for 
a very rough morning. He cleared 
his throat, read aloud: 

“In analyzing the economics of 
atomic power plant operation, cal- 
culate ihe gross heat input for a 
power generating plant of 400 x 
10® watts electrical output.” 

Cyber IX hummed into instan- 
taneous activity; its lights flashed 
in sweeping curves and spirals 
across the frontal grid. 

Professor Neustadt sat perfectly 
still, eyes closed. Then he scribbled 
something on a pad of paper. 

Two stopwatches clicked about 
a second apart. The clerk handed 
the Professor’s slip of paper to 
Judged Anderson. The Judge 
checked it, turned to the screen. 
Both answers were indentical: 
3,920 X 10® BTU/hr. 

Time was announced as four- 
teen seconds for Cyber IX; fifteen 
and three-tenths seconds for Pro- 
fessor Neustadt. The Cyber had 
won the first test, but by an as- 
toundingly close margin. The court- 
room burst into spontaneous ap- 
plause for the Professor. Walhfred 
Anderson was incredulous. What 
a fantastic performance! 

No longer smirking, the D.A. 
handed the Judge a second enve- 
lope. 

“What is the percentage com- 
pressibility of caesium under 45,000 

FRANK RILEY 




atmospheres of pressure, and how 
do you account for it?” 

Once again Cyber IX hummed 
and flickered into action. 

And once again Professor Neu- 
stadt sat utterly still, head tilted 
back like an inquisitive parakeet. 
Then he wrote swiftly. A stop- 
watch clicked. 

Walhfred Anderson took the 
answer with trembling fingers. He 
saw the D.A. rub dry lips together, 
try to moisten them with a dry 
tongue. A second stopwatch 
clicked. 

The Judge compared the cor- 
rect answer with the Professor’s 
answer and the answer on the 
screen. All were worded differently, 
but in essence were the same. Hid- 
ing his emotion in a tone gruffer 
than usual, Judge Anderson read 
the Professor’s answer: 

“The change in volume is 17 
percent. It is due to an electronic 
transition for a 6s zone to a 5d 
zone.” 

The Professor’s elapsed time was 
22 seconds. Cyber IX had taken 31 
seconds to answer the compound 
question. 

Professor Neustadt pursued his 
lips; he seemed displeased with his 
tremendous performance. 

Moving with the agility of a pall- 
bearer, the D.A. gave Judge An- 
derson the third question: 

“In twenty-five words or less, 
state the Nernst Law of thermo- 
dynamics.” 

This was clearly a trick question, 
designed to trap a human mind in 
its own verbiage. 

Cyber IX won, in eighteen sec- 
onds. But in just two-fifths of a 
second more; Professor Neustadt 
came through with a brilliant 

THE CYBER AND JUSTICE HOLMES 



twenty-four word condensation: 

“The entropy of a substance be- 
comes zero at the absolute zero of 
temperature, provided it is brought 
to this temperature by a reversible 
process.” 

A tabulation of total elapsed 
time revealed that Professor Neu- 
stadt was leading by nine and 
three-tenths seconds. 

A wild excitement blended with 
the Judge’s incredulity. The D.A. 
seemed to have developed a tic in 
his right check. 

On the fourth question, dealing 
with the structural formula sim- 
ilarities of dimenhydrinate and di- 
phenhydramine hydrochloride. Pro- 
fessor Neustadt lost three seconds. 

On the fifth question, concern- 
ing the theoretical effects of hu- 
midity inversion on microwave 
transmission, the Professor gained 
back a full second. 

The courtroom was bedlam, and 
Walhfred Anderson was too ex- 
cited to pound his gavel. In the 
glass-walled, soundproofed tele- 
vision booths, announcers grew 
apoplectic as they tried to relay the 
fever-pitch excitement of the 
courtroom to the outside world. 

Professor Neustadt held up his 
bone-thin hand for silence. 

“May it please the Court . 
The District Attorney agreed that 
in the event of victory I could 
ask Cyber IX an optional ques- 
tion. I would like to do so at this 
time.” 

Judge Anderson could only nod, 
and hope that his bulldog features 
were concealing his emotions. The 
D.A. kept his back rigidly to the 
television cameras. 

Professor Neustadt -strutted up 
to Cyber IX, flipped on the voca- 

63 




der switch and turned to the cam- 
eras. 

“Since Cyber IX is essentially a 
scientific integrator and mathe- 
matical unit/’ he began pedanti- 
cally, “I’ll put my question in the 
Cyber’s own framework. Had an- 
other Cyber been selected for this 
test, I would phrase my question 
differently.” 

He turned challengingly back to 
Cyber IX, paused for dramatic 
effect, and asked: 

“What are the magnitudes of a 
dream?” 

Cyber IX hummed and twinkled. 
The hum rose higher and higher. 
The lights flickered in weird, dis- 
jointed patterns, blurring before 
the eye. 

Abruptly, the hum stopped. The 
lights dimmed, faded one by one. 

The eternally calm, eternally 
pleasant voice of Cyber IX spoke 
from the vocader grill: 

“Problem unsolved.” 



F or an interminable instant 
there was silence in the court- 
room. Complete silence. Stunned 
incredulity. It was followed by a 
collective gasp, which Walhfred 
Anderson could hear echoing 
around the world. Cyber IX had 
been more than beaten ; it had 
failed to solve a problem. 

The gasp gave way to unre- 
strained cheering. 

But the Professor brought quiet 
again by raising his bony hand. 
Now there was a strange, incon- 
gruous air of dignity about his thin 
figure. 

“Please,” he said, “please under- 
stand one thing . The purpose 
of this demonstration and my ques- 



tion was not to discredit Cyber 
IX, which is truly a great machine, 
a wonder of science. 

“Cyber IX could not know the 
magnitudes of a dream . be- 
cause it cannot dream. 

“As a matter of fact, I do not 
know the magnitudes of a dream, 
but that is not important . be- 
cause I can dream! 

“The dream is the difference 
. The dream born in man, as 
the poet said, ‘with a sudden, clam- 
orous pain’ . .” 

There was no movement or 
sound in the courtroom. Walhfred 
Anderson held the Professor’s last 
written answer between his fingers, 
as if fearing that even the small 
movement to release it might shat- 
ter something delicate and pre- 
cious. “The dream is the differ- 
ence!” There it was. So clear and 
true and beautiful. He looked at 
Holmes, and Holmes seemed to be 
smiling under his gray mustache. 
Yes, Holmes had known the dream. 

In the sound-proof booths, the 
announcers had stopped speaking; 
all mike lines were open to carry 
Professor Neustadt’s words to five 
hundred million people. 

“Perhaps there are no magni- 
tudes of such a dream ... no co- 
ordinates! Or it may be that we 
are not yet wise enough to know 
them. The future may tell us, for 
the dream is the rainbow bridge 
from the present and the past to 
the future.” 

Professor Neustadt’s eyes were 
half-closed again, and his head 
was cocked back, bird-like. 

“Copernicus dreamed a dream 
... So did da Vinci, Galileo and 
Newton, Darwin and Einstein . 
all so long ago .

“Cyber IX has not dreamed a 
dream . Nor have Cyber VIII, 
VII, VI, V, IV, III, II, I. 

“But they can free men to dream. 

“Remember that, if you forget 
all else: They can free men to 
dream ! 

“Man’s knowledge has grown 
so vast that much of it would be 
lost or useless without the storage 
and recall capacity of the Cybers 
— and man himself would be so 
immersed in what he knows that 
he would never have time to dream 
of that which he does not yet 
know, but must and can know. 

“Why should not the scientist use 
the past without being burdened 
by it? Why should not the lawyer 
and the judge use the hard- won 
laws of justice without being the 
slave of dusty law books?” 

Walhfred Anderson accepted the 
rebuke without wincing. The re- 
buke for all the hours he had 
wasted because he had been too 
stubborn to use a Cyber clerk, or 
consult Cyber V. The old should 
not resist the new, nor the new 
destroy the old. There was the let- 
ter of the law, and there was the 
spirit, and the spirit was the dream. 
What was old Hammurabi’s 
dream? Holmes had quoted it once. 
“ ... to establish justice on the 
earth ... to hold back the strong 
from oppressing the feeble ... to 
shine like the sun-god upon the 
blackheaded men, and to illumine 
the land . .” Holmes had dreamed 
the dream, all right. He had 
dreamed it grandly. But maybe 
there was room for small dreams, 
too, and still time for dreams when 
the years were so few and lonely. 

The Professor suddenly opened 
his eyes, and his voice took on the 

THE CYBER AND JUSTICE HOLMES 



twang of steel under tension. 

“You are already wondering,” 
he told the cameras accusingly, 
“whether I have not disproved my 
own words by defeating Cyber IX. 
“That is not true. 

“I defeated Cyber IX because I 
have wasted a man’s life — my own! 
You all know that as a child I was 
a mnemonic freak, a prodigy, if 
you prefer. My mind was a filing 
cabinet, a fire-proof cabinet neatly 
filled with facts that could never 
kindle into dreams. All my life I 
have stuffed my filing cabinet. For 
sixty years I have filed and filed. 

“And then I dreamed one 
dream — my first, last and only 
dream. 

“I dreamed that man would mis- 
use another gift of science, as he 
has mis-used so many ... I 
dreamed of the Cybers replacing 
and enslaving man, instead of free- 
ing man to dream . And I 
dreamed that the golden hour 
would come when a man would 
have to prove that he could re- 
place a Cyber — and thereby prove 
that neither man nor Cybers 
should ever replace each other.” 
Professor Neustadt turned to 
Judge Anderson, and his voice 
dropped almost to a whisper. 

“Your Honor, I move that this 
case be dismissed.” 

The worn handle of his old teak- 
wood gavel felt warm and alive 
to the Judge’s fingers. He sat up 
straight, and banged resoundingly 
on the top of his desk. 

“Case dismissed.” 

Then, in full view of the cam- 
eras, Walhfred Anderson turned 
and winked boldly at Oliver Wen- 
dell Holmes. • • •

S NOW BEAT against the tall 
windows of the terminal build- 
ing. The howling of the wind 
around the corners of the building 
and across the broad expanse of 
the rocket field went unheard by 
the thousands who streamed across 
the crowded floor. Each was in- 
tent on his or her affairs, hurrying 
to board one of the tall spires out 
on the snow covered field, seeing 
someone off, or waiting for incom- 
ing friends. 

Roger Lorin and his wife waited 
near the entrances to the boarding 
tunnels for the announcement that 
would send them out under the 
field to their rocket. The shouts of 
porters and the voices of excited 
passengers mingled with the noises 
of the terminal. Groups of people 
moved across the floor like the cur- 
rents of the ocean. 

Suddenly, the announcer’s voice 
boomed out over the p. a. “All pas- 
sengers for the Arctic City rocket 
report to tunnel seven.” 

“Come on Linda,” Roger said. 
“That’s our ship.” He hurried his 
wife toward the tunnel entrance. A 
few minutes later they stepped off 
the conveyer walk at the bottom 



66 





of an elevator shaft. The gray uni- 
formed attendant checked their 
tickets, before the glass cage lifted 
them to the lock entrance high on 
the side of the rocket. The wind 
sang its mournful song around the 
corners of the cage and fired vol- 
leys of snow against the glass. At 
the air lock entrance, a stewardess 
checked their tickets a second time. 

“Couches 34 and 35? Follow me, 
please.” She led them up one deck 
and over to a pair of couches, one 
of which was next to a small eye- 
port. 

“Take the one next to the port, 
honey,” said Roger. “The view’s 
worth seeing.” 

A moment later, a buzzer 
sounded, and a red light flashed on 
near the hatch to the deck above. 
The voice of the pilot came over 
the intercom system. 

“We are blasting off in five min- 
utes. All passengers who have not 
strapped in will please do so im- 
mediately.” Three minutes went 
by, and the final warning buzzer 
sounded. After another two min- 
utes, the rumble of the motors 
came from the tail of the ship. The 
rocket, a towering silver needle 
with orange flame spouting from 
its lower end, paused on the field 
as its motors warmed up. Then it 
rose majestically on a column of 
fire and disappeared in the swirl- 
ing snow. 

Linda was surprised to find that 
the sound of the blast off was not 
as loud as she had expected. Nei- 
ther did she find the acceleration 
of two and a half gravities exces- 
sively uncomfortable. The brightly 
lighted compartment made the 
scene outside the eyeport seem 
dark; although it was only four- 



67 



thirty in the afternoon. Tiny pellets 
of snow streamed by the port dur- 
ing the few seconds it took the 
rocket to scream through the lower 
atmosphere. Then the ship burst 
through the clouds. Linda gave an 
exclamation of surprise and pleas- 
ure at the sheer beauty of the sight. 
The clouds rose like tumbled snowy 
mountain ranges under an ice blue 
winter sky. The setting sun painted 
their tops in brilliant hues of pink, 
orange, and violet. Their eastern 
sides lay in blue shadow honey- 
combed with caves and grottos. 

“It’s beautiful!” exclaimed Lin- 
da. “I never dreamed it would be 
like this.” 

“You have to see it to really ap- 
preciate it,” Roger said. “Descrip- 
tions never do it justice.” 

As the rocket continued to rise, 
the clouds flattened until they re- 
sembled pack ice on an arctic sea. 
More of Earth became visible, and 
spots of green and brown appeared 
on the southwestern horizon. Final- 
ly the blue of the Pacific crept into 
view, brilliantly contrasted against 
the now black sky. 

“You may be able to see a few 
stars if you don’t look toward Earth 
or the sun,” Roger said to Linda. 
Linda followed Roger’s instruc- 
tions; and, sure enough, a few stars 
appeared, unwinking points of 
light against black velvet. Now 
over three hundred miles above 
Earth, the rocket had crossed the 
frontier into outer space. 

The rocket passed the top of its 
arc and the scenery was forgotten; 
the natural fear of falling to which 
all humans are heir asserted itself. 
Linda suddenly realized that there 
was no sensation of weight and 
that the rocket was falling steadily 

68 



through space. 

“Is ... is everything all right?” 
she asked in a weak voice. 

“Don’t worry dear,” Roger re- 
plied soothingly. “We’ll be landing 
in another half hour. You won’t 
have to go through much more of 
it.” 

“Thank goodness!” Linda 
breathed a sigh of relief and laid 
her dark head on Roger’s shoulder. 
Roger put his arm around her and 
held her until the rocket came in 
with a squeal of runners against 
hard packed snow. Lights flashed 
by the eyeport as they slid along 
the runway. In the distance the 
lighted, slablike towers of Arctic 
City loomed against the dark sky. 
The night was clear and bitterly 
cold. 

The rocket slid to a stop, and an 
electric tractor came to tow the 
ship to the top of an elevator shaft. 
A few minutes later the passengers 
streamed along a conveyer walk 
into the Arctic City terminal. The 
sounds of hurried activity echoed 
through the tunnel. The rumble of 
heavy freight conveyers, the shouts 
of stevedores, the whine of heavily 
loaded electric motors, and the 
hum of conversation mingled in a 
medley of sounds that spoke of 
commerce and industry, of people 
busy at an almost endless array of 
tasks. 

“Are you Roger Lorin?” The 
question came from a short, stocky, 
gray-haired individual. 

“Yes, I am,” Roger replied. 

“I’m Jacob Darcy. I’m supposed 
to show you to your apartment and 
help you get oriented.” ; 

“Good,” Roger said. “You lead. 
We’ll follow.” Darcy turned and 
led them to a small electric mono- 



LEE B. HOLUM 




rail car which sped them through 
a maze of underground streets past 
the windows of many shops and 
stores. 

After a ten minute ride in the 
monorail and a fast ascent in an 
elevator, the three of them entered 
a small apartment high in one of 
the slablike buildings. The apart- 
ment was comfortable and com- 
pact, though not luxuriously fur- 
nished. One transparent wall of the 
living room looked out over the 
city and the arctic landscape. 

“I thought things would be more 
primitive,” said Linda as she 
looked around her future home. 
“This doesn’t seem like a frontier 
at all.” 

“No,” Darcy replied with a 
smile. “Arctic City is pretty well 
built up. Conditions are a lot better 
here than they are in some of the 
mining centers farther north.” He 
turned to Roger. “Til be around 
tomorrow morning to show you the 
labs. Sometime around eight or 
eight thirty.” 

“I’ll be ready,” replied Roger. 
“It should be interesting to see the 
facilities here.” 

“I suppose the high temperature 
work will be most interesting to 
you,” said Darcy. “I read your pa- 
per on molecular linkages. We’ll 
sure be able to use you. We’re hav- 
ing the devil’s own time with the 
linings for the reaction chambers in 
the neutron pile.” 

“I hope I can help,” said Roger. 
“The cooling problem should be 
quite a challenge without the ex- 
treme temperatures and high 
vacuum that we had at the moon 
labs.” 

“That’s right. You did work on 
the first neutron pile, didn’t you?” 

THE THIRD PARTY 



Darcy said as he prepared to leave. 
“That makes it much better. There 
are too few men with practical ex- 
perience in neutron pile work.” 

It had long been known by 
physicists that tremendous amounts 
of energy could be released if mat- 
ter could be collapsed to form neu- 
trons. This step had been achieved 
in 2047 A. D., at the Lunar atomic 
laboratories. The Arctic City pile 
was the first attempt to apply it to 
industrial uses. 

Up to this time (2054) , man had 
been barred from the planets by the 
lack of a fuel cheap enough to make 
trips across interplanetary space 
economically feasible. Long, eco- 
nomical orbits could be used; but 
these brought on psychological 
problems resulting from living in 
cramped quarters for long periods 
of time, and problems of carrying 
enough supplies for such long trips. 
In shorter orbits, the profits would 
be burned up in excessive fuel con- 
sumption. The most efficient fuel 
was monatomic hydrogen, which is 
highly unstable unless dissolved in 
a catalyst to keep it from exploding 
at ordinary temperatures. The cat- 
alyst and the process for making 
the fuel were both expensive. Moon 
colonies were maintained only be- 
cause the moon was the best known 
source of germanium; and its 
vacuum was a valuable location for 
astronomical observatories and 
atomic research laboratories. 

The neutron pile applied to 
space travel would make an inter- 
planetary civilization possible. The 
pile, releasing neutrons and ions at 
velocities approaching that of light, 
would make use of small amounts 
of inexpensive materials as fuels. 

It also had frightening potential- 

69 




ities for mass destruction. 

The ambassador of the South 
American Republic thought of the 
destructive possibilities as he rode 
the small monorail car toward the 
Government Center in Chicago, 
which was now the capital of the 
North American Union. The shore 
of Lake Michigan was studded 
with tall skyscrapers connected by 
streets with transparent coverings. 
At ground level, a system of con- 
veyer walks ranging from the hun- 
dred mile per hour strips in the 
center to five mile per hour strips 
on the edges, whisked brightly clad 
people about their business. On the 
second level, monorail tracks car- 
ried the high speed freight and 
passenger traffic of the city. The 
ambassador’s car pulled in at a 
second level siding near the load- 
ing platform for the Government 
Tower. As he stepped from his car, 
he was met by two secret service 
agents who escorted him to the of- 
fice of the Secretary of State. 

The Secretary sat behind a large 
desk in a comfortably furnished of- 
fice on the eightieth floor. Through 
the large window wall behind the 
Secretary, the scattered towers of 
the city were somewhat obscured 
by flying snow and the gloom of a 
December morning. 

The distinguished looking man 
behind the desk had served his 
country well during the past thirty 
years. He knew the problems faced 
l3y such nations as the South Amer- 
ican Republic, the League of Islam, 
the Asian Commonwealth, the de- 
cadent subject nations of western 
Europe, and the tiny, constantly 
warring states that comprise what 
was left of the once mighty U.S.S.R. 
That morning he had sent a note 



refusing help to the Baltic Federa- 
tion, which had accused the Arctic 
League of aggression. The North 
American Union had no desire to 
enter foreign wars that did not con- 
cern it. 

The Secretary rose and extended 
his hand. 

“Good morning,” he greeted the 
ambassador as he shook hands with 
him. “Have a seat.” The Secretary 
waved toward a comfortable chair 
near the desk. The ambassador 
seated himself with his overcoat 
across his knees. 

“I cannot get used to your cold 
weather,” he said good naturedly. 
I have spent too much time in the 
tropics.” 

“We seem to be getting an un- 
usually cold winter,” the Secretary 
replied. “I’ll have to admit that 
Chicago doesn’t compare with Rio 
as far as weather is concerned.” 

“I wish that I were there now,” 
the ambassador said in a more seri- 
ous tone. “I would not have to dis- 
cuss with you this trouble that has 
come up.” 

“What trouble?” the Secretary 
asked. “Your note wasn’t clear 
about what you wished to discuss 
with me.” 

“As you probably know, there 
are groups in my country that fear 
the technical developments that 
have been going on during the 
past ten years,” the ambassador re- 
plied. “They do not know your 
country as well as I do, and fear 
that you will use the neutron energy 
discovery as a weapon.” 

“Why should they fear our 
energy developments?” the Secre- 
tary asked. “The Lunar atomic 
laboratories are open for inspection 
at all times, and the pile being built 

LEE B. HOLUM 



70 




in the Arctic is no secret either. All 
the developments are private ven- 
tures. The idea of making neutron 
bombs hasn’t even been raised in 
Congress.” 

“Unfortunately my people do 
not know this,” replied the ambas- 
sador. “These groups have used 
much propaganda and have thor- 
oughly misled the masses. That the 
laboratories are located on the 
moon does not help. You know 
how rigid the requirements are for 
those who would travel in space. 
Several men from my country have 
not been allowed to go for health 
reasons. This naturally feeds the 
suspicions of my people, who do 
not understand why such things 
must be done. To remedy this trou- 
ble my government has instructed 
me to arrange for a meeting be- 
tween our presidents.” 

“I think such a meeting would 
be possible,” the Secretary said. 
“I’m sure that the president will 
understand the situation. The 
memory of the twentieth century 
won’t fade easily. I’ll see if a trip 
to the Lunar laboratories can be 
arranged. It would be good if some 
members of the dissatisfied groups 
were allowed to make the trip.” 

“That would be very good,” re- 
plied the ambassador. “It would 
help to counteract their propagan- 
da. They are seeking power, and 
would gain it at the expense of 
good will between our nations. This 
will very effectively remove the 
source of their grievances.” 

“I’ll bring it up at the cabinet 
meeting this afternoon,” the Secre- 
tary said. “It would be wisest to get 
this business moving as fast as pos- 
sible.” 

The ambassador rose from his 



seat. “You will let me know the 
outcome of the meeting as soon as 
you can?” 

“Yes,” replied the Secretary. “As 
soon as it’s over.” 



T he laboratories at 

Arctic City were fairly new but 
already had the cluttered appear- 
ance of all research labs. Electronic 
instruments, coils of wire, and vari- 
ous articles of chemical apparatus 
lay on the work benches. One room 
held the dial-studded face of a 
computer. Another contained sev- 
eral induction and carbon arc fur- 
naces used in high temperature 
work. Men wearing white smocks 
or plastic aprons went quietly and 
efficiently about their tasks. 

Roger and Darcy entered a lab 
in which a man sat staring at the 
face of an oscilloscope, where weird 
figures danced in yellowish-green 
tracery. The bench was covered 
with a bewildering array of equip- 
ment. A row of gas discharge tubes 
glowed with varicolored light. 
From them a spaghetti-like ar- 
rangement of many colored wires 
led to various instruments scattered 
along the bench. 

“How’s it coming, Phil?” Darcy 
asked. 

The man looked up from his 
work. “Hi, Jake,” he said. “I might 
get somewhere if this oscillator 
would stop wandering all over the 
place. This thing doesn’t seem to 
be very accurate at high frequen- 
cies.” He indicated a piece of 
equipment connected to Ae oscil- 
loscope. 

“I’ll sure be glad when we get a 
good physical chemist to do this 
work. My business is ceramics, and 



THE THIRD PARTY 



71 




I’m getting sick and tired of wres- 
tling with his wiring.” 

“Well,” said Darcy, “you won’t 
have to worry about this any more. 
This is Roger Lorin, our new phys- 
ical chemist. Roger, this is Philip 
Gordon, our ceramics expert.” 
Gordon grinned and extended 
his hand. “I’m glad to meet you,” 
he said. “Sorry I blew off like that. 
I just get disgusted sometimes.” 

“It does get frustrating,” Roger 
agreed as they shook hands. “Elec- 
tronics is rather tricky.” 

“You’re right there,” replied 
Gordon. “Especially when you 
don’t know too much about it. 
What I learned about electronics 
in college has long since departed. 
Take a look at this set up. It’s 
about as poor a job of haywiring 
as you’ll find anywhere.” 

“I see you’re using high fre- 
quency excitation to get your high 
temperatures,” Roger commented. 
“Just what compounds are you 
working with?” 

“I’ve been working with some 
plastics, inert stuff, to see just what 
they’ll react with, and how fast 
they’ll react at high temperatures.” 
“It isn’t too easy,” Lorin said. 
“It never has been easy to find re- 
action rates. I’ll get to work on 
these this afternoon. Maybe I can 
get some of these finished tomor- 
row or the next day.” 

“Thanks,” Gordon said in a re- 
lieved voice. “It’ll be good to get 
some results I can rely on.” 

Lorin and Darcy left the lab and 
walked through a winding succes- 
sion of corridors until they came to 
a large room. One wall was lined 
with catwalks linked by metal lad- 
ders. Men in coveralls moved 
against the slate gray backgroimd 

72 



like insects on the side of a build- 
ing. Through a door to their right 
Lorin could see banks of instru- 
ments at which several men were 
working. 

“This is the south face of the 
pile,” Darcy said. “Most of the in- 
struments are located here. The 
Klysten converters are mounted in 
that room over there.” He indi- 
cated a door on their left. 

“I’d like to see those,” Roger 
said. “I hear that these are pretty 
large compared with what we had 
at the moon labs.” 

“They’re big enough all right,” 
Darcy said. “Each one is four 
stories high. We had a deuce of a 
time evacuating them.” 

As Darcy said this, they stepped 
into a long high room. To their 
right stood six immense transpar- 
ent tubes. Each tube contained a 
grid of thick steel bars which was 
mounted so that it completely sur- 
rounded a coil of heavy copper bar 
in the center of the tube. The steel 
bars had been treated so that a 
magnetic field would build up rap- 
idly when they were exposed to 
hard radiations. The radiation 
beams were passed into the grid in 
pulses, thus causing the magnetic 
field to build up and collapse rapid- 
ly producing current in the coils 
by induction. The tubes were gen- 
erators with no moving parts ex- 
cept electrons and protons. The 
system used about seventy-five per 
cent of the energy produced by the 
pile. The residual radiation was re- 
leased as greenish yellow light. 

“Why are they transparent?” 
Roger asked. “I should think that 
metals would be stronger and easier 
to manage.” 

“The transparency helps us to 
LEE B. HOLUM 




maintain a more accurate control ” 
Darcy replied. “When the light 
shifts toward the blue, we know 
that more energy is being released 
as radiation, and can shut down 
the tube before it gets a chance to 
heat up too much.” 

“Good idea,” said Roger. “Con- 
trol was our worst trouble at the 
moon labs.” 

“We’ll use this until we find 
something better,” said Darcy as 
they left the pile area. 

U SfKNOWN to Roger Lorin, 
events which would shape the 
course of the next few weeks, and 
would ultimately change his whole 
life were taking place far to the 
south. A third party had entered 
the political stage of the Western 
Hemisphere. The League of Islam 
had finally decided to do something 
about an incident which it had 
never forgiven. Over thirty years 
earlier, the Union had sent marines 
into the Suez Canal area to stop 
alleged assaults against American 
citizens. In a sense, the North 
American Union had indicated 
that it thought of the League of 
Islam as nothing more than a back- 
ward group, which could be paci- 
fied whenever trouble arose within 
its borders. The insult had never 
been forgotten by the fanatically 
nationalistic Moslems. Only the 
greater military might of the North 
American power had prevented a 
war at that time. Now, the League 
had decided that the time was ripe 
to gain immunity from such insults 
forever by some shrewd political 
maneuvering. 

Working through a small dis- 
satisfied political party in South 

THE THIRD PARTY 



America, they used the North’s de- 
velopment of neutron energy to 
create fear in the minds of the peo- 
ple of the southern republic. By 
stimulating this fear, the Arabs 
hoped to weaken both powers 
through war, and thereby to gain 
power and prestige among the na- 
tions. The League hoped to gain 
through political devices what it 
could never get in open war. 

Up to January 5, 2055, the lead- 
ers of the western hemispheric 
powers did not realize what was 
actually taking place. But then re- 
ports began coming into the offices 
of the investigators of both nations 
which changed the picture. 

On January 2, an American oil 
well in the Gulf of Mexico had 
been blown up. The saboteur was 
not caught, since the bomb had 
been cleverly hidden sometime be- 
fore the explosion. Two days later, 
in the state of Venezuela, an of- 
ficial of the South American gov- 
ernment was shot and killed. Al- 
though the assassin escaped after a 
grueling two day chase and was 
never really identified, there were 
plenty of rumor mongers to remind 
the people that the dead official 
had held opinions that were not 
favorable to the North American 
Union. Accompanied by such inci- 
dents friction between the two na- 
tions grew. 

The events that set the pot to 
boiling, and nearly caused it to boil 
over occurred at Arctic City. Up to 
this time, Roger Lorin had consid- 
ered the reports of such incidents 
as news that seemed rather unreal, 
because of its distance from his 
immediate affairs. Now, however, 
he found himself in the middle of 
the trouble between the two na- 



73 




tions. Although he scarcely knew it, 
he had become a key man on the 
neutron pile project. His research 
into the physics of interatomic and 
intermolecular forces had aided 
materially the work on the pile. 

It started, innocently enough, 
during the early afternoon of Janu- 
ary 9, when a group of ten men 
ostensibly bound for a mining town 
farther north, took a guided tom* 
of the pile area. About one sixth of 
the reaction cells into which the 
pile was divided for convenience, 
were in operation; and the six con- 
verter tubes were aglow with green- 
ish yellow light. The entrance of 
the men into the central chamber 
was the signal. A previously planted 
bomb exploded with enough vio- 
lence to shatter the tubes; filling the 
converter room with greenish yel- 
low fire and hard radiations. 

A smoke bomb provided extra 
screening and the group hurried 
down a side tunnel under cover of 
the gray mantle. Roger heard the 
sounds of confusion accompanied 
by the clangor of an alarm bell, an- 
nouncing that hard radiations were 
loose somewhere in the plant. He 
stepped to the door of the lab, and 
a gas gun exploded in his face. He 
knew nothing more, until he awoke 
aboard a fast moving jet. 

The convertiplane winged 
through the Arctic twilight for 
nearly two hours, and finally came 
down on a flat stretch of snow 
covered tundra, near the shore of 
the Arctic Ocean. A group of three 
dome huts stood at the base of a 
low cliff. Otherwise, the scene was 
one of silent, dark desolation. 

One of the men handed Roger a 
pair of insulated, electrically heated 
coveralls. Roger put them on with- 

74 



out argument. Next, the man mo- 
tioned toward the hatch with a 
machine pistol. “Get movin’,” he 
snapped. “Make it quick. And don’t 
try to run for it. You wouldn’t get 
far.” 

Roger dropped through the 
hatch and waited quietly. When 
his captors finally dropped through 
the hatch, they steered him none 
too gently toward the middle hut. 

On his right as he entered, three 
men sat playing cards around a 
small table. To his left, a man lay 
on a cot reading a magazine by the 
light of a mining lantern. Roger 
was shoved across the main room, 
through a passageway and into a 
room on the right. The metal door 
clanged shut behind him, and the 
bolt shot home with the finality of 
a prison gate. 

“Well, I see I have company,” a 
voice came out of the gloom. As 
Roger’s eyes grew accustomed to 
the dimness, he saw an old man 
sitting on the edge of a narrow cot. 

“Who are you?” Roger asked in 
a bewildered voice. “And just 
what’s been going on? Why should 
I be kidnapped and brought to this 
God forsaken spot?” 

“You must be the chemist they 
were talking about,” the old man 
replied. “I heard them say some- 
thing about one of the chief chem- 
ists at the neutron pile project. As 
for me, my name is Dr. Alexander 
Nolan. I came up here in my plane 
about a month ago to write up 
some historical research I’ve been 
doing during the past five years. In- 
stead, your kidnappers came in and 
took over. But here I am rambling 
on about myself as usual. What’s 
your name, young fellow?” 

“I’m Roger Lorin,” Roger re- 

LEE B. HOLUM 




plied. “I’m a chemist all right. I 
was working at Arctic City on the 
neutron project, but I still can’t 
figure out why I should be kid- 
napped. They couldn’t get any ran- 
som, and I don’t have any informa- 
tion that would be useful to them. 
I just don’t see it.” 

“Roger Lorin, eh,” the historian 
mused. “I think I see why you were 
kidnapped. You’re more important 
than you think you are, which is 
unusual. Most men think that they 
are more important than they real- 
ly are. I suppose you’ve heard 
about the oil well that was blown 
up in the Gulf of Mexico and the 
man who was shot and killed down 
in Venezuela. Now, if some North 
American Citizen were to be found 
dead, possibly tortured for informa- 
tion about the neutron pile, it 
might be just the spark that sets 
off the powder keg that’s been 
building up during the past ten 
years.” 

“But why should South America 
do anything like that?” Roger 
asked nervously. “They have noth- 
ing to gain by such actions. We’ve 
shared the information on pile de- 
velopments since the projects were 
started.” 

“Oh, but South America is not 
the power behind this business,” 
Nolan said gently. “I’ll admit that 
the evidence seems to point to 
South America, but I have reasons 
to believe that another power is 
behind this.” 

“But which one could it be?” 
asked Roger. 

“Indications point to the League 
of Islam,” replied Nolan. “They 
are clever, but a student of political 
history can get some insight into 
their plans if he looks carefully 

THE THIRD PARTY 



enough. If you’re interested, I can 
give you some background.” 

“Go ahead,” Roger said. “I’d 
like to find out what’s behind this.” 

“Well,” the historian began. “I 
guess that you could say that this 
story goes back 4000 years. The 
hatred between the Jews and the 
Arabs goes back that far, and it 
plays an important part in the pres- 
ent situation. Actually the seeds of 
the present trouble were planted 
more than a hundred years ago, 
when the United States helped the 
Jews set up a republic on land that 
the Arabs considered theirs. When 
the republic of Israel was estab- 
lished, many Arabs were driven 
from their homes. Added to this, 
American economic aid to Israel 
didn’t help our relations with the 
Arab world. As a result, the fifties 
and sixties of the last century were 
a time of unrest throughout the 
Middle East. 

“A short war between Israel and 
the Arab States lasted from 1946 
to 1949. The Arabs lost out, but 
border incidents occurred intermit- 
tently until 1969. After the United 
States and Russia were involved in 
the Two Week Chaos, the Arab 
League moved against Israel. The 
Arabs had grown in strength dur- 
ing the preceding twenty years and 
were able to push the Jews out of 
Palestine or put them under their 
control. 

“Under agreements made in the 
United Nations, the United States 
sent an expeditionary force to the 
Holy Land. The whole affair was 
a debacle. America had been weak- 
ened by the atom bombing of many 
of her cities and military establish- 
ments. Russia was also out of the 
running. After the death of Malen- 

75 




kov in 1968, one of the party lead- 
ers had tried to bring union by 
starting a war. After American re- 
taliation with hydrogen and atom 
bombs, the growing resentment of 
the Russian people against an un- 
desirable system exploded into 
open revolt. The Soviet Union be- 
came a disorganized crazy-quilt 
pattern of small, constantly war- 
ring states. 

“On top of the destruction of 
atomic war, came the great eco- 
nomic collapse of 1970. The finan- 
cial structure of the United States 
and her allies fell apart, and with 
it the United Nations went down 
into oblivion. The states of the 
Arab League could now do much 
as they pleased without outside in- 
terference. 

“The Two Week Chaos and the 
great collapse incapacitated the 
western powers for nearly thirty 
years. The Arab States prospered 
and formed the League of Islam in 
1990. The League covered the 
eastern end of the Mediterranean 
and the coast of North Africa. Dur- 
ing this period. South America had 
formed the South American Re- 
public and became a world power. 

“The North American Union, 
which was formed in 1997, wished 
to take up where the United States 
had left off in the development of 
Arabian oil. The Arabs, who had 
developed the fields themselves 
with help from South America, had 
no desire for North American in- 
tervention. The Americans, who 
had a long term lease signed in the 
late fifties, were not willing to give 
up so easily, and hard feeling de- 
veloped. The Suez incident of 
thirty years ago and the American 
control of the moon and the satel- 

76 



lite stations didn’t help matters 
any. 

“When the Americans finished 
the first satellite station in 1984 and 
landed the first rocket on the moon 
in 1991, the Arabs became appre- 
hensive and made known their wish 
to build a spaceport in the Sa- 
hara Desert. The North American 
Union, which had a monopoly on 
rocket building facilities, refused to 
allow it, out of fear of the growing 
strength of the Arabs. I think that 
that was a serious mistake. The 
sight of the satellites passing over- 
head, plus the knowledge that they 
belong to an unfriendly power 
doesn’t help to create good will. 
The fact that the moon has an in- 
dependent government makes it 
worse. The leaders of Islam know 
that the Lunar government 
wouldn’t allow nationalism in 
space. I guess you know how the 
Lunar citizens feel about the North 
American monopoly on space 
travel.” 

“They don’t like it,” Roger said. 
“They feel that they could be more 
independent if they were receiving 
supplies from more than one 
source. Lunar government is noth- 
ing more than a form, set up by 
the North American Union to keep 
up appearances. The moon isn’t 
self sufficient enough to make its 
independence more than a form. 
If the Lunar colonies could trade 
with more than one nation, they 
could maintain their independence 
by the moon’s natural defensive 
position; and control of the satel- 
lite stations would help to ease in- 
ternational tensions. There’s not 
much chance of a dictatorship be- 
ing formed there, because the col- 
onists are too individualistic and 

LEE B. HOLUM 





are interested in their government. 
It looks to me like both sides are at 
fault in this mess.” 

“That’s usually the case/’ the 
historian commented. “The Arabs 
aren’t free of blame either. Some 
of their tactics in the Holy Land 
weren’t exactly calculated to win 
the good will of the United States, 
and they have been rather violent 
in some of their dealings with our 
citizens.” 

The conversation was inter- 
rupted when one of their captors 
opened the door a few inches and 
slid two cans of food concentrate 
through the crack. 



“I see dinner has arrived,” 
Nolan said as he stepped over to 
the door and picked up the con- 
tainers. He handed one to Roger, 
and the two men removed the tops. 
In a few minutes a coil in the sides 
of each container heated the con- 
tents, and the prisoners ate a warm 
if uninspiring meal. Plastic spoons 
fastened to the sides of the cans 
served as utensils. 

After they had finished the food, 
the two prisoners sat and discussed 
various topics until late in the eve- 
ning, when they finally turned in. 

Outside, the temperature 
dropped to sixty degrees below 



THE THIRD PARTY

zero. The stars sparkled with a 
brilliance that was reminiscent of 
outer space. Once the frosty still- 
ness was broken by the whine of 
the jets of a cargo plane, hauling a 
train of ore gliders from the mines 
on an island farther north. In the 
front room of the center hut a 
guard sat, watching a number of 
television screens which showed the 
area around the camp bathed in 
infra red light. In front of the hut 
lay the convertiplane, a shining, 
bluish silver dart with its needle 
nose and swept back wings and 
tail. Near the cliffs back of the 
huts, Nolan’s small two seater lay 
with its channel wings folded into 
the fuselage. 

At six, Roger was awakened 
roughly by one of the guards. He 
was given a can of concentrates 
which he ate quickly, his eyes stray- 
ing now and then to the big ma- 
chine pistol held by one of his cap- 
tors. After Roger had eaten, he was 
ordered out to the plane and 
strapped into a seat, an armed 
guard beside him. With screaming 
jets blowing air over its channel 
wings, the convertiplane lifted from 
the snow and, a few minutes later, 
streaked into the dark sky under 
the power of its main jets. 

Three hours later they descended 
to the yard of a large house on the 
outskirts of Denver. The scattered 
buildings of the city lay on a blind- 
ing white blanket of snow that 
sparkled in the winter sun like 
minute jewels. Roger was hurried 
into the house and soon stood in 
the middle of a spacious living 
room, his hands held firmly by steel 
handcuffs. He faced a man with 
swarthy skin and dark hair, a typ- 
ical Latin type. 

78 



“Sehor Lorin,” the South Amer- 
ican said and motioned toward an 
easy chair. “Please be seated. Per- 
haps you are tired after your trip.” 
“The trip was all right,” Roger 
replied coldly, “though I don’t like 
traveling against my will. I trust 
that the Arabs are paying you well 
for this little job.” 

A momentary look of surprise 
crossed the man’s handsome fea- 
tures, but he smiled quickly and 
said in an affable voice tinged with 
surprise. “Arabs? What do they 
have to do with this? I do not know 
any Arabs. You do me an injustice 
to think that I would work for any 
other country than my own.” 

Hoping that the results would 
justify his confidence, Roger re- 
plied. “Quit trying to bluff. South 
Americans have no reason to kid- 
nap me. They’d have absolutely 
nothing to gain and plenty to lose 
by such actions. Even if they could 
fight a long drawn out war with us, 
they’d lose in the end. Why most 
of your scientists and engineers re- 
ceive their graduate schooling up 
here. I met quite a few of your 
countrymen during my school 
days.” 

“You are an astute man,” the 
South American smiled. “Yes, I am 
actually working for the League of 
Islam.” He admitted it blandly 
without apparent conscience or re- 
morse. 

“I can’t say that I admire a man 
who’d sell his country, and not only 
that but the whole western hemi- 
sphere down the river. Did they 
pay you thirty pieces of silver?” 
Roger asked scornfully. 

“The stakes are much higher 
than that,” the traitor replied, 
without apparently being affected 

LEE B. HOLUM 




by Roger’s scorn. “An empire 
awaits those who are bold, greater 
power and riches than any ruler 
has even known before.” 

“I thought that we had left that 
behind with the twentieth cen- 
tury.” 

“The desire for power is always 
with us,” the traitor, whose name 
was Manuel Juarez, said. “If I do 
not get it, someone else will. The 
struggle never ends.” 

“Maybe that’s true in some parts 
of the world,” Roger said, “but we 
don’t do things that way here.” 

“Be that as it may,” Juarez said 
with finality. “We won’t speak of 
it again.” Abruptly he turned his 
chair toward a blank wall and 
pressed a button on the arm of the 
chair. The whole wall lit up with 
stereo color, and the room re- 
sounded with the hum of a crowd 
of people. 

“Skiing is an interesting sport,” 
Juarez commented. “I enjoy 
watching the skill with which the 
skiers perform in these tourna- 
ments.” 

Roger and Juarez watched a 
symphony of graceful form and 
movement against a backdrop of 
snow, blue sky, and tall pines. Both 
men sat in chairs that moulded 
automatically to the shape of the 
body. Radiant heat bathed them in 
warmth that was a pleasant con- 
trast to the wintry scene in the tele- 
vision wall. 

The instrument which showed 
them the ski tournament so clearly 
represented a force that had killed 
an entire industry eighty years 
earlier. The economic collapse and 
the development of good color 
stereo television had resulted in the 
complete destruction of the movie 

THE THIRD PARTY 



industry. Although there was still 
much poor entertainment on the 
air, any person could usually find 
entertainment to suit his taste, 
whether it was for adventure 
stories or Shakespeare, for popular 
music or the works of the great 
composers. 

R oger was held in the house 
for about a week and a half. 
Although he did not know why he 
was held for such a long time, he 
knew that he was being watched 
with unceasing vigilance. He had 
no chance to escape. Then sudden- 
ly the enforced inactivity was over. 

Juarez and two guards entered 
his room. All three were dressed in 
outdoor clothing and were armed. 

“You will come with us peace- 
fully,” Juarez warned. “If you try 
anything foolish, we will not hesi- 
tate to kill you. We have other 
plans for you, but your death here 
would serve our purpose.” 

Roger went. They left the house 
and prepared to enter a small 
channel winged plane. The craft 
had a tear shaped body flanked by 
two pontoon-like cylinders. Each 
cylinder contained two small jet 
engines, one blowing a stream of 
air forward and the other blowing 
a stream backward across wing-like 
plates. The supersonic blasts gave 
the wings enough lift so that the 
plane could hover, rise vertically, 
or move forward or backward with 
equal ease. Such planes could at- 
tain a speed of 450 miles per hour. 

At this time, a small patrol plane 
of the same type was flying slowly 
through the area. Both of its oc- 
cupants were thoroughly bored, 
and one of them began to look 



79 




around through a pair of light am- 
plifying binoculars. He spotted the 
abduction scene taking place be- 
low. Every detail, including Roger’s 
handcuffs, was crystal clear. The 
patrolman, his curiosity aroused, 
switched to ultraviolet sensitivity, 
but saw none of the code numbers 
that appeared on the bodies of all 
police planes. Handcuffs and no 
police markings meant a check re- 
port to police headquarters. 

“Patrol 67,” the policeman re- 
ported into the radio. “There’s a 
prisoner being held in Zone 18. 
The plane has no police markings. 
The prisoner is about five feet, 
eleven inches tall, has light hair, a 
rather large nose, and is wearing a 
green jacket over gray coveralls. 
One of the other men is dark, 
short, and stocky.” 

“That sounds like Roger Lorin,” 
came the reply. “He disappeared 
from Arctic City about a week ago. 
There’s a bulletin out on him. 
Keep a long distance watch on that 
plane.” 

About an hour after they had 
taken off the fugitives, who were 
flying low, disappeared in the 
mountains and were lost to the 
police plane’s radar. 

The sun set, and night settled its 
cold hand over the mountains. The 
stars glittered like icy diamonds in 
the almost black firmament. The 
moon bathed the world in cold 
silvery light. The mountains rose 
like walls against the cold, dark 
sky. 

The plane climbed out of a can- 
yon and flew southwest along the 
side of a high peak. At treetop 
level, they flew through a high 
pass, and entered a valley where a 
small, ice-covered lake gleamed in 

80 



the cold moonlight. The plane 
landed on the glittering ice. Among 
the pines on the west side of the 
lake, stood a stately hunting lodge. 
The outside was faced with logs to 
give it a rustic look, but the interior 
was luxuriously furnished. 

Two men from the lodge pushed 
the plane into a hangar on the lake 
shore, while Roger and his captors 
climbed a short flight of stairs and 
entered the building. 

“Now we wait,” Juarez said dis- 
gustedly. “I hope that Gomez gets 
here soon, so that we can get this 
business over with and get out of 
here. I cannot be sure, but I 
thought I saw someone following 
us after we took off this morning.” 

But he didn’t get his wish. For 
the next three days, the men passed 
the time in various ways. Some 
went fishing through the ice on 
the lake, others watched television, 
still others played cards or pool in 
the game room. 

During this time the police were 
not idle. They staked out the house 
in Denver and waited. Their pa- 
tience was rewarded when, on the 
second night, a small plane came 
down out of the dark sky and hov- 
ered over the landing area. A man 
dropped to the ground and headed 
toward the house, and the plane 
rose into the night with blue flame 
dancing from the ends of the wing 
cylinders, and headed back toward 
the mountains. A large police plane 
high above traced the flight of the 
small ship with infra red detectors 
and spotted the hideout of the fugi- 
tives. 

On the third night Miguel Go- 
mez arrived. He was a big, strap- 
ping man unusually light com- 
plected for a South American. His 

LEE B. HOLUM 




greetings were loud and boisterous. 

*‘Well, Juarez,” he said loudly, “I 
see that you have our prisoner in 
good condition. But we can do 
nothing for awhile. A new plan has 
been developed. In one week, a 
rocket carrying high officials from 
our Republic will take off from the 
Chicago spaceport. These officials 
go to inspect the Lunar atomic 
laboratories. That rocket will crash, 
and the North Americans will be 
blamed. There will be evidence of 
general negligence with hints of 
sabotage. So! the fun will begin. If 
that does not work, we will use our 
friend, Lorin, here to top it off.” 

That night they listened to a late 
newscast before going to bed. The 
situation was tense. The presidents’ 
meeting had been postponed until 
after the inspection of the moon 
laboratories by the South Ameri- 
can officials. There was talk of a 
general mobilization and a tighten- 
ing of discipline at the military sta- 
tions along the Mexican border 
and the gulf coast 



F ive hundred miles above 
the Earth, the polar weather 
station wheeled silently through 
space. A sphere two hundred feet 
in diameter, it was girded by a 
ring deck that was home to forty 
men and women. The big observa- 
tion room was the real reason for 
the space station’s existence. Here, 
the weathermen kept watch over 
the movements of Earth’s atmos- 
phere. The fluffy white clouds that 
appeared on their screens told a 
t^e of mass air movements that 
meant stormy or clear weather for 
the Earth below. An almost blinding 
white mass of cloud over Canada 



told of a cold front moving south- 
ward to collide with warm air 
from the Gulf of Mexico and un- 
leash a blizzard over the plains of 
the Midwest. Tumbling clouds hid 
a storm that whipped the North 
Atlantic into a raging fury of white 
water. Clear areas showed where 
snow sparked under the winter sun 
or where soft tropical breezes 
ruffled the fronds of palm trees. 

The station was passing over the 
Pampas of Argentina on the day 
side of Earth when the incident 
occurred. Miriam Andrews, on 
duty at the time, sat watching the 
progress of a small rain squall. 
Suddenly a look of surprise crossed 
her rather plain features, and she 
turned the amplifier gain-knob of 
the light amplifying telescope to 
higher magnification. On the screen 
appeared a sprawling airport on 
which lay scores of large, box-like 
transport planes. Into the huge, 
channel winged craft flowed lines 
of robot controlled armored ve- 
hicles. Miriam, who had a keen 
mind and an interest in interna- 
tional affairs, recognized the dan- 
gerous possibilities of these prep- 
arations. She did not hesitate to call 
the station director. That individ- 
ual was summoned from a deep 
sleep by the imperative buzzing of 
the intercom. He switched the in- 
strument on, saw Miriam’s excited 
face, and came fully awake with a 
feeling of alarm. Excitement on the 
part of station personnel was apt 
to mean deadly danger. He inter- 
rupted the excited girl. “Repeat 
that again and slow down.” Mir- 
iam repeated her story. 

“I’ll send a message when we get 
close enough to Chicago to use a 
tight beam,” he said. “There’s no 

81 



THE THIRD PARTY 




use spreading that news all over the 
western hemisphere.” With that he 
broke the connection and called 
the radio room to give instructions 
about the message. 

The station swept around the 
Earth untroubled by the gather- 
ing fury below. A rocket, a slender, 
blue steel, winged cone, blasted 
away from the station with a brief 
but brilliant display of its atomic 
jets. The watches changed, and 
the weathermen continued to re- 
ceive data, analyze it, and send it 
to the coordinating centers on 
Earth. 

Although most of the men on the 
station heard the news with the 
detachment of those whose main 
interest lies in space and on the 
moon, the North American gov- 
ernment was not so calm. It was 
not long before big formations of 
box-like transports were headed 
southward with heavy loads of fly- 
ing armored equipment, techni- 
cians, and troops. Flights of dart 
like interceptors patrolled the gulf 
area, ranging the blue skies at su- 
personic speeds. On the ground, 
rows of slim antiaircraft missiles 
stood like candles in a birthday 
cake. At the first flicker on a radar 
screen, they would scream skyward 
to intercept hydrogen and atom 
armed 'missiles at the borderline of 
space. Both powers made good 
resolutions of nonaggression, but the 
rest of the world watched the pre- 
parations with a skeptical eye. The 
weapons that could unleash the 
horrors of nuclear warfare at the 
flick of a switch stood in frightening 
array on both sides of the gulf. 

Meanwhile, the police prepared 
to close in on the mountain cabin. 
Equipped with gas bombs, machine 

82 



pistols and recoiless rifles, they 
came struggling through a snow 
clogged pass and down the moun- 
tain sides from hovering planes. Un- 
seen in the darkness, they crept 
through the woods toward the 
house. A rifle shot cracked as a 
guard sighted them with his snip- 
erscope. One of the policemen fell, 
a bullet in his leg. The lights in the 
house went out, and gun flashes 
lanced through the windows. Bul- 
lets, hunting their prey like angry 
wasps, snarled through the dark- 
ness. 

Roger was locked in an upstairs 
bedroom with a guard before the 
door. During the next two hours, 
the roar of machine pistols and the 
crack of rifle fire split the mountain 
stillness and echoed from the hill- 
sides. At the end of that time, the 
police withdrew to rearrange iheir 
strategy. 

Juarez sat on the floor near a 
broken window and cleaned his 
machine pistol. ‘T think that it is 
time to kill Lorin and get out of 
here,” he said, as he placed a fresh 
clip in the magazine. “It will serve 
us to good advantage.” 

“Fool!” Gomez exclaimed. “If 
they found us with a dead man on 
our hands, we wouldn’t stand a 
chance. I have used this place 
enough to know that they have us 
pinned in. We can use Lorin as a 
bargaining point. We will arrange 
to take him with us and drop him 
by parachute. But — the parachute 
will not open. A convertiplane, 
which I have called, will meet us 
above the clouds and take us away 
before they can stop us.” 

“They will not trust our word,” 
Juarez said. “We cannot get away 
with it.” 



LEE B. HOLUM 




**Oh, but we can/’ Gomez izid. 
“The police know that Lorin’s 
death would have regrettable^ re- 
sults. Even the fact that he is a 
citizen of the North American 
Union would be enough to start 
trouble, let alone his position as a 
key research man on the neutron 
project. They will do anything to 
see that he remains alive. The 
scheme will further enrage the 
North Americans and might per- 
haps incite them to war.” 

“I see,” replied Juarez. “An ex- 
cellent plan. Let’s contact the po- 
lice, and see what happens.” 



U NSEEN by the guards around 
the house, four policemen 
crawled through the snow. Wear- 
ing white uniforms, they blended 
so well with their background that 
even the sniperscope men didn’t 
see them. Their view was limited 
by the fact that most of the large 
lights that had flooded the area 
with infra red radiation had been 
shattered by gunfire. Individual 
beams were insufficient to sweep 
the whole area. 

Carrying thirty-shot rocket 
launchers and rocket powered gas 
bombs, they took positions around 
the house and aimed the slender 
guns. At a radio signal, streams of 
red fire shot from the tubes, and 
the small rockets tore through 
every window in the house. In a 
few minutes, the place was satu- 
rated with sleep gas. Not a man 
moved throughout the building. 
Policemen in gas masks converged 
on the house. 

Roger awoke on a stretcher 
aboard a police plane. A police 
officer sitting beside the stretcher 



answered his dazed inquiries. 
“You’re on a police plane. We 
gassed the place where you were 
being held, and then moved in 
and took over.” He grinned. “You 
looked so peaceful that I didn’t 
have the heart to give you stimu- 
lants.” 

“How long has it been?” Roger 
asked worriedly. “I’d like to call 
my wife as soon as I can. She’s 
probably worried sick by now.” 

“It’s been close to three hours,” 
the officer replied. “We had to buck 
a snowstorm when we came out of 
that valley. We knew it was com- 
ing, but we thought that we could 
move in ahead of it and get you out 
before it struck. Unfortunately, 
they spotted us with those big in- 
fra red lights of theirs and threw 
our timing all out of kilter. We 
should be in Denver in less than 
half an hour.” 

Twenty minutes later the plane 
set down on the landing stage at the 
top of police headquarters. Roger 
was helped to his feet and led from 
the plane across the wind and snow 
lashed platform to an elevator. 

A few minutes later, he sat in the 
office of the Federal Police Com- 
missioner for the Rocky Mountain 
district. Roger asked permission to 
use the desk viewphone and quickly 
put through a call to Arctic City. 
In a few minutes, Linda’s face ap- 
peared on the screen. When she 
saw Roger her face lit up with joy. 
“Roger!” she exclaimed. “I’ve been 
so worried about you. I haven’t 
been able to sleep for days, won- 
dering what they might do to you.” 

“I’m all right, honey,” Roger re- 
assiured her. “I’ll be home in less 
than a day if the police don’t detain 
me here.”

^‘Better have her come to Chi- 
cago,” the commissioner inter- 
rupted. “You’ll have to stay there 
until we get this mess straightened 
out.” 

“I guess it would be better for 
you to come to Chicago. The police 
say that it’ll take a while to clear 
this business up. Maybe you’d bet- 
ter take a jet. It would be more 
comfortable for you.” 

“I’ll take the evening rocket,” 
Linda replied determinedly. 

“OK,” Roger said with a grin. 
“I’ll see you this evening then.” 

“Your wife seems anxious to see 
you,” the officer remarked drily. 
“Well, you may as well tell me 
about this business. I’ll send you 
on the rocket this afternoon so 
that you can meet your wife. We’re 
not sure just what was behind this 
kidnapping.” 

Roger narrated the events of the 
past two weeks explaining the part 
the Arabs were playing in the 
troubles between North and South 
America. 

“The Arabs, eh,” the officer 
mused. “I’m sending the prisoners 
to Chicago with you. I don’t think 
that it will be too hard to get a 
cerebral analysis writ. At least I’m 
going to recommend such action.” 

“Cerebral analysis?” Roger 
asked. “That must be something 
new.” 

“It is,” replied the officer. “This 
particular development of the en- 
cepholograph is so new that not 
many people know about it. The 
machine in Chicago is the only one 
in existence. We use truth drug 
writs to make it legal and still keep 
it secret. It isn’t exactly according 
to Hoyle, but we have to be careful 
these days. It takes an expert to 

84 



read the charts and, even then, 
only very clear thoughts can be 
picked up.” 

“It sounds like something out of 
science fiction,” Roger commented. 

“So did a lot of things we now 
take for granted,” replied the offi- 
cer. 

Late that afternoon, Roger sat 
aboard a rocket that screamed 
through the upper atmosphere on 
the last leg of its flight to Chicago. 
He watched through an eyeport as 
the ship lost altitude and circled 
the city, finally coming to rest with 
squealing tires on the concrete run- 
way. As soon as the locks were 
opened, Roger, accompanied by a 
police officer, left the ship and 
went through the boarding tunnel 
into the bustling terminal building. 
Roger’s eyes searched the crowd 
until they found Linda. He hur- 
ried toward her, and in a few min- 
utes they were in each other’s arms. 



A fter two days of quiet relax- 
ation, a plainclothes man took 
them to the tower of the Security 
Building which housed the Federal 
Police. The place was an electronic 
wonderland, with banks of instru- 
ments lining the walls. Gomez had 
been drugged and strapped into a 
large chair in the center of the 
room. His scalp was shaved, and 
several electrodes had been taped 
on. During the next hour and a 
half, the silence was broken only 
by the occasional click of a switch 
and the scratch of pens recording 
data. At the end of that time the 
electrodes were removed, and 
Gomez was carried from the room 
to sleep off the anesthesia. One after 
another, the prisoners went through 

LEE B. HOLUM 




the same process. Gradually the 
data added up and revealed the 
plan that was meant to plunge two 
nations into the horrors of atomic 
war. 

An officer gave quick orders. “I 
want all out going spaceships 
checked for sabotage. These men 
didn’t know the technical details. 
The least obvious thing to do 
would be to tamper with the fuel 
in such a way that it would explode 
violently when it was heated in the 
motors. The nitric acid used in the 
booster stage would make the best 
reactant. The rocket would be too 
close to the ground to drop the 
booster. Better check the fuel be- 
fore the rocket carrying those South 
American officials blasts off.” 

He turned to Roger. “Would you 
like to see how we stake out a 
place?” 

“Sure,” replied Roger. “Space- 
ports are always interesting.” 

They left the building and rode 
to the rocket field. Night had fallen 
and the spaceport lay stark and 
cold in the beams of large flood- 
lights. Three spaceships stood on 
the field, their bluish sides gleam- 
ing in the beams of the floodlights. 
To the south, a transcontinental 
rocket rose into the night like a 
spark from a chimney. The air was 
bitter with the temperature at 
eighteen below. 

“Take a look,” the police officer 
handed Roger a pair of binoculars. 
Roger placed the instrument to his 
eyes, and the side of the center 
rocket leaped toward him. He saw a 
man in the red overalls of a fuel 
technician climb the gantry along- 
side the center rocket and push 
something into a valve on the side 
of the booster stage, near its junc- 

THE THIRD PARTY 



ture with the main part of the ship. 

“Do you see that mechanic on 
the center rocket?” Roger asked. 

“Let’s see,” the officer replied 
and looked toward that rocket. 
“Yes, I see him now. A mechanic 
shouldn’t be pushing anything into 
that valve. That particular valve 
is used to jettison fuel in an emer- 
gency. A blast of compressed air 
will usually clear anything out of it. 
If that doesn’t work, the valve has 
to be taken apart to be cleaned. I’d 
like to know just what he shoved 
into that valve.” 

The officer spoke briefly into his 
pocket radio. Four policemen 
moved toward the entrances that 
led into the deep pit where the 
rocket stood. The technician closed 
the valve and climbed down the 
ladder. As soon as his feet touched 
the concrete floor of the pit, he was 
seized by the waiting policemen. A 
pistol shot cracked, and the pris- 
oner sagged to the floor with a hole 
in his chest. Instant confusion 
reigned in the pit, and in that 
confusion the assassin somehow es- 
caped. 

When the officer and Roger ar- 
rived, they found the policemen 
talking with a fuel technician. The 
technician left the group and 
climbed the ladder to the valve. 
He opened it and inserted a spring 
operated probe. 

“The valve’s clean,” he shouted 
down. “I’ll take off some of the 
nitric acid.” He did so, collecting 
the liquid in a small sample bottle 
which he carried on his belt. 
Climbing down the ladder, he 
handed the bottle to the officer in 
charge, who handed it to Roger. 
Roger unscrewed the cap and cau- 
tiously sniffed the contents. “I can’t 



85 




be sure, but if it’s what I think it is, 
you’d better not have the tanks 
drained until morning. Give it a 
chance to dissolve. Otherwise you’ll 
have some left in the tanks. It 
doesn’t react very rapidly at low 
temperatures.” 

“Just what do you think it is?” 
the officer asked. 

“Well,” Roger replied, “it’s 
probably some organic compound 
that would react with the nitric 
acid to form an explosive nitrate. 
Of course, it could be an ammo- 
nium compound that would react to 
form ammonium nitrate. That 
would do the job just as well.” 

T hree weeks later the agents 
were brought to trial for es- 
pionage and conspiracy to start a 
war. The whole story of the Arab 
plot came out. Following the lead 
of the North American Union, the 
South American Republic carried 
out an investigation of its own, 
and discovered the part the Arabs 
had played in various incidents on 
the southern continent. 

Later that summer, the Gibral- 
tar Conference met to settle griev- 
ances between the western powers 
and the League of Islam. King 
Ignatius II of the restored Spanish 
monarchy acted as a mediator. Re- 
luctantly the North American 
Union agreed to let the Arabs build 
a spaceport in the Sahara, thus 
giving them a chance to trade di- 
rectly with the Lunar colonies. On 
their part, the Arabs agreed to in- 
ternationalize the Suez Canal area, 
on condition of free passage across 
the isthmus for Arab traffic be- 
tween Egypt and Palestine. The 
Arabs refused flatly to allow a re- 

86 



establishment of the Republic of 
Israel, but would allow Jews to set- 
tle in the Holy Land under yearly 
quotas. Despite reluctance and bit- 
terness, a compromise was reached, 
and war was averted . for the 
moment. 

About a week after the trial 
Roger and Linda sat at a table in 
the large Spaceport Restaurant. 
Through the large window facing 
the rocket field, they could see 
clouds driven by an early March 
wind. Intermittent flurries of rain 
splashed against the glass. Roger 
happened to look up and see an 
elderly man approaching the table; 
his face lit up with recognition. 
“Well, Professor Nolan,” he said, 
offering his hand, “I’m glad to see 
you.” 

“I’m glad to see that you got out 
of that trouble all right,” Nolan 
replied as they shook hands. 

“This is my wife, Linda,” Roger 
said. “We’re just about to order 
lunch. Won’t you join us?” 

“It would be a pleasure,” replied 
Nolan as he sat down. “I’d like to 
hear about what happened to you.” 

Roger talked as he had punched 
their order into the robot server, 
and through most of the meal that 
arrived a few moments later. 

When he had finished his story 
Nolan asked him, “Do you intend 
to go back to Arctic City, now that 
this is over?” 

“No,” Roger answered, “The 
pile at Arctic City is nearly com- 
pleted. My part of the work is 
done anyway. I’ve been offered a 
job on the neutron rocket project 
at the Lunar laboratories, and Lin- 
da and I are leaving for the moon 
in about an hour. I enjoyed work- 
ing there before. The moon colo-

nists seem to have something that 
most earthmen lack . I ^ess 
you’d call it a pioneering spirit, a 
desire to explore. They are willing 
to accept new ideas. 

“But that’s enough about myself. 
I’ve been wondering how you got 
away.” 

“Simple enough,” Nolan replied. 
“The men who were left behind 
pulled out and left me at the camp 
when they heard about your rescue. 
They probably didn’t care to kill 
me if Aey didn’t have to. They left 
while I was asleep and probably 
went over the pole into Russia. 
They took my ship, but I was able 
to call for help with the radio. 
What happens to them doesn’t 
matter anyway. We’ll probably 
never hear of them again. 

“I suppose it won’t be long be- 
fore we have colonies on all the 
planets with that neutron rocket 
you mentioned.” 

“It’ll be a while yet,” Roger said. 
“There are a lot of problems in- 
volved in the development of a 
neutron rocket, and as long as we 
have to use a fuel processed by 
passing hydrogen through an elec- 
tric arc and into an expensive or- 
ganic compound at low tempera- 
tures, space travel will be too ex- 



pensive for anything more than the 
exploration expeditions that have 
been sent to Mars and Venus.” 

The voice of the announcer in- 
terrupted them. “The spaceship 
Goddard is loading passengers from 
tunnel eleven. All passengers must 
be aboard in twenty minutes.” 

Roger and Linda rose from the 
table. “That’s our ship,” Roger 
said. “We’d better get aboard. 
Goodbye, Professor Nolan. I hope 
we meet again.” 

“Goodbye, young fellow, and 
good luck.” Nolan gripped Roger’s 
hand. 

Thirty minutes later the profes- 
sor stood at the window and 
watched the preparations for blast 
off. The tail gantry crane moved 
away from the rocket, and a siren 
blared forth its warning. The 
booster motors were started, splash- 
ing green flame into the pit and 
shaking the ground with their roar. 
The tall ship rose slowly at first, 
and then more rapidly as it climbed 
a column of green flame into the 
clearing sky. It grew small and dis- 
appeared, A few minutes later the 
ship’s atomic drive came to life like 
a tiny new sun that was a beacon 
on the path to space. • • •

They lived by and for push 
buttons and machines^ and 
knew nothing else. But Endi- 
cott remembered about the 
old, old days — when a man 
could save a life without a 
push-button . • . 

BY G- K. HAWK 



S TIFF FINGERS of icy, wind- 
driven snow beat a tattoo on 
the hull of the cargo ship, filtered 
through the jagged tears in the 
metal skin, sifted down over the 
useless control board with its dead 
gauges and bank upon bank of 
pushbuttons. Amidship, a wind- 
thrashed branch screechingly 
scraped the reverberating hull, and 
the soimd, like the rasp of sliding 
hatch covers, echoed through the 
ship. 

Dazedly, Allison watched the 
sifting snow settle on the buttons, 
each one acquiring a grotesque, 
lop-sided, conical hat which grew 
as he stared. He reached forward 
an already stiffening finger and 
brushed one of the hats away, and 
almost idly watched another one 
form in its place. 

“Come on, Allison, come on. 
Snap out of it.” Endicott came out 
of the passageway into the control 
room, returned from his inspection 
of the machinery. “You hurt in the 
landing?” 

Allison didn’t answer. He shiv- 
ered and pushed another inquisi- 
tive finger at the control board; the 
finger selected a certain button and 
pushed it steadily. There was no 
click of a hidden relay, no whir of 
little motors springing to life. 

“You can punch that button or 
any of the others from now until — 
It won’t do any good. We’re dead.” 
The plume of Endicott’s frozen 
breath drifted over Allison’s shoul- 
der, merged with the sifting snow. 

“Dead?” Allison echoed in a 
sleepwalker’s voice. “Dead,” he re- 
peated and jabbed the button 
again and again. 

“In a manner of speaking,” En- 
dicott’s white-sandy brows drew 



88 




together in a frown. “We’re off the 
powercast — our receiver, I guess.” 
“No power.” Allison was follow- 
ing better, was waking up. “That 
means — Can’t you fix it, Chief?” 
“Nope. I tried, but something in 
its guts is burned out. No power.” 
Endicott beat his old blue-veined 
hands together. 

Allison’s frost-numbed fingers 
picked at the straps on his reclin- 
ing geeseat, and he stepped to the 
light metal deck. He severed and 



you always get what you want — 
except now!” 

“Now, now,” Endicott said 
soothingly. “Panic isn’t going to 
help us any. All we have to do is 
sit tight — and wait. They’ll send a 
relief ship out — ” 

“When?” 

“In the morning. Morning, sure.

forget. They’ll know exactly where 
to look.”

punched the button on the control 
board again. He was seized by a 
spasm of uncontrollable shaking. 
“No power means — no heat!” 
Panic crept into his voice. 

Endicott said nothing but looked 
at the tier upon tier of buttons, 
functionless now. 

Allison looked at the board, too, 
his narrow shoulders hunched. 
“They’ve never failed before,” he 
muttered through chattering teeth. 

“What?” Endicott seemed be- 
mused. 

“The buttons. Punch ’em, and 



in this white stuff.” 

“I tell you they know precisely 
where we are. And anyway the 
scanviewer will pick us up.” 

“I don’t think they’ll ever find 
us.” Allison slumped down on his 
transverse geeseat, stared wide- 
eyed at the drift forming slowly in- 
side the torn metal of the wind- 
ward side of the control room. 
“This white stuff scares me.” He 
shivered, then got up hastily, his 
boots slipping slightly on the snow- 
slick decking, and punched the 
button again. “It’s got to work!” 



89 




he cried and beat on the board 
with his fist. 

“Stop that!” Endicott said 
sharply. 

There was a crack of a slap in 
the control room, then silence. 

In a moment Endicott said in 
his soothing voice, “Sorry, Allison. 
Everything’ll be all right. Don’t you 
worry.” 

“If you say so, Chief.” Allison 
stood in the center of the control 
room, his arms slack by his sides. 

“We’ll be all right,” Endicott 
said. “We have fo^ capsules — ” 

“Sure, Chief.” 

“We’ll be all right, except — 
Endicott peered through the rents 
in the hull into the storm outside. 
“All we have to do is sit tight,” he 
added hastily. 

“We’ll freeze tonight without 
heat.” Allison’s voice was still 
breathless with panic. 

“Yeah. Yeah, I’ve been thinking 
about that. There’s some thing 
’way down deep in my mind — 
something I can’t quite get — ” 
Endicott still looked out at the 
storm-thrashed trees, a puzzled ex- 
pression wrinkling his face. “Some- 
thing from my childhood — I was 
born a long time before you, you 
know, before they set up state con- 
ditioning homes for children. Long 
before they set up this ‘everything- 
from-buttons’ business. Lived with 
my own people, 1 did, and I seem 
to remember — seem to remember 
— ” The puzzled expression became 
a frown of concentration. “Or may- 
be it was something I read a long 
time ago,” he mused. 

“Did what?” Allison perked up. 

“Read. You wouldn’t know what 
that was. Everything comes from 
buttons now, entertainment, food,

light, heat — everything . No, it 
was from my childhood, I’m sure. 
I remember my people used to take 
me out in the country — ” Endicott 
mused on while a cloak of snow 
grew on the shoulders of his jacket, 
and the light began to fade. 

“Out in the country? What for? 
Nobody goes out there.” Allison’s 
eyes gleamed slightly in the grow- 
ing dusk. 

“ — for picnics. And — ” Endicott’s 
eyes brightened, and one hand 
clenched. 

“For what?” Allison’s head thrust 
forward. 

“What?” Endicott snapped, ir- 
ritated at having his train of 
thought broken. 

“What did your people take you 
in the country for?” 

“A picnic . , Yes, yes, that’s it! 
I remember now!” Endicott’s words 
poured out. 

“You know it is forbidden to 
think of the old days.” 

“Shut up! Let me think. You 
want heat, don’t you?” 

“It’s forbidden to think of the 
old days,” Allison repeated stub- 
bornly. “You’ll get heat when I re- 
port this — in a different way.” 

“Shut up! Look, you want to 
keep from freezing tonight?” Endi- 
cott glared* “All right. Come with 
me and do as I say.” Without a 
backward glance Endicott crossed 
the slippery deck and entered the 
passageway. At the midship cargo 
hatch he stopped. 

“How are you going to open it 
without power?” Allison’s breath- 
plume shot over Endicott’s shoul- 
der. “It’s locked and unlocked by 
a button on the control board. Re- 
member Chief?” 

“Stop gloating, Allison. This is 

G. K. HAWK 




for your benefit as well as mine. 
There’s an escape hatch in the 
control room.” 

“That’s controlled by power, 
too.” 

“Yes, but in these older modek 
the hatch also has a manual con- 
trol, as I remember.” Endicott 
moved off toward the control room. 

Allison hesitated, then followed, 
and joined Endicott as he began to 
search the control board. Endicott 
found the emergency lever for the 
escape hatch and tugged on it, 
turning his head to watch the hatch 
in the side of the hull, back of his 
seat. The hatch, big enough for 
one man to pass through at a time, 
popped, crackling with frost, and 
stirred slightly. 

“Now, Allison, my boy, let’s put 
our shoulders to it.” Endicott was 
in high spirits again. 

As soon as the hatch swung open, 
Endicott put his head and shoul- 
ders through the opening, squint- 
ing his eyes against the icy snow 
which swirled past him. He grabbed 
a handhold on the outside of the 
hull and pulled his legs through, 
and dropped into the snow along- 
side the ship. 

Allison’s head and shoulders ap- 
peared in the opening, and in a 
moment he was beside Endicott. 
“Now what?” Allison yelled above 
the wind, 

Endicott looked toward the 
clearing in which they had landed, 
then turned to face the trees around 
the disabled ship. He waded 
through the snow to the nearest 
one and reflectively took hold of a 
dry branch over his head, tugged 
it several times as though judging 
its resiliency, before snapping it 
off. 



“Now, Allison, you see what I 
did? Well, you do the same, only 
gather ah armload of branches. 
When you have them, bring them 
to me at the ship. And keep on 
gathering them until I tell you to 
stop.” 

Allison stood still in the deep 
snow, peering suspiciously at En- 
dicott through the snow-swirl. “Is 
this something from the old — ?” 

“Never mind that now, Allison,” 
Endicott said patiently. “Let’s not 
worry about all that twaddle. You 
want to be warm, don’t you? So, 
just do as I say.” 

Allison’s eyebrows shot up and 
lowered instantly, and his face set 
in stubborn planes. “If this is from 
the old days I’m not sure I want 
any part of it.” He looked furtively 
over his shoulders at the gloomy 
woods. 

“There are no Conditioning 
Committees here, Allison,” En- 
dicott said testily. “Get on with 
it.” 

Allison took a few reluctant steps 
toward the nearest tree. Endicott 
started back to the ship with his 
branch, looking back over his 
shoulder. 

“No, no, Allison. See those green 
needles? It won’t do at all. Dry 
branches, Allison, dry branches.” 
The whipping wind carried Endi- 
cott’s words over the few yards. 

“I can’t see how these — 
branches? — are going to keep us 
warm. It seems like a lot of use- 
less trouble getting them,” Allison 
said sulkily, suspicion and fear 
unabated. 

Endicott didn’t answer. Instead, 
he went to the side of the ship 
away from the wind and began

valuable to the somewhat under- 
manned Flan jo base on Rhea. 

On the other hand, his concern 
for the others aboard the ship was 
so slight that he would not, on his 
own, have warned them of the 
impending acceleration, which 
could have injured or killed them. 

He made his move at 10 minutes 
before zero hour. As a paying pas- 
senger from Mars City to Titan, 
he had the run of the ship, and 
had been lounging in the control 
room for half an hour. Migl, the 
engineer, was on duty and was 
sorting the blast-pattern tapes, a 
job Qoqol had started during his 
shift. 

Albrekt simply took a heat gun 



from the rack, stuck it in Migl’s 
back and ordered him to leave the 
control room. Migl took it as a 
joke, at first. 

“It’s no joke,” Albrekt assured 
him, nudging him with the weap- 
on. “Get below, if you don’t want 
to get burned.” 

Puzzlement written all over his 
swarthy face, Migl unstrapped him- 
self from the captain’s chair and 
pushed himself across the room. 
Albrekt slid into the chair, buckled 
himself in and pulled two rolls of 
magnetic tape from the breast 
pocket of his coveralls. He found 
the roll marked “No. 1,” stuck the 
other in the rack beside him and 
inserted the end of his tape in the 



93 



automatic pilot. 

Migl paused at the top of the 
gangway. 

“You’re not going to blast?” de- 
manded Migl in amazement. 

“I am,” retorted Albrekt, hold- 
ing the heat gun steady. 

“Por Dios^ Carrel’s not strapped 
in!” exclaimed the engineer. 
“You’ll break every bone in his 
body if you don’t give him warn- 
ing!” 

Albrekt glanced at his watch. 

“You have five minutes to warn 
him and strap yourself in,” he said. 
“I can’t be bothered.” 

Migl vanished down the hatch 
and Albrekt flicked the switch that 
closed and locked it. A moment 
later the intercom system erupted 
with Migl’s frantic voice from be- 
low: 

“General alarm! Prepare for 
emergency acceleration ! General 
alarm! Hurry, Carrel!” 

Albrekt smiled grimly. 

The second hand swept around 
the face of the chronometer, 
boosting the reluctant minute hand 
forward in jerks. At exactly 1300 
hours, Albrekt pushed the firing 
button. 

The tape chattered through the 
automatic pilot. Apparently, the 
makers of the tape had planned 
on a fast-get-away: the pressure 
must have approached 5-G, pin- 
ning Albrekt painfully back against 
the cushioned reclining chair. 

He was able to move his eyes to 
watch the outside screens. The 
other eleven ships of the convoy, 
coasting in formation in their or- 
bit, dwindled behind them and 
swung gradually to one side. 

In a few moments, everything 
cut off, and weightlessness returned.

Red lights were flashing all over the 
control board, and distant alarm 
bells were clanging in the depths 
of the ship. Albrekt had no idea 
what they meant. He was no space- 
man. 

The radio loudspeaker crackled 
and blared. The convoy had dis- 
covered the By JovePs defection. 

"'Themis to flagship! Themis to 
flagship! By Jove! has changed 
course! Moving away fast. Position, 
RA 16-2^2, D minus 19-40.” 

After a moment: 

“Flagship to Themis: acknowl- 
edged. Flagship to By Jove! Flag- 
ship to By Jove! Carrel, what the 
hell?” 

Albrekt grinned. 

"Themis to flagship,” called the 
loudspeaker, when silence greeted 
the query. “Shall we follow?” 

“Flagship to Themis and all 
vessels. If you’re that flush with 
fuel, how about passing some 
around? No pursuit authorized. All 
vessels take readings on By JovePs 
new orbit as long as it’s in range. 
We’ll alert the patrol to investigate 
when we’re in radio range.” 

The ship’s intercom buzzed. 

“Albrekt!” It was the voice of 
Carrel, the captain. 

“Yes?” 

“We’ll get to the reason for this 
damn fool stunt later. Right now, 
do you plan any further acceler- 
ation?” 

“Later. I’ll warn you in time to 
strap down.” 

“I should hope so. Those G’s 
nearly killed Qoqol. This ship 
wasn’t built for that sort of ac- 
celeration, you idiot. Half the 
seams are sprung and leaking air.” 

“Repair them, then,” snapped 
Albrekt. “You’ll have time.” 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




During the long silence that en- 
sued, Albrekt sat back and took 
stock of the situation. So far, every- 
thing had worked perfectly. The 
other tape given him by the Flanjo 
agent on Mars was to be run 
through the automatic pilot exactly 
200 hours after the first one, when 
the By Jove^s diverging orbit car- 
ried it beyond range of the con- 
voy’s meager radar equipment. 

The control room would be his 
headquarters for the next few 
months, simply because the con- 
trol room was the only deck of the 
By Jove! which could be locked 
against the rest of the ship. All 
the weapons — the heat guns — were 
in the control room, so Albrekt ex- 
pected no trouble on that score. 

It was going to be a dull journey 
from here on out, and Albrekt de- 
cided he would do well to learn 
as much as he could about han- 
dling a space ship. He swung the 
chair around and ran his eyes along 
the shelves of Carrel’s microfilm li- 
brary. The title Sailing Space, by 
Dr. Russo Alin, caught his atten- 
tion. 

Albrekt inserted the spool in the 
projector and started it. An in- 
tense bearded face appeared on the 
screen, and the recorder said: 

“It is not generally known, ex- 
cept to students of technological 
history, that the steam powered and 
electric powered automobile gave 
the familiar gasoline powered 
automobile of the last century 
a close race for preference in 
early automotive history. The 
factors that caused the gasoline 
powered automobile to become 
predominant are not important 
here. What is important is that 
there were alternative methods of 



automotive propulsion . 

This didn’t start off well. Albrekt 
ran the spool up about half way 
and tried again. This time, the 
author was pointing to a well- 
chalked blackboard. 

“The radiation is so much 
stronger at Venus than farther 
out, that it is here we find most 
common use of the principle,” he 
said. “Using our formula, which, 
you remember, is F equals rA over 
2 plus gM, we . .” 

Disgusted, Albrekt switched it 
off and took out the spool. He found 
another. Survival for Spacemen, 
and tried it. It was a primer on 
conditions to be met in space travel, 
handled in popular vein. It was the 
sort of thing Albrekt wanted, and 
he settled back to listen to it. 

It was about nine hours before 
the last red light on the control 
board winked out and the clanging 
of the last alarm bell died out be- 
low. Then Carrel’s voice demanded 
an accounting over the intercom. 

“I’m in command of the ship 
now,” answered Albrekt, awak- 
ened from a light doze by the call. 
“I intend to remain so. As long as 
you and the others recognize that, 
you won’t be harmed.” 

There was a brief silence. 

“The only thing I can figure is 
that you’ve gone space happy,” 
said Carrel at last. “Albrekt, you’re 
no spaceman. You can’t have 
known what you were doing when 
you switched on the jets.” 

Albrekt did not answer. 

“Look ” said Carrell, “it’ll take 
several days to figure out what sort 
of orbit that blast threw us into, 
and I’m not sure we have anough 

fuel to correct it. You’d better let

“We may as well understand 
each other/’ said Albrekt. “I’m 
no spaceman, but some very good 
spacemen figured out that blast 
tape — and the other one I’m go- 
ing to use later. I’m a captain in 
the Flan jo military, and I’ve taken 
this ship and its cargo over, to 
deliver them to the Flan jo patrol. 
None of you will be hurt if you 
cause no trouble.” 

“So that’s it!” snorted Carrel. 
“Damned pirate high- j acker! My 
advice to you, Albrekt, is to come 
out of there and let me put you 
under arrest, because if you don’t 
we’ll be coming in after you.” 
“Try it, and I’ll bum you,” re- 
torted Albrekt. 



A fter sleeping several 

times, Albrekt was ready to 
concede it was not going to be as 
cozy in the control room as he had 
thought at first. It offered basic 
comforts of home, but the showers 
were on the larger navigation deck 
below. Several months without a 
bath promised to be uncomfortable. 
All decks carried plenty of emer- 
gency rations in case they were 
sealed off by a meteor collision, but 
the rations were not too tasty, Al- 
brekt’s mouth was beginning to 
water at the thought of the frozen 
meals stored two decks below, a- 
vailable to the crew. 

Most of Carrel’s book tapes were 
too technical to interest him, but 
he spent much of his time listen- 
ing to those which offered him in- 
formation in simple terms. The pat- 
tern of meaning of all the dials, 
switches and buttons crowded into 
the control room became a little 
clearer to him. 



Albrekt did not see how the crew, 
weaponless and locked below, 
could challenge his mastery of the 
ship. He detected the first effort in 
this direction about 80 hours after 
the By Jove! had left the convoy, 

Albrekt was eating a meal of 
emergency rations when he 
glimpsed movement on one of the 
rear screens. He turned his atten- 
tion to it at once. 

A spacesuited figure was emerg- 
ing from the airlock, which was in 
a narrow waist between the vessel’s 
personnel sphere and the huge 
cargo cylinder beneath it. From the 
suit, it was either Carrel or Migl. 

The figure moved cautiously up 
on the outside of the airlock, grip- 
ping its surface with heavy mag- 
netic shoes. In the hooks of the 
spacesuit, it carried two sledge 
hammers. 

Albrekt flipped on the switch 
to the intercom, which was tuned 
to the spacesuit helmet radios as 
well as the ship’s system. 

“I’d advise the man in the space- 
suit to forget it, and get back 
aboard,” he said gently. “If he 
doesn’t, I’ll sweep the outside sur- 
face with machine gun fire in ex- 
actly two minutes.” 

His fingers hovered over the fir- 
ing buttons of the heavy weapons 
the By Jove! carried for defense 
against possible marauders. But in 
a moment the spacesuited figure 
reentered the airlock. 

“It would take you some time to 
break into the control room with 
a sledge hammer,” Albrekt said 
conversationally into the micro- 
phone. “At the first blow. I’ll blast 
anyone who tries it. That’s fair 
warning.” 

It was several days later that 
CHARLES L. FONTENAY 



96 




Albrekt began to feel sleepy long 
before his sleeping time. The real- 
ization hit him suddenly that for 
some time he had been yawning and 
stretching, relaxing more and more 
in the chair, his eyelids getting 
heavier and heavier. His head was 
beginning to ache a little. He slept 
by the clock and awoke by the 
clock. He should not be sleepy for 
hours yet. 

Rousing himself with an effort, 
he swung bleary eyes around the 
control room, anxiously. He could 
see nothing out of order. But how 
would one detect something that 
made one abnormally sleepy? What 
could it be? 

Illness? 

If there were harmful bacteria 
aboard the ship, they should have 
struck many days ago. There was 
no disease in space itself. 

Gas? 

If such ships as the By Jove! 
carried any sort of gas, Albrekt 
didn’t know about it. He had been 
briefed on the weapons he might 
face. Surely gas would have been 
mentioned. 

Perhaps it was chance, or perhaps 
some part of his mind was swiftly 
scanning what he had learned 
through his reading of the last few 
days: his eyes fell on a bank of 
dials ranged side by side on the 
control board. The hands of all of 
them were lined up at the same 
angle — all but one. It had sunk far 
to the left. 

The legend above the bank of 
dials read: “OXYGEN.” The 

plate below the lagging dial read: 
“Control Room.” 

Albrekt unstrapped himself from 
the chair with nervously fumbling 
hands. Somehow the crew of the 



By Jove! was interfering with his 
oxygen supply. 

Albrekt was beginning to feel a 
little nauseated. His head throbbed. 
He pushed himself across the con- 
trol room and grabbed the helmet 
of the spacesuit that himg there. 
He did not take time to put on the 
suit itself, but pulled the helmet 
down over his head and switched 
on the suit’s oxygen supply. 

In a moment his head cleared, 
leaving only a slight headache. 

As well as Albrekt remembered 
from the reading tapes, the ship’s 
oxygen supply was on one of the 
lowest decks. The crew evidently 
had blocked the line to the con- 
trol room. 

“You’d think there’d be some 
alarm system for that sort of thing,” 
he muttered to himself. But then, 
of course, the hull had not been 
pimctured. The dials were sup- 
posed to be checked frequently. 

The question that faced Albrekt 
now was how to get out of this trap. 
He couldn’t live in the spacesuit 
indefinitely. His hand brushed the 
heat gun at his side. 

Filling his lungs with deep gulps, 
he ducked from beneath the hel- 
met and returned to the control 
board. He unlocked and opened 
the hatch to the navigation deck 
below. There was an upward swirl 
of air, and Albrekt permitted him- 
self to breathe again. 

A head poked itself cautiously 
up the companionway. Carrel. The 
captain’s face was a strong one, 
lined with years of decision, gold- 
en-brown with the tan that one 
gets only from years in the thin 
air of Mars. Carrel’s dark hair was 
beginning to gray, but his electric 
blue eyes were still young. 



BLOW THE MAN DOWN 



97 




He stopped when he saw Al- 
brekt at the control board. Albrekt 
held the heat gun on the captain 
steadily. 

“I’m not anywhere near over- 
come/’ said Albrekt. “You’d better 
turn around and go back down.” 

Carrel did. 

As long as the hatch stayed open, 
oxygen could not be cut off from 
the control room. Albrekt decided 
he could afford to leave it open, 
since he had possession of the 
weapons. He would have to lock it 
while asleep, of course. But, even 
with the oxygen supply cut off, the 
control room should contain enough 
to carry him for eight hours. If 
not, he could set an alarm to 
wake him every four hours, or 
even every two hours, to open the 
hatch and refresh his air. 

The fact that he could leave the 
hatch open safely gave him another 
idea. He was hungry for some food 
besides the dry emergency rations. 

Albrekt checked the chrono- 
meter. Within the next two hours, 
he was scheduled to run the other 
blast tape. He would have time. 

Heat gun in hand, he moved 
quietly to the hatch. The compan- 
ionway was clear. From below 
came the murmur of voices. He 
moved cautiously a few steps down 
the metal ladder until he could 
see beneath the ceiling of the 
navigation deck. 

Migl was taking a shower on 
the other side of the room, while 
Carrel and Qoqol relaxed in con- 
tour chairs beside the dead-reckon- 
ing tracer. 

“What is Flanjo, Carrel?” asked 
the booming voice of Qoqol, the 
navigator. 

Qoqol was a Martian. His round 

98 



body with its huge oxygen storage 
hump was not quite as big as a 
human body, but his thin arms and 
legs, each equipped with half a 
dozen double joints, were longer 
than a tall man’s height. They 
were wrapped around him now, 
out of the way, and his big-eyed, 
big-eared head peered through 
them like an urchin’s face through 
a tangle of vines. 

“The Flanjos are members of a 
fanatic sect who believe in human 
supremacy,” answered Carrel so- 
berly. “More than that, they be- 
lieve in their own supremacy over 
other humans. They revolted 
against the Solar Council and have 
a hidden base our forces haven’t 
been able to locate yet.” 

“They are loco, Qoqol,” said 
Migl from the shower. “Crazy. 
They’d make all you Martians 
slaves. Us too, probably.” 

“Why they want this ship?” asked 
Qoqol. 

“For the ship itself, partly,” said 
Carrel. “But our cargo’s pretty 
strategic, too. It’s mostly lithium, 
which they can use in nuclear 
weapons and power plants. They 
can use the plastics, tools and ma- 
chinery we’re carrying to improve 
conditions at their base. The gen- 
eral opinion I’ve heard is that their 
objective is to take over the Mars 
colonies. They need fusion weapons 
for that, but it’s hard to get light 
elements on the outer moons, 
where their base is thought to be. 
Whatever they have already, 100 
tons of lithium will help them 
immensely.” 

“Immensely,” assented Albrekt, 
stepping off the ladder to drift to 
the floor. He held the heat gun 
lightly in his hand. “I’m afraid I’m 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




going to require all of you to go 
ahead of me down to the storage 
deck and remain there while I en- 
joy a good lunch.” 

Silently they complied. The liv- 
ing quarters, where the food was, 
were one deck down, the storage 
deck below it. 

Albrekt ate his meal, keeping a 
watchful eye on the opening be- 
tween the living quarters and the 
storage deck. Then he returned 
to the control room, locked the 
hatch and strapped himself down 
for blasting. 

He kept his promise to Carrel 
and broadcast a warning of the 
blast over the intercom system. At 
the appointed moment, he ran the 
blast tape through the automatic 
pilot. 

The acceleration was not as 
heavy this time. The ship, safe 
from the prying of the convoy’s 
radar, swung slowly from its 
course and into a new prearranged 
orbit, on which a Flanjo vessel was 
to intercept it in approximately 
six months. 



S PACE is a lonely place — lone- 
lier than any place on Earth, 
lonelier than any place on Mars. 
No expanse of desert or ocean is so 
empty as space, for there one at 
least has something material be- 
neath him and around him. 

“An experienced spaceman 
would rather be burned than left 
alone in space,” said Carrel. “It’ll 
drive most men completely crazy 
in a pretty short time. I think 
you’ve realized that by now, Al- 
brekt. That’s why you won’t kill 
us.” 

Albrekt was eating a meal at the 
BLOW THE MAN DOWN 



table in the living quarters, his 
heat gun lying beside his hand. 
The others were seated on bunks 
across the room. Since the^ only 
necessity was to protect himself 
and keep the others out of the con- 
trol room, he had discontinued the 
practice of making the crew go 
below while he ate. Despite the 
atmosphere of enmity, the conver- 
sation and companionship filled a 
need he was beginning to recognize 
more keenly. 

“That’s true,” answered Albrekt 
agreeably. “For that and other 
reasons, I won’t kill you unless I’m 
forced to.” 

“But there’s nothing to prevent 
our killing you and retaking the 
ship,” reminded Carrel. 

“Nothing but this.” Albrekt laid 
his hand on his heat gun. 

“As a matter of fact, I don’t 
want to kill you, Albrekt,” said 
Carrel. “I want to capture you 
alive, and take you back to Mars. 
I imagine you have some infor- 
mation about Flanjo plans that 
would be pretty valuable to the 
council.” 

Albrekt laughed. 

“I admire your courage, Carrel,” 
he said. “But I’ve been in danger- 
ous positions before, for longer 
periods than this. I don’t intend to 
let my guard down.” 

Carrel apparently was blessed 
with iron self-control and Qoqol, 
like all Martians, habitually showed 
emotion in ways no Earthman 
could interpret. But Albrekt’s prac- 
ticed eye detected Migl’s restless- 
ness. When the crew’s move came, 
two^ days later, Albrekt was ready 
for it. 

As he had anticipated, it hap- 
pened at mealtime. Albrekt was be- 

99 




ginning to spend more time outside 
the control room, always keeping 
the others from getting between 
him and the hatch to higher decks, 
but mealtime was the logical time 
for his guard to be lax. 

At some signal Albrekt failed to 
catch, Carrel and Qoqol launched 
themselves directly at him from op- 
posite sides of the round room. 
Simultaneously, Migl drove through 
the air for the hatch to the upper 
decks. 

Albrekt’s muscles reacted like 
steel springs. Scooping up the heat 
gun, he dove across the table and 
twisted in the air as he floated 
swiftly between Carrel and Qoqol. 
Ignoring them for the moment, he 
trained the gun on the hatch to the 
navigation deck above and pressed 
the trigger. Migl had to grab the 
ladder frantically to keep from 
drifting head-on into the sizzling 
beam that barred his way. 

Albrekt anchored himself to a 
bunk and waved the heat beam in 
an arc above their heads. The 
metal ceiling smoked faintly. 

‘T won’t kill you all unless I 
have to,” he said calmly. ‘T can get 
along easily without one or two of 
you, though. Before you try any- 
thing like this again. I’d suggest 
you think seriously about which of 
you wants to die first.” 

Silence answered him. Migl still 
clung to the companionway ladder, 
about halfway up. Carrel clasped 
his knees in a sitting position about 
six inches off the floor near the 
round table in the center of the 
room. Qoqol, unable to stand up- 
right anywhere aboard the ship, 
crouched like a spider against the 
farther wall. 

Albrekt switched off the heat 
100 



beam and motioned at Migl with 
the gun. Watching them closely, 
Albrekt moved to the companion- 
way and pushed himself up through 
the hatch. 

Locking himself in the control 
room, he devoted himself to seri- 
ous thought for a while. Despite 
his warning, this sort of thing was 
likely to happen often. Eventually 
it must succeed, if only by the law 
of averages. 

The trouble was, Albrekt was ac- 
tually at a slight disadvantage. He 
knew by now that the absolute need 
for companionship in space was 
not idle talk. He had no intention 
of coasting alone, in a silent ship, 
for five and a half more months, 
and being shot as hopelessly insane 
when his Flanjo colleagues picked 
him up at the rendezvous. 

One solution, of course, was to 
kill two of the crew members. Then 
neither of the two men left could 
afford to kill the other. For sev- 
eral reasons, Albrekt preferred to 
find another solution. He had 
heard rumors that personality con- 
flicts between two people cooped 
up together in a spaceship drove 
them eventually at each other’s 
throats. Another factor was that, 
as long as there were three of the 
others, Albrekt could hold the 
threat of killing one or two of them 
over them. Besides, their technical 
knowledge would be valuable to 
the Flan j os, and Albrekt wanted to 
face no disciplinary action for de- 
stroying any of them unnecessarily. 

What was the substance of their 
threat to him, then? He examined 
it. Their threat was that they might 
reach the control room. He could 
not lock it from the outside, and 
he must come outside for good 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




food and necessary companionship, 
so that line of reasoning got him 
nowhere. 

But what was behind the threat 
of their reaching the control room? 
They might (a) obtain weapons 
to match his own; (b) communi- 
cate the ship’s position to warships 
of the Solar Council; (c) swing the 
ship off its prearranged course and 
avoid the rendezvous with the 
Flanjo vessel. 

Solution? Albrekt laughed short- 
ly. There was a solution to all three 
problems. 

With his heat gun, he reduced 
the radio transmitter to a molten 
mess. Now the By Jove! could still 
receive, but not send. 

Piling all the heat guns in the 
center of the room, he gave them 
the same treatment. The beam left 
them almost unrecognizeable in the 
midst of a shallow crater. He had 
come very near burning a hole 
through into the navigation deck. 

The last step was the most daring 
of all. It meant that he must trust 
absolutely to the accuracy of the 
two blast tapes he had run through 
the automatic pilot. He threw the 
switches that jettisoned the fuel 
tanks. 

In the screens, he watched the 
spheres of hydrazine and nitric 
acid, hurled from the ship by 
spring action, go drifting slowly 
away into the void. In effect, the 
By Jove! was now a voiceless dere- 
lict. 

Albrekt went below. 

‘‘This means that I intend to 
stand for no more foolishness,” he 
said harshly when he had told the 
others what he had done. “If you 
prefer, you may draw lots to de- 
cide which two I shall kill and 



which one shall have the pleasure 
of my company for the rest of die 
trip. The continued existence of all 
three of you will depend strictly on 
your good behavior.” 

Migl, lolling on a bunk, curled 
a sardonic lip at him. 

“You seem to have gone to a 
great deal of unnecessary trouble, 
ladron/* he said. “It is still worth 
the risk of at least one of our lives 
to destroy or capture you.” 

“You’re wrong, Migl,” said Car- 
rel soberly. “Now we have no fuel, 
we have no radio. The ship is in 
orbit, and we’re helpless to change 
it. No matter what we do aboard, 
the Flanjo ship will intercept us. 
The Flanjos will destroy us then 
if they don’t find Albrekt alive and 
safe.” 

“An accurate analysis,” agreed 
Albrekt briskly. “You’re showing 
good sense now, Carrel.” 

Carrel shrugged and spread his 
hands. Albrekt felt a little sorry for 
him in defeat. He admired Carrel’s 
bravery and resourcefulness. 

Albrekt’s sleep that night was 
more carefree than it had been 
since the By Jove! pulled free from 
its satellite orbit around Mars. 
There was still danger, of course. 
He had to be on the alert for a 
desperate attempt to disarm him, 
or an effort to overcome him in the 
control room by tampering with 
the ship’s machinery, despite Car- 
rel’s surrender. But it was less like- 
ly now. 

R elations were on a much 
more cordial basis from then 
on. Their conversation returned, 
almost, to the friendly terms of the 
earlier portion of the trip. 



BLOW THE MAN DOWN 



101 




“Ever been to the outer planets 
before, Albrekt?” Carrel asked cas- 
ually one day, munching a beef 
sandwich. 

“I spent ten years at the base, 
before they sent me back to work 
on Mars and Earth,” Albrekt re- 
plied. “I was born on Earth. My 
father took me out to the base 
when I was a boy.” 

“The base?” repeated Carrel, 
even more casually. 

“On Rhea,” said Albrekt delib- 
erately. His faint smile recognized 
the attempt to elicit information. 
“Now, figure some way to tell them 
back on Mars!” 

He thought Carrel flushed slight- 
ly, but could not be sure. 

“Ever been to Venus?” asked 
Carrel. 

“Never that far in, I’m afraid,” 
answered Albrekt. 

“I don’t suppose you passed 
quite this close to Jupiter on your 
other trips?” said Carrel. 

“How should I know?” de- 
manded Albrekt. “I’m no space- 
man. I don’t know how close to 
Jupiter we’re going now. I don’t 
remember anything said about 
Jupiter on my trips.” 

“They’d have opened the ports 
and let all of you see, if you were 
going within several million miles 
of it,” said Carrel. “Qoqol’s figured 
it out. We’re going pretty close this 
time.” 

“You want me to open the ports 
and let you see Jupiter?” asked 
Albrekt sarcastically. 

“Something more serious than 
that,” answered Carrel gravely. 
“It’s the radiation.” 

Albrekt pushed himself back 
from the table and stared quizzical- 
ly at Carrel. 

102 



“You wouldn’t take advantage 
of my ignorance to rib me a little, 
would you now, Carrel?” he chided 
gently. “I studied elementary as- 
tronomy, you know.” 

“You’re proving right now that 
you didn’t study astrogation,” re- 
torted Carrel sharply. “Any space- 
man can tell you the reaction of 
cosmic rays on Jupiter’s atmosphere 
is fatal at the distance we’ll pass in 
this orbit. If our convoy had been 
passing so close, every ship would 
have been shielded.” 

“Carrel, I can’t see your object 
in lying, but I think you are. Some 
damned good spacemen plotted 
this orbit.” 

“And what do they care about 
your life or ours?” demanded Car- 
rel hotly. “You know your Flanjo 
buddies as well as I do. We’ll live 
long enough for them to get all 
the information they want out of 
us.” 

Albrekt studied him closely. Car- 
rel returned his gaze with serious 
eyes. 

“Maybe you’re telling the truth,” 
said Albrekt slowly. “If you’re ly- 
ing, I can’t see your reason. You 
know I won’t panic, and we can’t 
change orbit.” 

“I’m trying to impress you with 
the seriousness of tiiis thing, be- 
cause there’s something we can do 
about it if you’ll let us,” said Car- 
rel patiently. “All it takes is a thin 
metal shield at a proper distance 
from the ship, and we can build 
that out of the cargo we’re carry- 
mg. 

“The only metal aboard is 
lithium,” demurred Albrekt stern- 
ly. “That lithium’s slated for nu- 
clear reactors and weapons and it’s 
going to reach Rhea intact!” 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




“We’re not going to bum up 
any of your precious lithium!” ex- 
ploded Garrel. “All I ask is to use 
half of it to build a shield. They 
can use the damn stuff out of the 
shield as easy as out of cargo bars. 
It’ll all be there, just the same.” 
Albrekt hesitated. It was quite 
conceivable that his superiors had 
not bothered about such a trifle as 
his slow death from radiation. They 
would have plotted the most effec- 
tive orbit for their purposes, and if 
the By Jove! didn’t happen to be 
shielded — well, casualties had to be 
expected in any military operation. 

“You have my permission to 
build the shield,” he said stiffly at 
last, “under my strict supervision, 
of course.” 

“That’s all right with me,” con- 
sented Carrel with a sigh of relief. 
“And I give you my word as a 
space captain, Albrekt, nobody 
aboard the By Jove! will lift a hand 
against you while it’s being built.” 
Despite Carrel’s reassurance, Al- 
brekt, wary of some stratagem, held 
to his determination to oversee 
every step of the shield construc- 
tion, with gun handy. 

Fifty tons of such a light metal 
as lithium is a pretty large volume 
of the stuff. Albrekt assumed that 
Carrel’s shield was to be a square 
or disc of the metal, rather thick 
to absorb the radiation, which 
would be interposed between the 
By Jove! and Jupiter. When work 
began, after several days of plan- 
ning, it became apparent that the 
construction task was something 
more than cutting out and fasten- 
ing together chunks of lithium. 

Instead of working inside the 
ship, the crew moved a furnace to 
the outside of the cargo hull and 

BLOW THE AAAN DOWN 



anchored it down. The Earthmen 
wore spacesuits, of course, but 
Qoqol did not, as Martians do not 
breathe, but extract oxygen from 
solid matter and store enough of it 
to last several hours at a time. 

To Albrekt’s surprise, they next 
hauled out some of the big pack- 
ages which were plastic domes for 
use on Titan. At extra-terrestrial 
bases, these hemispherical domes 
were inflated to form huge air bub- 
bles in which humans could live. 

“Plastic?” said Albrekt through 
his helmet radio. “I thought you 
were going to use lithium.” 

“We are,” replied Carrel’s voice. 
“We’ll fasten some of these domes 
together to form an airtight sphere, 
then inflate it from the oxygen sup- 
ply. It won’t take much pressure, 
and we can recover the oxygen 
later with the ship’s compressor. 

“Before we recover the oxygen, 
we’ll charge the plastic sphere elec- 
trically, so it’ll stay rigid. Then 
we’ll vaporize the lithium in the 
boiler and spray it over half the 
plastic sphere. We’ll blacken the 
plastic and melt it with solar heat, 
returning it to the boiler by charg- 
ing the boiler. I’m afraid we’re go- 
ing to ruin a few of the plastic 
domes, but that’s not important 
now.” 

“Spray the lithium? Fifty tons 
of it?” 

“Wait and see,” Carrel said. 
“This will be a bigger shield than 
you expected.” 

Later, at mealtime, Carrel 
brought a worry to the surface of 
Albrekt’s mind which the Flanjo 
agent had been trying to keep sup- 
pressed. 

“That was a pretty rash busi- 
ness, jetting all the fuel,” said Car- 

103 




rel. “What do we do if we^re off 
orbit?” 

“It seems to me IVe mentioned 
before that some very good space- 
men plotted this orbit,” replied 
Albrekt. 

“The best orbits sometimes re- 
quire minor corrections, when 
they’re this long,” said Carrel. 

“I couldn’t make them, anyhow, 
and I certainly wouldn’t trust any 
of you at the controls,” said Al- 
brekt. “Don’t you think my superi- 
ors thought of that when they 
planned this?” 

“Maybe,” said Carrel. 

Albrekt was amazed at the size 
of the shield Carrel was building. 
The inflated plastic sphere was big- 
ger than a small asteroid, some six 
to eight miles in diameter. Carrel 
had spliced together several of the 
biggest plastic domes available. 
Nowhere but in free space, could 
the sphere have been inflated with 
so little gas pressure. 

The ship could have floated 
around in Carrel’s sphere like a 
cork in a water bucket. 

“It has to be big, because the 
shield is going to be about 20 miles 
away from the ship, attached to it 
by lithium wires,” explained Car- 
rel. “So the diameter of the shield 
has to be this big, to eclipse the disc 
of Jupiter at the distance we’ll pass 
the planet.” 

“I don’t understand the princi- 
ple of this at all,” said Albrekt ir- 
ritably. “It seems to me a smaller, 
heavier shield closer to the ship 
would be just as effective.” 

“That’s because you don’t un- 
derstand this type of radiation,” re- 
plied Carrel. 

When the shield was completed 
and the plastic framework re- 

104 



moved, it was a tissue-thin metal 
hemisphere, attached to the ship 
like a parachute. Migl used up 
several oxygen cylinders as make- 
shift rockets to push the shield 
out to the proper distance from 
the ship, while the attaching wires 
were unreeled from the cargo 
winches. 

“We leave the wires on the 
winches, because we’ll have to shift 
the position of the shield from time 
to time by shortening some wires 
and lengthening others,” Carrel 
said. 

When the task was complete and 
the shield glimmered in the sun- 
light like a nearby moon, they all 
returned to the living quarters. 

“Qoqol, you’ll be in charge of 
keeping the shield at the proper 
angle,” said Carrel. “And, Albrekt, 
the truce is over.” 

“What do you mean by that?” 
growled Albrekt, his hand drop- 
ping to his heat gun. 

“I’ve kept my promise while the 
shield was being built,” answered 
Carrel. “Now, if we can catch you 
off guard, and do it without being 
burned down, I warn you we’re go- 
ing to try to disarm and capture 
you.” 

Albrekt relaxed. 

‘'You won’t get the chance,” he 
promised. “If you did, what good 
would it do you? We rendezvous 
with my ship in less than four 
months now.” 



D espite Carrel’s threat, Al- 
brekt was still in control of the 
situation when the hour of ren- 
dezvous approached. The necessity 
for keeping alert against possible 
attack was a considerable strain on 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




him, but he had been under strain 
many times before in his life. Nei- 
ther Carrel nor either of the others 
had made any overt move. 

Assured in his own mind that the 
risk became less and less as the 
trysting place neared, Albrekt had 
permitted the crew into the control 
room except when he slept above 
a locked hatch. Half an hour be- 
fore the scheduled time of meeting 
with the Flanjo ship, Carrel, Migl 
and Qoqol filed up through the 
hatch. Albrekt offered no objec- 
tion, and they floated across the 
control room to seats. 

“Looks like your ship would be 
on the screens by now, doesn’t it, 
Albrekt?” suggested Carrel quietly. 

“They don’t have to make the 
rendezvous exactly on time,” re- 
plied Albrekt, a little uneasily. 
“They know the orbit. They can 
pick us up anywhere along it.” 

“We’re not in the orbit,” said 
Carrel flatly. 

Albrekt scowled at him, but his 
eyes were drawn back irresistibly 
to the screens, empty except for the 
silvery lithium shield and, perched 
just above its edge, the small but 
baleful disc of Jupiter, 

“Qoqol checked the blast tapes 
you used, and we’re not in the orbit 
they’re suppose to put us in,” in- 
sisted Carrel. “Qoqol’s been mak- 
ing sightings for the last six weeks. 
Jupiter’s pulled us off orbit, Al- 
brekt.” 

“Is true,” boomed Qoqol. “We 
long way off.” 

“This sort of thing’s doing you 
no good,” snapped Albrekt. “I’m 
not a spaceman and I can’t check 
your figures, but I don’t think we’re 
off orbit.” 

“And if your ship doesn’t make 
BLOW THE AAAN DOWN 



the rendezvous?” asked Carrel. 

“If it doesn’t now, it will later 
on. And, by Saturn, we’re going to 
sit tight in this kettle till it does, 
Carrel! Last minute propaganda 
won’t work.” 

There was silence for a few min- 
utes, as the chronometer hand 
ticked on toward the hour of meet- 
ing. ^ 

The radio buzzed. Leaning for- 
ward, Albrekt turned up the vol- 
ume, eagerly. 

“Captain Albrekt Vebrug,” 
called the radio. “Flanjo patrol 
ship Bavaria to Captain Albrekt 
Vebrug.” 

Albrekt turned a triumphant 
face to Carrel. But Carrel gestured 
at the screens. They were still 
empty. And the radio voice was 
not coming in strongly. 

“Vebrug, we don’t find the By 
Jove! on our screens,” said the ra- 
dio, fading a little, then getting 
louder. “If you get this call, 
Vebrug, break radio silence and re- 
ply. Do you hear this, Vebrug? 
Break radio silence and reply!” 

Perspiration broke out on Al- 
brekt’s forehead. He could not re- 
ply. The ship’s transmitter was a 
pile of junk. 

“Vebrug, Vebrug,” intoned the 
radio insistently. “We don’t find 
you in orbit. If you hear this, break 
radio silence and reply.” 

Carrel rose from his seat, float- 
ing slightly upward. Albrekt, sweat- 
ing, dropped his hand to his heat 
gun. 

“We can’t stay in this sector, 
Vebrug,” whispered the radio. 
'“Blasting back to base now. Will 
call every five minutes for the next 
two hours. If you hear this, break 
radio silence and reply.” 



105 




The radio squawked. Then there 
was nothing but stellar static. 

“Well, Albrekt?” said Carrel. 

Albrekt felt his iron nerve crack- 
ing. He felt that he was breaking 
apart physically. 

“Keep your distance, all of you!” 
he croaked, drawing the gun. 
“They’ll be back. They’ll search all 
space for us!” 

Carrel floated a little closer and 
Albrekt levelled the gun at him. 
Migl and Qoqol moved in slightly. 
Albrekt swung the gun in an arc. 

“I’ll blast all three of you,” he 
warned desperately. “Carrel. 

“Why?” asked Carrel. “We’re all 
in the same boat, Albrekt. We’re 
spiralling into Jupiter.” 

“You lie!” shouted Albrekt. “I 
don’t believe you, Carrel!” 

Carrel laughed shortly. 

“Where’s your nerve, Albrekt?” 
he asked. “You’ve done pretty well 
up to now. Does the immediate 
prospect of dying frighten you so 
much?” 

Albrekt lowered the gun slightly. 

“If I were afraid to die I 
wouldn’t be here,” he replied. 
“You’re not baiting me for noth- 
ing, Carrel. What are you after?” 

“I don’t think you realize how 
many millions of miles your Flanjo 
ship had to come to the rendezvous 
point,” said Carrel. “As much as 
your friends want this cargo, they 
won’t stay around long. Solar 
Council ships probably heard that 
broadcast.” 

“What makes you think they can 
find us?” sneered Albrekt. “We 
can’t call them either.” 

“They can’t find us,” replied 
Carrel calmly. “The chances are a 
million to one against it, and we 
don’t have enough time for chances 

106 



like that.” 

Ice seemed to enter Albrekt’s 
veins. He glared at them from 
angry eyes. They were inching 
closer to him. Already they were 
halfway across the control room. 

“Stand back!” he said, his voice 
trembling. “I’ll bum all of you!” 

“And die alone, Albrekt?” Car- 
rel’s brittle voice was like the blow 
of a hammer against rock. 

On the screen behind Carrel, the 
orb of Jupiter floated off the port 
bow, red and ominous. Giant of 
the heavens, its tremendous mass 
could snatch them from the sky, 
crush and break them like moths. 

All the vast loneliness of space 
swept over Albrekt on wings of 
fear. It was too much for a planet- 
bound mind to face. The last com- 
panionship even of enemies was 
better than solitary death. 

“No,” he muttered, beaten, and 
the heat gun drooped in his hand. 
Qoqol’s eight-foot arm reached in 
like a striking snake to lift it from 
his nerveless grasp. 

“Good work, Qoqol,” said Car- 
rel heartily. “I had an idea the 
Flanjo tradition of superiority 
would break in the face of the in- 
evitable. It was worth risking, now 
that we know we’re safe.” 

“Safe?” said Albrekt bitterly. 
“Safe for what? To fall into Jupi- 
ter?” 

“Well, now,” said Carrel drolly, 
“I believe I neglected to say that 
our spiral toward Jupiter will in- 
tercept the Solar Council base on 
Callisto, didn’t I? Yes sir, it’s one 
of the neatest orbits Qoqol has 
ever plotted.” 

“What?” demanded Albrekt, 
stunned. “You mean we’re in a 
controlled orbit?” 



CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




“Why, yes, my Flanjo friend. We 
started pulling out of the orbits 
your blast tapes set about four 
months ago. If we hadn’t, we 
wouldn’t have come anywhere near 
Jupiter.” 

“You lie!” shouted Albrekt. 
“You lie, Carrel! You couldn’t! 
There’s no fuel!” 

“I’m afraid we’re going to have 
to keep you tied up to one of the 
bunks for the next few weeks, Al- 
brekt,” said Carrel. “You’re too 
valuable a prisoner to take a 
chance on your doing away with 
yourself.” 

“There’s no fuel,” repeated Al- 
brekt. He was almost whimpering. 

“I’ll relieve your mind on that 
score,” said Carrel. “Have you 
ever seen a sailing ship on Earth?” 

Albrekt stared at him, uncom- 
prehending. 

“A sailing ship doesn’t need fuel 
because it gets its power from the 



wind,” said Carrel. “Neither do we, 
now. I’m afraid that story I told 
you about dangerous radiation 
from Jupiter was made up of whole 
cloth, Albrekt. There isn’t any. 

“That lithium hemisphere we 
built isn’t a shield. It’s a sail.” 

“But there’s no wind — there’s no 
air — 

“The wind that blows between 
the worlds,” said Carrel solemnly. 
“Solar radiation. Its pressure will 
move a ship if you provide a sail 
that’s big enough and light enough 
— and that’s what we did.” 

“It’s impossible,” muttered Al- 
brekt, crouching back against the 
automatic pilot. 

“Not impossible, just extremely 
unusual this far out,” said Carrel. 
“If they ever let you out of prison, 
Albrekt, I think a trip to Venus 
would be worth your while. I think 
you’d find the annual space regatta 
particularly interesting.” • • • 



WORTH CITING 



RECENT DEMONSTRATIONS by chemists of the British Department 
of Scientific and Industrial Research have given indication of leading to 
a new, previously untapped source of power. In a series of extraordinary 
tests these men produced electricity by mixing fresh water with sea water. 

The osmotic pressure of sea water is about twenty atmospheres; and 
when a river mixes with the sea in nature, free energy equal to that ob- 
tainable from a waterfall 680 feet high is released and lost. 

The British experimenters put that osmotic pressure to work by separat- 
ing alternating layers of salt and fresh water by using alternate basic 
and acidic membranes. The membranes are connected in series and 
yield actual measurable amounts of electricity. A hydroelectric pile of 
forty-seven pairs of membranes, each three inches square, yielded a maxi- 
mum of fifieen milliwatts, not counting the internal resistance overcome. 

Our citation this month goes to these British chemists, who have 
taken the first concrete step toward giving the world a new source of 
power — one which has tremendous possibilities.

Timmy was getting too much 3-dimension televi- 
sion, and he was mistaking it for Mother Nature. 
So his parents took him out to see the natural won- 
ders, which he unhappily mistook for 3-D televi- 
sion . 

BY JERRY SOHL 



S HE HAD never seen violinists 
work so hard. They were run- 
ning their bows back and forth so 
fast their hands were blurred. The 
musicians’ faces were studies in 
concentration and the concertmas- 
ter — ^he wasn’t two feet from her — 
had worked himself into such a 
frenzy veins were standing out on 
his red face. 

Mrs. Briggs almost laughed, me 
way the conductor was sweeping 
his baton to within inches of her 
head. Several times she had an im- 
pulse to reach up and catch it. 

So this was Virilio! Disjointed, 
cacophonic, sometimes sweet but 
more often deafening. She had 
never caught him before. But it 
was just as advertised, all right. 
Exciting. And moving. She didn’t 



know if there was supposed to be a 
love theme in Virilio’s new Pleni- 
tude on a Thursday Afternoon^ 
but it definitely stirred her. 

Just then the door opened and 
Timmy came walking through the 
musicians, eating an apple. Once 
he stopped to stare at the tympani 
and a second fiddler’s bow kept 
running through his head. It was 
rather ghostly, Mrs. Briggs thought. 

“Timmy!” she yelled above the 
music. “I didn’t see you go. Where 
have you been?” As if she didn’t 
know. 

“Had to get a glass of water. The 
music made me thirsty,” he said 
loudly, taking his seat beside her. 
“This is a lousy program, Mom. 
What’s next?” 

Drama in History^ she said ab- 
109 





sently, her eyes on a flutist’s mus- 
tache, wondering how he managed 
to play. 

Timmy chomped on his apple, 
but in the face of his gustatory en- 
joyment she couldn’t find the heart 
to tell him to be quiet. 

At intermission, she left the El- 
room to let Timmy take in the 
commercial and returned in time 
for the beginning of Drama in His- 
tory, 

There was a salt spray in the air 
and a cool wind whipped around 
them as the lights went out com- 



pletely. The roar of waves grew 
loud and the deck creaked beneath 
their feet. 

The ship moved through the dim 
light. Sailors stood like statues 
about the deck. 

“We’re even with the inshore 
ships, sir!” a voice called hoarsely. 

“We’ve got the French between 
us, then.” Though he was a small 
man, there was a ring of authority 
in the voice of the man on the 
bridge. 

“There’s the Orient, sir!” 

“One of ours has gone aground!”

“She’ll mark the shoal for the 
rest of the fleet,” the little man re- 
plied calmly. “Ready, Mr. Cres- 
ton!” 

“What’s he think he’s doing?” 
the captain’s boy whispered. 

“Quiet, lad,” a peg-legged sailor 
said softly. “Admiral Nelson will 
see us through. You’ll have your 
share of action afore momin’, 
mate!” 

The darkness was split by far- 
away flashes of light. Instantly, 
there was returning cannon fire 
that caused the ship to shudder and 
"groan. The Battle of Aboukir Bay 
had begun. 

The red flashers above the door 
winked their message. 

“Damn!” Mrs. Briggs said, 
switching off. 

“Ma!” 

“There’s someone at the door, 
Timmy. If it’s a salesman — !” 

Mrs. Briggs checked the dials on 
the electrocooker as she went to 
the door. A small but efficient- 
looking woman in the standard 
white and blue of school uniforms 
had alighted from her g-car and 
stood at the door. 

The woman said she was Bernice 
Pomeroy from the office of the di- 
rector of Timmy’s public school 
and Mrs. Briggs, scarcely glancing 
at her offered identification card, 
pushed for mezzanine. The woman 
said nothing; she merely waited 
until the floor came down hydrau- 
lically to mez level. Then Mrs. 
Briggs ran the magnetic curtains 
around, and when they were pri- 
vate she saw that the woman was 
sitting on one of the soft lounge 
cushions, straight-backed, adjusting 
her glasses on the small bridge of 
her nose. She drew a sheaf of pa- 

THE ELROOM 



pert frokn her portfolio. 

“Mrs. Briggs,” Miss Pomeroy 
said, looking up with officious grey 
eyes. Then she saw Timmy. “Tim- 
my, I suppose.” 

“Yes.” Mrs. Briggs wished she’d 
get on with it. It was hard enough 
leaving Admiral Nelson at the 
mouth of the Nile, without having 
her settling down as if for all day. 

“Maybe it would be best,” Miss 
Pomeroy coughed a little, “if Tim- 
my — ” 

“If Timmy what?” 

“It’s about him, you see.” 

“I’ll send him to the Elroom.” 
“No,” Miss Pomeroy said at 
once. Then she added: “Perhaps 
it would be best if he stayed after 
all.” She riffled her papers. “Tim- 
niy’s latest Auden-Gronet test shows 
his personality has dropped at least 
five points from positive during the 
first half of the school year.” 

Mrs. Briggs looked at her nine- 
year-old son. He was down to the 
core of his apple now, a nice look- 
ing boy, she thought, with bright 
blue eyes, hair that insisted on 
drooping too far down on his fore- 
head — she’d have to start training 
it in earnest soon— and a fair sup- 
ply of freckles. He carried himself 
well. Had a pleasant speaking 
voice, she thought, and a good 
vocabulary. She had noticed no- 
slipping? 

“Timmy’s not too far behind 
factually, Mrs. Briggs,” Miss Pom- 
eroy said, referring to her records. 
“In fact, we’ll admit he’s ahead in 
stability and adjustment. But he’s 
getting more negative in aggres- 
siveness and personality develop- 
ment. He just doesn’t seem to care. 
That factor may account for his 
stability— he doesn’t have any rea- 

in 




son to be unstable, you see? And 
he adjusts easily because he doesn’t 
care enough not to. There is a rea- 
son, of course.” 

Mrs. Briggs was annoyed. The 
schools had gone too far. ‘‘And 
what, may I ask, is the reason?” 

“Too much time in the Elroom, 
Mrs. Briggs.” 

Mrs. Briggs managed a good- 
natured laugh. “Miss Pomeroy, you 
have Timmy all wrong. He doesn’t 
spend any more time in the Elroom 
than other children do.” 

“Children are all different,” Miss 
Pomeroy countered. 

“But not Timmy.” 

“Parents are often poor judges 
of their own children, Mrs. Briggs.” 

“Are you trying to tell me I don’t 
know my own child?” 

Mrs. Briggs, I am not trying to 
tell you anything,” Miss Pomeroy’s 
cheeks were red. “I am telling you 
your child is spending too much 
time watching these programs. 
Sublimating so much, in fact, that 
he’s beginning to find it difficult 
telling the difference between life 
itself and the Elroom.” 

“Sublimating?” 

“Escape. You didn’t know? 
Yes.” The teacher smiled tolerant- 
ly. “First sublimation room for 
elevating one’s self — sublime the 
verb. Then SubL for short. Then 
just L and L-room to Elroom. You 
didn’t know?” 

“That, my dear,” Mrs. Briggs 
said heatedly, “is just so much hog- 
wash.” 

“Tell me, Mrs. Briggs, just what 
does your husband think of the 
Elroom?” 

“He doesn’t have much time to 
spend in it.” 

“You mean he’d rather do some- 
112 



thing else?” 

“He’s interested in typically man 
things — cars, mostly.” Because 
Timmy had gone over to the cur- 
tains and was starting to walk 
through, and because she wanted 
to show Miss Pomeroy she was 
capable of some discipline, she 
said, “And where are you going, 
young man?” 

“Probably back to the Elroom,” 
Miss Pomeroy put in. Mrs. Briggs 
gave her an acid look. 

Timmy swallowed the last bite 
of apple. “To get a drink. I’m 
thirsty.” 

When he had gone. Miss Pom- 
eroy leaned forward. “You must 
keep him out of the Elroom, Mrs. 
Briggs. We’ll send you a list of pro- 
grams. He can have sublimation 
only one hour a day.” 

“Ridiculous!” Mrs. Briggs 
snapped. 

Miss Pomeroy adjusted her 
glasses and looked at her severely. 
“Are you saying you will not com- 
ply?” 

“I said it’s ridiculous, didn’t you 
hear? Why, you won’t find a better 
child than Timmy — ” 

“Obviously your only child.” 

“And what has that to do with 
it?” 

“It is not my job to explain,” 
Miss Pomeroy said icily. “Only to 
inform. I’m afraid I’ll have to re- 
port that you will not heed the 
directive.” 

“The Elroom is instructive. Why, 
we were learning something about 
history just now. We were watch- 
ing Nelson sink the French fleet 
when you came.” 

“It’s not the program. It’s the 
identification with it. Let’s say 
Timmy has too much imagination

— ^but then I have already told you 
what I came to tell. I’ll be going 
now, Mrs. Briggs.” 



F rom the way George sent 
the gyrocar into a long swoop 
that ended inside the garage, Laura 
Briggs knew her husband was angry 
and she braced herself for battle. 
But she wasn’t quite prepared for 
such an immediate outburst, the 
moment he got in the door. 

“Stoops!” he cried, robbed of 
slamming the door because of the 
automatic permaglass cushion. 
Timmy scurried away, frightened 
at this aspect of his father. “The 
psychocenter we’ve got to go to 
yet!” 

The electrocooker had dinged a 
minute ago, and Mrs. Briggs was 
ready to tahe everything out and 
put it on the table, but she could 
only look at him in amazement. 
“You’re not making sense!” 

“Ha!” George’s heavy eyebrows 
hovered high in his forehead, then 
plunged down over his eyes. His 
big face was crimson, his blue eyes 
steely. “Neither are they, and they 
called just before I left the office. 
Wouldn’t tell me why. Have you 
done anything?” 

“Well — ” Mrs. Briggs started 
tentatively and he gave her a sharp 
look. “It’s about the Elroom.” 
“The Elroom!” 

She told him about the visit of 
Miss Pomeroy. “She must have re- 
ported it.” 

“Then we’ll get rid of the 
damned thing!” His eyes bright- 
ened. “I told you we should have 
gotten a new car instead.” 

“But we’ve got a car, George.” 
“Not a good one.” He leaned 

THE ELROOM 



against the cooker, his face blissful. 
“Imagine us — us — driving a new 
Caddie gyro — room for eight, you 
know — supersonic drive — sleek, too 
— ^we could get a red one — ^you’d 
like red, wouldn’t you? — a thou- 
sand horsepower with twin turbos 
for level flight — and those off-cen- 
ter firing tubes with folding back 
overhead vertical flight pins — 
Gad!” 

“Our present car — ” 

“Junk!” 

“But it runs, and we don’t need 
a car like that for just in-town 
driving.” 

“But what about our vacation? 
Think of it, Laura: We could make 
it to Alaska, Tibet, Africa — we 
could go around the world in our 
three weeks.” 

“We could do the same with the 
Elroom, George. And there are a 
lot more things besides travel.” 
Mrs. Briggs’s lower lip was trem- 
bling. “You’re siding with those 
nasty school people. You think 
they’re right about Timmy.” 

“Where is he?” 

Timmy stuck his head up from 
behind the lounge. His big eyes 
were wide. 

“Look at him, George. Ever seen 
a more normal boy? How could 
they think a boy like that could get 
so involved in a program he’d think 
he was living it.” 

“Yeah, but if those school peo- 
ple—” 

Her eye caught the clock and 
she drew in her breath quickly. 
“Say! We’ve got to hurry if we’re 
going to see Cameron Capers/^ 

Dr. Vincent Potter was a large 
man with a shining expanse of flesh 
between two islands of black, bris- 



113 




tling hair above heavy brows that 
met over his nose and almost con- 
cealed the bright, intelligent eyes 
that glittered beneath them. 

“So. You cannot understand. 
Yes.” He nodded his head, made a 
tent with his hands, and rocked. 
“But this is what we are for. To 
understand. For you.” He smiled. 
“If understanding easily came, 
then we would be not needed. No? 
You see?” He laughed a little, 
jerked upright. The movement 
nearly made the three of them 
jump. 

“Doctor,” George said. “There 
are millions of kids in Elrooms all 
over the country.” 

“You tell me something new?” 
The doctor frowned. “Millions of 
people there are. So? Must they be 
alike every one? They are not. 
Yes?” The doctor leaned toward 
Timmy who was playing with a 
desk calendar. “Who is your 
mother?” Timmy pointed to Mrs. 
Briggs. “Your father?” Timmy 
pointed to George. “See? He 
knows.” 

“Of course,” Mrs. Briggs said. 

“Exactly,” the doctor agreed. 
Then he was upright, waving his 
forefinger before them, looking 
from beneath dark brows. “For 
how long, Mrs. Briggs? For how 
long, I am asking? And now, I am 
telling how long. Who knows? 
Who can tell how many times you 
will let him see these things?” 

“What day is today?” Timmy 
asked. 

“He is asking what day it is,” the 
doctor laughed. 

“Well, why don’t you answer 
him?” Mrs. Briggs suggested. 

“The twelfth of June,” the doc- 
tor said. “And why does Timmy 

114 



ask such a question?” 

‘^You forgot to tear off yester- 
day.” And Timmy tore the little 
sheet off, proceeded to make a dart 
of it. 

“Well, what you’ve been mean- 
ing to say,” George said, “is that 
we’re going to have to cut down 
on Timmy’s Elroom time.” 

“Aw, Dad!” Timmy protested. 

“No. Cut it down we will not 
do.” The doctor shook his head 
gravely. “We will cut it out alto- 
gether.” 

“Cut it out?” George said hope- 
fully. He leaned forward with in- 
terest. “Maybe we should get rid 
of our outfit?” 

“Mr. Briggs. You do not know, 
perhaps, sublimation can be dan- 
gerous. Confusing reality, stimulat- 
ing unreality, stunting thinking, 
bringing on neuroses. Tolerance. 
He needs tolerance. Timmy cannot 
develop tolerance with too much 
of a dose, as he has had. Do you 
see now? The AG test — ah! — it is 
good. It shows us he is leaving 
reality. We can’t let him psychotic 
become.” 

“But he doesn’t believe the pro- 
grams!” Mrs. Briggs exclaimed. 

“Not yet, Mrs. Briggs! Not yet. 
If he sublimes enough he will soon, 
though. No?” 

“I can’t stand the thought of 
locking Timmy out of it,” Mrs. 
Briggs said sadly. 

“I’m in favor of getting rid of 
it,” George muttered. “There are 
other things — cars — ” 

Dr. Potter took an official form 
from a drawer. “A change of en- 
vironment you need. Timmy needs. 
You leave tomorrow on a month’s 
vacation.” 

“But my vacation doesn’t come 
JERRY SOHL 




up for six months,” George said. 
“Or doesn’t that matter?” he add- 
ed hopefully. 

“You will leave tomorrow, as 
said. No? Your office will I inform 
of the necessary departure. Sector 
administration will be knowing.” 
He wrote on a sheet of paper. “The 
colorful spots. That you will see. 
Timmy will see things as they real- 
ly are. Itineraries will send the 
route by facsimile. Good. Not?” 
“Why, I think it’s wonderful!” 
George said. 

“Timmy must see the sunrise. 
The sea, he must swim in. Things, 
he must do. Remember. Yes?” 
“Yes,” George said. “No?” He 
turned to his wife. “There’s an 
agency where we can rent a car — 
and they have new Caddies — 



HE TAPERING white obelisk 
thrust upward from the earth 
like a giant needle. The Briggses 
entered the base of it, went up the 
elevator, and caught glimpses of 
stairway landings as the cage rose 
slowly. When they stepped out on 
the platform near the top, they 
walked to the pair of port openings 
on one side and looked out. 

In the time it had taken them to 
get to the top of Washington 
Monument, a light fog, borne on 
the slight evening breeze, had en- 
veloped the tall shaft at its mid- 
section; they could see nothing of 
the ground below. They were iso- 
lated from Earth, connected to it 
only by the elevator well. 

“Isn’t this eerie?” Mrs. Briggs 
asked Timmy. 

He looked around casually and 
yawned. “On an Elroom program,” 
he said, “you would be able to see 

THE ELROOM 



all the way down. I don’t think 
this is so hot.” He yawned again. 
“I’m thirsty.” 

“We’ll be going down in a min- 
ute, Timmy.” 

“I’ve got the route figured bet- 
ter than Itineraries for the next 
stop,” George said. “If we could 
leave in twenty minutes — ” 

Aragonite crystals on the cav- 
ern’s ceiling twinkled brightly in 
reflection of glowing electric lights. 
The fragile beauty of the boxwork 
formation took Mrs. Briggs’s breath 
away. 

“It’s just like lace,” she whis- 
pered to George, pointing to the 
frosty tracery glistening in the 
honeycombed walls. 

“Tom Bingham discovered this 
cave,” the guide intoned before the 
tourists seated in the giant cham- 
ber, his voice echoing from the 
walls. “He heard a whistling soimd 
and found it came from a small 
opening. That’s why they call this 
Wind Cave. The wind goes in and 
out.” 

“Why does it do that?” someone 
asked. 

“Difference in atmospheric pres- 
sure,” the ^ide said. “Another in- 
teresting thing about this cave: It’s 
always forty-seven degrees. Doesn’t 
make any difference whether it’s 
summer or winter. Always the same 
in here.” 

“I don’t hear any wind,” Timmy 
said to his mother and father. 
“Why isn’t the wind whistling?” 

“When the barometer falls, the 
wind blows out,” his father ex- 
plained. “When the barometer 
rises, the wind blows in.” 

“Why isn’t the wind whistling 
now?” Timmy insisted. 




115 




“The barometer must be stand- 
ing still, son.” 

“This isn’t any good. On an El- 
room program the wind would be 
whistling.” 

“Hush,” Mrs. Briggs said. 

“I’m thirsty,” Timmy said. 

“We’ll be leaving in a few min- 
utes.” 

“You’ll get plenty of wind when 
I rev up Xht Caddie on our next 
hop,” George said. 

“Think of that,” George said. 
“It’s a whole mile down to the 
river.” 

Timmy leaned forward to take 
a deep look over the precipice at 
Yaki point. 

“Boy!” he said. “This is pretty 
good. Almost makes me dizzy.” 

Below, the Colorado River was 
bright quicksilver, threading its 
way circuitously through the can- 
yon. The striated walls rose ma- 
jestically from the floor to tower- 
ing temples. 

The boy turned from the rock 
to look at the tufts of clouds float- 
ing by in the deep blue sky. 

“I’m thirsty,” he said. 

Mrs. Briggs, still fascinated by 
the view, said, “Well, go get a 
drink, then.” 

Timmy walked over the edge, 
screamed as he fell. 

Mrs. Briggs could only stare, 
stunned. 

George uttered a cry and ran to 
the cliff’s rim. 

Tourists nearby ran up, looked 
down with George. 



A hundred feet below on the 
slope at a point where it dropped 
off to nothing, a horrified Timmy 
was crouched clutching a small 
tree. 

“Hold on!” George called en- 
couragingly. 

A few minutes later someone had 
found a long rope in a gyrocar 
trunk and roped it about George’s 
middle. They let him over the edge 
gently, dropped him down the 
slope slowly. 

“Hang on, Timmy!” George 
yelled, running a tongue over dry 
lips and momentarily closing his 
eyes to the dizzying depths. “Don’t 
let the little rocl^ coming down 
worry you.” 

A while later, a dust-streaked 
Timmy was back on the ledge in 
his mother’s arms, sobbing. 

George, his shirt wet with sweat, 
and struggling out of the rope, 
panted : “Whatever came over you, 
Timmy?” 

“It was so real I thought it was 
the Elroom. I was just going out to 
the kitchen to get a drink of 
water.” 

“And I — I told him to go,” Mrs. 
Briggs said, horrified. “It was that 
real to me, too.”

SCIEMGE 



BRIEFS 



Eye specialists of the future may 
be using an electronic magnet to 
take foreign bodies from the eyes. 
Magnets in use today do not attract 
non-iron metals such as silver, 
aluminum, brass, copper and vari- 
ous others, and at least 25% of the 
eye injuries which cause loss of 
sight are due to such non-iron frag- 
ments. The new device now in the 
development stages at the Army 
Medical Center will, when per- 
fected, remove all such foreign ob- 
jects cleanly and without more 
than minor damage to the delicate 
tissues. 



A new step toward the automatic 
factory of the future is an auto- 
matic punch press with an elec- 
tronic “brain”. Directions are fed 
to the punch press by an electronic 
digital computer which “reads” a 
perforated card for information on 
the size, number and location of the 
holes to be punched. The press 
automatically positions the material 
to be perforated and performs the 
operation within an accuracy of a 
few thousandths of an inch. New 
directions for the press are simply 
a matter of a new card, with no 
time lost for retooling or the re- 
training of an operator. 

Human beings won’t be called upon 
to act as guinea pigs in cell studies 



in the days to come. A new method 
of serial cultivation of human cells 
has been announced which will en- 
able microbe and disease hunters to 
grow living bits of normal tissue in 
test tubes. The key to the new tech- 
nique seems to be a time period for 
adjustment to an artificial environ- 
ment. The new method makes it 
possible to get information concern- 
ing cell nutrition, cell chemistry 
and the effects of viruses, all of 
which was unobtainable before ex- 
cept by the infection of human 
volunteers. 

Industry may be able to eliminate 
the costly building and testing of 
expensive prototype engines with a 
new gadget. If the electronic device 
works as predicted, it will make it 
possible to test the performance of 
jet engines, nuclear reactors and 
the like while they are still on the 
drawing board. Able to simulate 
the thermal behavior of materials 
under rapid and intense tempera- 
ture changes, the device enables an 
accompanying computer to predict 
the performance of a proposed 
structure from design factors and 
known material properties. Ther- 
mal behavior is simulated by ex- 
hibiting a corresponding electrical 
behavior under the influence of 
electrical current. The Computer 
solves the problem of the thermal 
behavior of any new or existing de- 
sign by the simple principle of 
analogy. 

Housewives may soon be asking the 
grocer for a box of tomato juice. 
This newest addition to the grow- 
ing list of fruit powders is processed 
by directly vacuum drying tomato 
paste, and can quickly be restored 

117 




to liquid juice by the simple addi- 
tion of water. Although the drying 
process is as expensive as the pres- 
ent one of adding water to make 
commercial tomato juice, the sav- 
ing in storage space and freight 
costs make it a much more economi- 
cal product for both civilian and 
military use. 

Medical men of the future may be 
able to make much more accxirate 
diagnosis of cancer and other dis- 
eases of the soft internal organs and 
tissues. A new device known as a 
Somascope, which combines the 
principles of radar, sonar and tele- 
vision may soon supplement the 
X-ray and the fluoroscope. This 
ultrasonic photographing gadget is 
expected to give well defined pic- 
tures of diseased cells where none 
can now be detected. The patient

Jets, rockets and helicopters may 

not be the only aircraft in the skies 
of tomorrow. Recent tests demon- 
strated the unique abilities of a 
channel wing plane weighing 2.5 
tons and propeller driven, which is 
able to hover at about eleven miles 
an hour without crashing. Two 
pusher-propeller engines are 
mounted on wings which resemble 
half-barrels; and with this equip- 
ment the plane can climb 3000 feet 
a minute after using less than two 
hundred feet of runway. The slow- 
motion plane can also do 180 miles 
an hour and develop as much lift 
per horsepower at eleven miles an 
hour as commercial airliners de- 
velop at regular speeds. 

The smog problem which plagues 
so many industrial areas may be 
licked in the not too distant future 
by the development of lightweight 
fuels. A proposal has been made to 
redesign motor fuels so that the 
heavier components with molecular 
weights of 150 to 200 which usually 
escape combustion and are thrown 
out into the atmosphere to create 
smog are eliminated. A change to 
compounds with a weight of 50 to 
55, such as propane and butane 
would solve the problem. These 



118 




fuels could be made to burn more 
efficiently and leave nothing but 
carbon ffioxide and water. Motor 
redesign would simply consist of re- 
placing the present day air-vented 
gasoline tank with a pressure tank 
to contain the liquid petroleum gas. 

Your dinner menu may soon have 
flying fish on it. Officials of the U.S. 



Fish and Wildlife Service report 
that fresh flying fish makes a good 
meal and have proposed that a fly- 
ing fish canning industry be set up 
in the Barbados Islands where this 
aviation-minded fish is a popular 
food. It is hoped that the needs of 
food shortages may possibly be filled 
by this new addition to the list of 
edible sea food.

tramping the snow down into a 
flat, hard floor. He broke his branch 
into short lengths over his knee, 
then, in a nearly forgotten gesture, 
slapped at his uniform until he re- 
membered that he had no pockets. 
For a moment he stood still, his 
eyes roving over the side of the 
ship until it came to one of the 
jagged tears. With a little self-con- 
gratulatory chuckle, he began 
scraping one of the lengths of wood 
over the torn metal, catching the 
splinters and shavings in the palm 
of one hand. 

Allison dropped his armload of 
branches by the ship, waged an 
inner battle between fear of the 
unknown and curiosity in which 
curiosity won, and stood watching 
Endicott arrange the branches in 
a crib around the neatly piled shav- 
ings. Endicott, on one knee by the 
crib, worked steadily, laying the 
pieces of wood with care and a re- 
turning sense of sureness, with only 



brief pauses to flex his freezing 
fingers. Finally, with a smile of 
satisfaction on his face, Endicott 
got to his feet, and the nearly for- 
gotten gesture at the pocketless 
uniform was repeated. 

Slowly, Endicott’s lined face 
altered. He looked hastily at the 
watchful Allison and hastily looked 
away; he looked at the completed 
crib, and his tongue licked his lips; 
he looked along the side of the 
damaged ship, and his eyes nar- 
rowed thoughtfully; finally, he 
looked into the swirl of the icy 
snow, and he shivered. His hands 
ceased their pawing, fell slowly, 
to hang slack by his sides. He was 
not smiling as he turned away. 

“What were you looking for?’’ 
Allison asked curiously. 

“I just remembered something 
else,” said Endicott, his voice was 
very soft in the stillness, “we used 
to have something called a match 
to start those picnic fires.” • • •

FOR REAL JOB SECURITY 
-GET I.C.S. TRAINING 




“You can stop worrying, Jane. 
My job’s secure now! And here’s 
the insurance policy to prove it— 
my I.C.S. diploma!” 

This feeling of security is 
probably typical of every l.C.S. 
graduate. Because— as the job 
situation gets tighter, the man 
with l.C.S. training has the 
advantage. 

Why? Your I.C.S. diploma tells 
your present employer three im« 
portant things: (1) You want to 
make the most of your present job. 



(2) You have the training you 
need for advancement. (3) You 
look for better ways of doing things 
on your own. 

What you do about your fu- 
ture is up to you. Do nothing 
and stay at your present job at 
the same old pay. Or earn an 
l.C.S. diploma in your spare 
time for security, promotions, 
more pay! Your first step is to 
mark the course that interests 
you in the coupon below, and 
mail it to us. 

free books 

We’ll send you two interesting 
books. The first, “How to Suc- 
ceed,” is a gold mine of helpful 
tips. Points out many small things 
in your personality and behavior 
that can make the difference be- 
tween success and failure. The 
second book tells you about the 
opportunities in the field of your 
choice. 



Costs pennies a day 

Many an I.CS. student has made 
up the cost of his course in one 
month with the salary increase his 
l.C.S. training earned for him. By 
studying at home in your spare 
time, you pay yourself many times 
an hour more than you’re now 
making. (One student reports — 
“My LC.S. course was worth $95 
an hour to me.”) 

The security of your pres- 
ent job— or the success in find- 
ing the new job you’ve always 
wanted— is in your hands. Move 
ahead with I. C. S. training 
while others stay behind on the 
routine, small-pay jobs. Re- 
member, your first step to se- 
curity and success is to mail 
this coupon. Take a few min- 
utes and do it note. If you put 
it off, it can cost you your 
future.
