The Daj After Tom4»rr<»^w 



L ooking into the future of 
science fiction is tricky busi- 
ness. Any prediction is a risk. A 
prediction of what so quintessen- 
tially a predictive technique as 
the writing of science fiction may 
be like at some later date than 
this one is not merely twice as 
risky: it is folly squared. 

But it seems to us that there 
are trends. And this fifteenth an- 
niversary issue of Galaxy may be 
a good time to set a few remarks 
about them down. 

The first real science-fiction 
magazine appeared not quite for- 
ty years ago, in the spring of 
1926. It was edited by Hugo 
Gernsback and its principal sub- 
stance was the kind of stories 
Gernsback himself used to write: 
a sort of animated catalogue of 
gadgets. Granting that was what 
he did, he did it superbly, and 
as a matter of fact much of 
science fiction’s record of accur- 
ate predictions stems from those 
early Gernsback-type stories: ra- 
dar, television, atomic power, roc- 
kets, etc,, et al. The mixture was 
flavored with a heavy admixture 
of H, G, Wells reprints (sermons 
and polemics, beautifully writ- 
ten), and a trace of Edgar Rice 
Burroughs: and that tonic bright- 



ened the lives of lots of i)eo])le 
for nearly a decade. 

Then a man named Stanley G. 
Weinbaurn came along with a 
revolutionary idea. It was his 
thought that you could give some 
sort of three-dimensional reality 
to the characters in science-fic- 
tion stories. He was not quite so 
daring as to try it with his human 
beings, but his Martians, his Ven- 
usians and his Ganynicdan bal- 
loon-heads are still vividly -c- 
membered as persons a third of 
a century later. 

Less than a decade later Jolin 
Campbell came up with a firsli 
and fascinating mixture: write 
your stories, he told his writers, 
as though they were going to be 
printed as contemporary fiction 
in a magazine of the 22d century. 
And they did it; and they did it 
very well. L. Sprague de Camp, 
Robert A. Heinlein, Lester ilel 
Rey and any number of otliers 
responded with stories that an- in 
print on the pocketbook racks 
right now. And about ten ye.irs 
after that it was Galaxy's turn; 
and with H. L. Gold as ediior 
another new batch of ingredients 
were added. Thei.- names were wit^ 
and relevance; and they were 
compounded by writers like Roh .

Secrets 
entrusted 
to a 
few 



THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

Bester, Damon Knight, the late 
C. M. Kornbluth and others — 
including most of those in this 
issue 

Well, this is an attempt to look 
ahead, not a history of science 
fiction. But oversimplified and 
sketchy though what we have 
just said may be, it illustrates a 
principle. Science fiction ad- 
vances in a series of quantum 
jumps. 

It may seem to you from the 
above timetable that we are 
about due for another jump. 

It seems so to us, too; and as 
a matter of fact, we think we’re 
in it rig.it now. 

■’I XTith negligible exceptions 
' ’ (Wells, Stapledon and 
who?), nearly every science-fic- 
tion writer up to a very few 
years ago made one hidden — 
and indefensible — assumption. 
They assumed that science 
changed; that the world chang- 
ed ; that everything you could 
imagine changed, except one 
thing. They assumed that the 
human race did not change at 
all. 

And of course the human race 
does. It has been changing from 
the day the first australopithe- 
cine picked up an antelope femur 
and broke it over a dire-wolf’s 
head. It is changing now, just as 
it has throughout the human 



past; the only difference is that 
now it is changing more rapidly 
than ever before. It will be 
changing tomorrow, too; but it 
will be changing faster still. 

It is technology that is chang- 
ing us so rapidly, of course. As 
man remakes his environment he 
changes the Darwinian criteria 
of what, exactly, is “fittest”. Cala- 
mity criers have made much of 
the black side of this picture: we 
are breeding a race of cripples, 
they say, pointing to what mod- 
ern medicine has done to take the 
sting out of incurable genetic 
flaws. (One of the traits the hu- 
man race seems to have had for 
a good many generations is this 
same habit of preserving its “un- 
fit”. How many remember that 
the first Neanderthal skeleton 
gave a very erroneous picture of 
the species because it chanced to 
be that of a middle-aged man 
with an advanced case of arthrit- 
is? He could not have survived 
by himself; he had to have been 
preserved, fed and cared for. 

The interesting thing about 
technological change is that its 
rate of growth gives every sign 
of being exponential. The oldest 
computer, if it were human, 
would just barely be able to vote; 
but in rather less than a human 
generation the computers have 
firmly and irrevocably . changed 
the rate of change. Visiting the 
Harvard-Smithsonian Astrophysi- 



6 



cal Observatory the other day, 
we talked to a man named Owen 
Gingerich who, last Christmas, 
duplicated the work of Johann 
Kepler in determining the laws of 
planetary orbits. It took Kepler 
three or four years to work out 
the laws a few centuries ago. 
Last Christmas, using the same 
observed data and the same 
mathematical procedures, Ging- 
erich repeated the process in 
eight days. Eight days of his own 
human time, that is. Those eight 
days were spent merely in setting 
up the problem so that a com- 
puter could solve it; and the 
actual operating time of the com- 
puter was twelve point four sec- 
onds. 

'"T^o those who have been read- 
ing stories by, for example. 
Jack Vance and Cordwainer 
Smith in Galaxy lately, this news 
is no news. For that is what they 
and others have been writing 
about: Not you and we trans- 
planted into the world of the 
future, but the people of the 
world of the future operating on 
their own terms. Perhaps they 
will think faster and more surely 
than we (by a factor of three 
years divided by twelve point four 
seconds, for example). Perhaps 
they will have traveled so far 
from us that even computers are 
no longer relevant to their lives, 
as Vance described in The Drag 



on Masters (and in the new 
manuscript,, just in, called Tho 
Last Castle, which we will be 
bringing you before long. 

They may in fact differ from 
us in ways that we can’t as yet 
guess; but what is important is 
to realize that they will differ 
from us. As John Pierce says, 
there is only one future in a tan- 
gible sense; that is, when it gets 
here there will only be the one 
single set of events that will take 
place. But our discussions of the 
future can take the form of end- 
less alternative worlds. We don’t 
know which will be the “true” 
future — so we might as well im- 
agine as many as we can. 

Well, that’s what we’re bend- 
ing every effort to bring you in 
Galaxy’s future. 

Be specific? All right. As you 
can see, Robert Sheckley’s back 
with us — and to stay, it seems, 
because he’s working on a batch 
of new ones for us right now. 

Cordwainer Smith is off in 
the South Pacific on an an- 
thropological expedition but 
before he left he finished Under 
Old Earth which strikes us as one 
of his best stories ever. Keith 
Laumer will be coming up again; 
so will Isaac Asimov: so will 
Robert Silverberg; so will . 

Well, that’s looking far enough 
ahead. The rest of the forecast- 
ing we’ll leave to the writers!

/^ver everyone in the room, or 
perhaps it was a park, the 
lighting cast shapes and symbols 
of color. The girl in the filmy 
gown had at one moment glitter- 
ing pink eyes, and at the next an 
aura of silvery hair. The man 
next to Forrester had golden skin 
and a mask of shadow. Wisps of 
odor drifted past him, rosebuds 
following sage. There were 
snatches of a crystalline, far-off 
music. 

"I’m rich!” he yelled. “And 
alive!” 

No one seemed to mind. For- 
rester plucked one of the color- 
less grapes Kara had recom- 
mended to him, rose, patted the 
girl in the filmy dress and 
walked unsteadily down to the 
pool where the revelers splashed 
and swam in a naked tangle. 
In spite of the long post-revival 
indoctrinatior that had given him 
so many new things and removed 
so much trash that was old, For- 
rester had not lost the habit of 
prurience. 

“It’s Forrester the rich man!” 
one of them shouted. Forrester 
smiled and waved. A girl cried, 
“Sing him a song! A song!” And 
they all splashed and sang: 

Oh, he died and died and 

died — 

(SPLASH) 

10 



And he cried and he cried and 
he cried — 

(SPLASH) 

With his rages and his cholers 
he’s a puzzle to the scholars. 
And he’s got a quarter of a 
million dollars! 

Forrester! 

(SPLASH, SPLASH) 

Forrescer ducked without 
thinking, then relaxed. He al- 
lowed them to drench him with 
the warm, scented water. “En- 
joy, enjoy!” he cried, grinning at 
the bare bodies. Bronze and 
ivory, lean or soft, every body 
was beautiful. He knew that 
none of them would think the 
worse of him if he touched the 
two snaps at throat and waist 
and .stepped out of his clothes 
to join them. But he also knew 
that his body would not compare 
well with the Adonises, would 
not impress the full-breasted 
Venuses, and so he stayed on 
the rim. “Drink and be merry, 
for yesterday we died,” he called 
and squirted them at random 
with his joymaker. He didn’t 
mind that he was not as beauti- 
ful as they. At least, not at this 
moment. He was happy. Nothing 
was troubling him. Not worry, 
not weariness, not fear. Not even 
his conscience; for, although he 
was wasting time, he had a right 
to waste time. 

Hara had said so. “Relax.” ad- 
GALAXY 



vised Hara. “Get acclimated. Go 
slow. You’ve been dead a long 
time.” Forrester was well content 
to follow his advice. In the morn- 
ing he would take things serious- 
ly. In the morning he would go 
out into this world and make a 
place for himself. With unas- 
suming pride he thought that he 
would do this not because he 
really needed to, for he had that 
quarter of a million dollars all 
right, but because it was proper 
that he should work and earn 
joy. He would be a good citizen. 

Experimentally he shouted 
what he thought of as a friendly 
obscene suggestion to one of the 
girls (although Hara had said 
that the talk of this time con- 
tained no obscenities). In return 
she made a charming gesture, 
which Forrester tried to think .of 
as an obscene one, and her com- 
paiiion, stretched out at the edge 
of the pool, drowsily lifted his 
joymaker and drenched Forrest- 
er with a tingling spray that, 
startlingly, brought him to an 
instant thrill of sexual excite- 
ment and then left him replete 
and momentarily exhausted. 

What a delightful way to live, 
Forrester thought. He turned and 
walked away, followed by song: 

And he slept and he slept 
and he slept. 

And he wept and he wept 
and he wept — 



Is he damning? Is he doom- 
ing? 

For that matter, is he hu- 
man? 

Forrester! 

But he was too far away for 
them to splash him now, and he 
had seen someone he wanted to 
talk to. 

It was a girl. She had just 
come in and was still rather 
sober. She was alone. And she 
was quite as tall as Forrester 
himself. 

Hara would introduce him if 
asked, Forrester knew, since this 
was more or less Hara’s party. 
But he did not at that moment 
see Hara. Didn’t need Hara, 
either, he decided. He walked 
up to the girl and touched her 
on the arm. 

“I am Charles D. Forrester,” 
he said. “I am six hundred and 
twenty-six old. I have a quarter 
of a million dollars. This is my 
first day out of the sleep-freeze, 
and I would appreciate it if you 
would sit down and talk to me 
for a while, or kiss me.” 

“Certainly,” she said, taking 
his hand. “Let’s lie down here 
on the violets. Careful of my 
joymaker; it’s loaded with some- 
thing special.” 

TTalf an hour later Hara came 
by and found them, lying 
on their backs, each with an arm 



THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT

under the other, heads inclined 
toward each other. 

Forrester noticed him at once, 
but went on talking to the girl. 
They had been plucking and 
eating the glass-clear grapes 
from a vine over their heads. The 
intoxicating fruit, the occasion 
and his general sense of well be- 
ing combined to erase social ob- 
ligations from his mind. Any- 
way, Hara would understand and 
forgive any offense. “Don’t mind 
him, dear,’’ Forrester said to the 
girl. “You were telling me not 
to sign up as a donor.” 

“Or as game. A lot of green- 
horns fall for that, because the 
money’s good. But the way they 
get you is that you don’t figure 
what it will cost in the long 
run.” 

“That’s very interesting,” said 
Forrester, then sighed, looked 
away from the girl and nodded 
up at Hara. “You know, flara,” 
he said, “you’re a drag.” 

“And you’re a drunk,” said 
Hara. “Hello, Tip. You two seem 
to be getting on well enough.” 
“He’s nice,” the girl said. “Of 
course, you’re nice too, Tip. Is it 
time for the champagne wine?” 
“Well past. That’s why I came 
looking for you. I went to a lot 
of trouble to get this champagne 
wine for the party, and Forrester 
will damn well get up and drink 
some to show the rest of us how 
it’s done.” 



“You tilt,” said Forrester, “and 
you pour.” 

Hara looked at him more 
carefully, shook his head and 
fingered his joymaker. “Don’t 
you remember anything I tell 
you?” he chided, and sprayed 
Forrester with what felt for a 
moment like an invigorating, and 
not at all shocking, ice-cold 
shower. “Not too drunk tonight. 
Get adjusted. Do what I tell 
you, will you? And now let’s see 
about this champagne wine.” 

Forrester got up like an obed- 
ient child and trailed after Hara 
toward the dispensing tables, one 
arm around the girl. She had pale 
hair, up in a fluffy crown, and the 
tricks of the lighting made it 
look as though fireflies nested in 
it. 

In the event that he ever saw 
Dorothy again, Forrester 
thought, he might have to give 
this sort of thing up. But for the 
time being it was very pleasant. 
And reassuring. It was hard for 
him to remember, when he had 
an arm around a pretty girl, that 
ninety days before his body had 
been a cryogenic crystal in an 
ambience of liquid helium, with 
his heart stopped and his brain 
still and his lungs a clot of de- 
stroyed scar tissue. 

He popped the cork of the 
champagne like a good fellow, 
toasted and drank. He had never 
seen the label before, but it was 



12 



GALAXY 



champagne all right. At Hara’s 
request he roared the verses of 
The Bastard King of England 
amid much applause, and would 
not let anyone sober him though 
he knew he was beginning again 
to reel and stammer. “You de- 
cadent sods,” he bellowed am- 
iably, “you know so much! But 
you don’t know how to get 
drunk.” 

They were dancing, a linlisd 
circle of all tv/enty-odd of them 
with foot-stamping and sudden 
changes of direction, a little like 
a Morris dance, a little like a 
Paul Jones, to music like pizzi- 
cato cello and the piping of 
flutes. The girl cried, “Oh, 
Charles! Charles Forrester! You 
almost make an Arcadian of 
me!” He nodded and grinned and 
clung to her on his right, and to 
a huge creature in orange tights 
on his left, a man who, some- 
one said, had just returned from 
Mars and was stumbling and 
straining in Earth’s gravity. But 
he was laughing. Everyone was 
laughing. A lot of them seemed 
to be laughing at Forrester, per- 
haps at his clumsy attempts to 
follow the step. 

That was almost the last he 
remembered. There was some 
shouting about what to do with 
him, a proposal to sober him up, 
a veto, a long giggling debate 
while he nodded happily like a 
whiskered head on a spring. He 



did not know when the paity 
ended. He had a dreamlike 
memory of the girl leading aim 
across an empty way bet\\'een 
tall, dark structures like monu- 
ments, while he shouted and sang 
to the echoes. He remembered 
kissing the girl, and some vag- 
rant aphrodisiac wisp from her 
joymaker that filled him with a 
confused emotion of mingled de- 
sire and fear. But he did not re- 
member returning to bis room 
or going to sleep. 

And when he woke In the 
morning he was buoyant, rested, 
vigorous and alone. 

II 

'"T^he bed in which Forrester 
woke was oval, springy and 
gently warm. It woke him by 
purring faintly at him, soothing- 
ly and cheerfully. Then as he 
began to stir the purring stopped, 
and the surface beneath his body 
gently began to knead his 
muscles. Lights came on. There 
was a distant sound of lively 
music, like a Gypsy trio. For- 
rester stretched, yawned, ex- 
plored his teeth with his tongue 
and sat up. 

“Good morning, Man Forres- 
ter,” said the bed. “It is eight- 
fifty hours and you have an ap- 
pointment at nine seventy-five. 
Would you like me to tell you 
your calls?” 



THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



13 



“Not now,” said Forrester at 
once. Hara had told him about 
the bed. It did not startle him. 
It was a convenience, not a 
threat. It was one more com- 
fortable part of this very amiable 
world. 

Forrester, who had been thirty- 
seven years old when he was 
burned to death and still con- 
sidered that to be his age, lit a 
cigarette, considered his situation 
carefully and decided that it was 
a state unmatched by any other 
thirty-seven year old man in 
the history of the world. He had 
it made. Life. Health. Good 
company. And a quarter of a mil- 
lion dollars. 

He was not, of course, as 
unique as he thought. But as he 
had not yet fully accepted the 
fact that he had himself been 
dead and was now returned to 
life, much less that there were 
millions upon millions like him, 
it ielt unique. It felt very good. 

“I have just received another 
message for you, Man Forrester,’’ 
said the bed. 

“Save it,” said Forrester. “Af- 
ter I have a cup of coffee.” 

“Do you wish me to send you 
a cup of coffee, Man Forrester?” 

“You’re a nag, you know that? 
I’ll tell you what I want and 
when I want it.” 

What Forrester really wanted, 
although he had not articulated 
it even to himself, was to go on 



enjoying for a moment the sen- 
sation of being uncommitted. It 
was like a liberation. It was like 
that first week of basic training, 
in the Army, when he realized 
that there was a hard way to get 
through this hitch and an easy 
one, and that the easy one, which 
entailed making no decisions of 
his own and taking no iniciative, 
but merely doing what he was 
told, was like nothing so much 
as a rather prolonged holiday in 
a somewhat poorly equipped 
summer camp for adults. 

Here the accommodations 
were in fact sumptuous. But the 
principle was the same. He did 
not have to concern himself with 
obligations. He had no obliga- 
tions. He didn’t have to worry 
about making sure the kids got 
up for school, because he no 
longer had any children. He 
didn’t have to think about 
whether his wife had enough 
money to get through the day, 
because he didn’t now have a 
wife. If he wanted to, ha could 
now roll over, pull the covers 
over his head and go to sleep. 
No one would stop him. no one 
would be aggrieved. If he chose, 
he could get drunk, attempt the 
seduction of a girl or write a 
poem. All of his debts were paid 
— or forgiven, centuries since. 
Every promise was redeemed — 
or had passed beyond the chance 
of redemption. The lie he had

told Dorothy about that week- 
end in 1962 need trouble him no 
longer. If the truth now came 
out, no one would care; and it 
wa.s all but impossible that the 
truth should ever come out. 

He had, in short, a blank 
check on life. 

More than that, he had a pret- 
ty substantially underwritten 
guarantee of continuing life it- 
self. He wasn’t sick. He wasn’t 
even threatened; even the lump 
on his leg, which he had once or 
twice gazed on with some worry 
in the days before 'nis death, 
could not be malignant or threat- 
ening, for if it were the doctors 
at the dormer would have fixed 
it. He need not even worry about 
being run over by a car — if 
there were cars — since at worst 
that might mean only another 
few centuries in the Oath of 
liquid helium, and then back to 
life — better than ever! 

He had, in fact, everytliing he 
had ever wished for. 

The only things he didn’t have 
were those he had not wished 
for because he already had them 
. e.g., family. Friends. Status. 

In this life of the year 2527 
A.D., Charles Forrester was en- 
tirely free. But he was not so 
joyous as to be blinded to the 
fact that this coin of his treasure 
had two sides. Another way of 
looking at it was that he was 
entirely superfluous. 



Tan Forrester,” said the 
bed, “I must insist. I 
have both an urgent- class mes- 
sage and a personal-visit not- 
ice.” And the mattress curled un- 
der him, humped itself and de- 
posited him on the floor of the 
room. 

Staggering, Forrester growled, 
“What’s urpnt?” 

“A hunting license has been 
taken out on you, Man Forres- 
ter. The licensee is Heinzlichen 
Jura de Syrtis Major, male, dip- 
ara-Zen, Utopian, eighty-six 
elapsed, six feet four inches im- 
port-export. He is extraterres- 
trial-human. No reason declared. 
Bonds and guaranties have been 
posted. Would you like your 
coffee now?” 

While the bed was speaking it 
had been rolling itself into a wall. 
It disappeared into a sphincter 
that closed and left no trace. It 
was disconcerting, but Forrester 
remembered Hara’s instructions, 
searched for and found his joy- 
maker, and said to it; “I would 
like my breakfast now. Ham and 
eggs. Toast and orange juice. 
Coffee, and a pack of cigar- 
ettes.” 

“They will be delivered in five 
minutes, Man Forrester,” said 
the joymaker. “May I give you 
the rest of your messages?” 

“Wait a minute. I thought it 
was the bed that was giving me

‘We are all the same, Man 
Forrester. Your messages follow: 
Notice of personal visit: Taiko 
Hironibi will join you for break- 
fast. Dr. Hara has prescribed a 
euphoric in case of need, which 
will be delivered with your 
breakfast. Adne Bensen sends 
you a kiss. First Merchants Audit 
Be Trust invites your patronage. 
Society of Ancients states you 
have been approved for mem- 
bership and relocation benefits. 
Ziegler, Durant and Colfax, at- 
tornies — ” 

“You can skip the commer- 
cials. What was that about a 
hunting license?” 

“A hunting license has been 
taken out on you, Man Forres- 
ter. The licensee is Heinzlichen 
Jura de — ” 

“You said that. Wait a min- 
ute.” Forrester regarded his joy- 
maker thoughtfully. The prin- 
ciple of it was clear enough. It 
was a remote input-output sta- 
tion for a shared-time computer 
program, with certain attach- 
ments which functioned as 
pocket flask, first-aid kit, cos- 
metic bag and so on. It looked 
something like a mace, or a jes- 
ter’s scepter. Forrester told him- 
self that it was really no less 
natural to talk to something like 
a mace than it was to talk into 
something like a telephone. But 
at the other end of a telephone 
had been a human being ... or 



at least, he reminded himself, 
the taped voice of what at one 
time had been a human being 
. anyway, it didn’t feel nat- 
ural. He said guardedly: “I 

don’t understand all this. I don’t 
know who these people are who 
are calling me up, either.” 

“Man Forrester, the personal 
callers are as follows. Taiko Hir- 
onibi: Male, dendritic Confucian, 
Arcadian, fifty-one elapsed, six 
feet one inch, organizer, business 
political. He will bring his ow.n 
breakfast. Adne Bensen: Female, 
Universalist, Arcadian-trimmer, 
twenty-three declared, five feet 
seven inches, experiencer-homes- 
woman, no business stated. Her 
kiss follows.” 

Forrester did not know what 
to expect but was pleasantly 
ready for anything. 

What he got was indeed a kiss. 
It was disconcerting. No kissing 
lips were visible. There was a 
hint of perfumed breath, then a 
pressure on his lips — warm and 
soft, moist and sweet. 

Startled, he touched his 
mouth. “How the devil did you 
do that?” he shouted. 

“Sensory stimulation through 
the tactile net, Man Forrester. 
Will you receive Taiko Hiron- 
ibi?” 

“Well,” said Forrester, “frank- 
ly I don’t know. Oh, hell. I guess 
so. Send him in . Wait a min- 
ute. Shouldn’t I get dressed?” 



16 



GALAXY 



“Do you wish other rhjth'njj, 
Man Forrester?” 

“Don’t confuse me. Just nc-ld 
on a minute,” he said, rattled 
and angry. He thought for a 
minute. “I don’t know who this 
Hirowhatsis is — ” 

“Taiko Hironibi, Man For- 
rester. Male, dendritic Confuc- 
ian — ” 

“Cut that out!” Forrester was 
breathing hard. Abruptly the 
joymaker in his hand hissed and 
sprayed him with something that 
f( It damp for a second, then dis- 
sipated. 

Forrester felt himself relaxing. 

“Oh, God,” he said, “what do 
I care who he is? Go ahead. 
Send him in. And get a move on 
with my breakfast, will you?” 

tt'V/'ou’ll do!” cried Taiko 
Hironibi. “The greatest! 
What a cranial index! You look, 
cripes, I don’t know what to 
call it, you look like a brain. But 
a swinger.” 

Charles Forrester, gravely and 
cheerfully, indicated a seat with 
his hand. “Sit down. I don’t 
know what you want but I’m 
willing to talk about it.” He was 
pretty sure that the joymaker 
had given him some kind of a 
tranquilizer, but he didn’t mind. 
“Sit down, Taiko,” he said. 
“You’re the damnedest looking 
Japanese I ever saw.” 

“Really?” The man looked 



disconcerted. He also looked 
quite non- Japanese: crew-cut 

golden hair, blue eyes. “They 
change you around so,” he said 
apologetically. “Maybe I used to 
look different. Say! Did I get 
here first?” 

“You got here before my 
breakfast even.” 

“Great! That’s really great. 
Now, here’s the thing. We’re all 
messed up here, you have to 
get that straight right away. The 
people are .sheep. They know 
they’re being expropriated, but 
do they do anything about it? 
Sweat, no, they sit back and en- 
joy it. That’s what we’re for m 
the Ned Lud Society. I lon’t 
know your politics, Charley — ” 

“I used to be a Democrat, 
mostly.” 

“ — Well, you can forget that. 
It doesn’t matter. I’m registered 
Arcadian myself, of cour^, but 
a lot of guys are Trimmers, 
maybe — ” he winked — “maybe 
even something a little worse, 
you know? We’re all in this 
together. Affects everybody. If 
you raise your kids with ma- 
chines you’re bound to have ma- 
chine-lovers growing up, right? 
Now—” 

“Hey!” said Forrester, losking 
at his wall. At a point as near as 
he could remember just about 
where the bed had disappeared, 
a sphincter was opening again. 
It disgorged a table set for two. 



THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT

one side bearing his breakfast, 
the other a complete setting but 
no food. 

“Ah, breakfast,” said Taiko 
Hironibi. He opened a pouch in 
the kilt-like affair he wore and 
took out a small capped bowl, 
a plastic box which turned out 
to contain something like 
crackers and a globe which, 
squeezed, poured a hot, watery, 
greenish tea into the cup at ais 
place. “Care for a pickled 
plum?” he asked politely, re- 
moving the cap from the bowl. 

Forrester shook his head. 
Chairs had appeared beside the 
table, and he slid into the one 
placed before the ham and eggs. 

Next to the steaming plate was 
a small crystal tray containing 
a capsule and a scrap of golden 
paper on which was written ; 

I don’t know about that 
champagne wine. Take this if 
you have a hungover. 

Hara 

To the best of Forrester’s 
knowledge he didn’t have a hang- 
over, but the capsule looked 
too good to waste. He swallowed 
it with some of the orange juice 
and at once felt even more re- 
laxed. If that were possible. He 
felt positively affectionate to- 
ward the blond Japanese, now 
decorously nibbling at a dark, 
withered object. 



It crossed Forrester’s mind 
that the capsule, plus what the 
joymaker had sprayed him witli, 
might add up to something larg- 
er than he was ready for. He felt 
almost giddy. Better guard 
against that, he thought, and de- 
manded as unpleasantly as he 
could: “Who sent you here?” 

“Why — the contact was Adne 
Bensen.” 

“Don’t know her,” snapped 
Forrester, trying not to grin. 

“You don’t?” Taiko stopped 
eating, dismayed. “Sweat, man, 
she told me you’d be — ” 

“Doesn’t matter,” cried For- 
rester, and prepared for the kill- 
ing question he had been saving. 
“Just tell me this. What’s the 
advantage of my joining your 
society?” 

The blond man was clearly 
disgruntled. “Listen, I’m not 
begging you. We got something 
good here. You want in, come 
in. You want out, go.” 

“No, don’t give me an argu- 
ment. Just answer the question.” 
Forre,ster managed to light a cig- 
arette, puffed smoke in Taiko’s 
face. “For instance,” he said, 
“would it be money that’s in- 
volved?” 

“Well, sure. Everybody needs 
money, right? But that’s not the 
only thing — ” 

Forrester said, politely but 
severely, restraining the impulse 
to giggle: “You know, I had an 



18 



GALAXY 



idea it would be like that. Well, 
thanks. You better be going 
now, Hironibi. I’ll think over 
what you said and maybe we 
can get together some time. But 
don’t you call me. Let me call 
you.” And he bowed Taiko to 
the door and watched it close 
behind him, face straight until 
the Japanese was gone. 

Then Forrester bent over and 
howled with laughter. “Come 
man!” he shouted. “Think I’m 
an easy mark!” 

“I do not understand, Man 
Forrester,” said the joymaker. 
“Are you addressing me?” 

“Not in this life,” Forrester 
told the machine, still chuck- 
ling. He might look like a coun- 
try cousin, but there was one 
sharper who had got no farther 
than first base. 

He wondered who this Adne 
Bensen was, who had fingered 
him for the swindler and sent 
him an electronic kiss. If she 
kissed in person like she kissed 
through sensory stimulation of 
the tactile net she might be 
worth knowing. And no problem, 
either. If Taiko was the worst 
this century could turn up, For- 
rester thought with pleasure and 
joy, his quarter of a million dol- 
lars was safe! 

'T'wenty minutes later he found 
his way to the street level 
of the building, not without ar- 



guments from this joymaker. 
“Man P’orrester,” it said, sound- 
ing almost aggrieved, “it is bet- 
ter to take a taxi! Do not walk. 
The guaranties do not apply to 
provocation and contributory 
neghgence.” 

“Shut up for a minute, will 
you?” Forrester managed to get 
the door open and looked out. 

The city of 2527 A.D. was very 
lafge, very fast-moving and very 
noisy. Forrester was standing in 
a sort of driveway, a clump of 
ethereal, thirty-foot-high ferns 
in front of him partially making 
a twelve-lane highway packed to 
its margins with high-speed 
traffic in both directions. Occas- 
ionally a vehicle would cut in 
to the entrance to his building, 
pause before him for a moment 
and then move on. Taxis? For- 
rester wondered. If so, he was 
giving them no encouragem^t. 

“Man Forrester,” said the joy- 
maker, “I have summoned 
death-reversal equipment but it 
will not arrive for several min- 
utes. I must warn you the costs 
may be challenged under the 
bonding regulations.” 

“Oh, shut up.” It seemed to 
be a warm day, and Forrester 
was perhaps still slightly befud- 
dled; the temptation to walk was 
irresistible. All questions could be 
deferred. Should be deferred, he 
told himself. Obviously his first 
task was to get himself oriented. 



THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT

And — he prided himself — he had 
been something of a cosmopoli- 
tan, back in those days before 
his death, as at home in San 
Francisco or Montreal as in New 
York or Chicago. And he had al- 
ways made time to stroll around 
a city 

He would .itroll this one now 
Joymakers be damned, thought 
Charles Forrester, right-faced, 
hooked the joymaker to his belt 
and set off along a narrow pe- 
destrian walk 

There were very few walkers 
It didn’t do to . lake snap judg- 
ments, Forrester thought, but 
these people seemed soft. Per- 
haps they could afford to be. No 
doubt someone like himself, he 
considered soberly, seemed like 
a hairy troglodyte, crude, savage 
and flint-axed. 

“Man Forrester,” cried the 
joymaker from his belt, “I must 
inform you that Heinzlichen 
Jura de Syrtis Major has waived 
protest of the bonding regula- 
tions. The death-reversal equip- 
ment is on its way.” He slapped 
it and it w'a^ quiet, or if it con- 
tinued to bleat at him it was 
drowned out by the sound of the 
clamoring traffic. Whatever 
drove these cars it was not gas- 
oline. There were no fumes. 
There was only a roar of air and 
singing tires, multiplied by hun- 
dreds and unending. The traffic- 
way lay between tall, bright 



buildings, one a soft, glowing 
orange, one the crystalline blue- 
gray coloi of fractured steel. In 
the court of a building across 
the trafficway he could see, 
dimly through the glass and the 
momentary gaps in the traffic, 
a dot of plant growth with 
enormous scarlet fruits On a 
balcony above him scented foun- 
tains played. 

The joymaker was addressing 
him again, but he could only 
catch art Oi it. “ — on station 
now, Man Forrester.” A shadow 
passed over him and he looked 
up. 

Overhead a white aircraft of 
some sort — it had no wings — was 
sliding diagonally down toward 
him. 

It bore a glittering ruby 
insigne like the serpent staff of 
Aesculapius on its sides. The 
nearer end of it was all glass 
and exposed, and inside a young 
woman in crisply tailored blue 
was drowsily watching something 
on a screen invisible to Forrester. 
She looked up, gazed at him, 
spoke into a microphone, glanced 
at him again and went back to 
watching her screen. The vehicle 
took position over his head and 
waited, following with him as ne 
walked. 

“That’s funny,” said Forrester 
aloud. 

“It’s a funny world,” said 
somebody quite near him. 



20

T Te turned around. Four men 
-*■ -*■ were standing there, looking 
at him with pleasant, open ex- 
pressions. One of them was very 
tall and very heavy. In fact, he 
was gross. He leaned on a cane, 
studying Forrester, his expres- 
sion alert and interested. 

Forrester realized that he was 
the one who had spoken and, 
in the same moment, realized 
that he knew him. “Oh, sure,” he 
said. “The Martian in orange 
tights.” 

“Very good,” said the Mar- 
tian, nodding. He was not in or- 
ange tightr now; he wore a loose 
white tunic and slate-gray shorts. 
He wasn’t really a Martian, 
Forrester remembered; at least, 
his ancestors had come from 
Earth. 

One of the other men took 
Forrester’s hand and shook it. 
“You’re the one with a quarter 
of a million dollars,” he said. 
“Look me up when this is all 
over. I’d like to know what a 
fellow like you thinks of our 
world.” 

He brought his knee up and 
kicked Forrester in the groin. 
Hard. 

Forrester felt the world ex- 
plode, starting inside him. He 
saw that the man was stepping 
back, looking at him with inter- 
est and pleasure; but it was hard 
to watch him because the city 
was moving. It tilted up at an 



angle and the sidewalk struck 
him on the forehead. He rolled, 
clutching at his testicles, and 
found himself looking upward. 

The man from Mars said con- 
versationally, “Don’t hurry. 
Plenty of time for everybody.” 
He lifted his cane and limped 
forward. It was quite an effort 
for him in Earth’s gravity, after 
Mars, Forrester saw. The cane 
came down on his shoulder and 
upper arm, was lifted and came 
down again, regularly, slowly 
and strongly. It must have been 
weighted. It felt like a baseball 
bat. 

The pain in Forrester’s gut was 
like death. His arm was numb. 

All in all, though, he realized 
quite clearly — unable to move, 
watching as they passed the cane 
from hand to hand and the white 
aircraft hovered overhead, the 
woman’s face peering patiently 
dovm — all in all, it was hurting 
rather less than he might have 
expected. Perhaps it was Hara’s 
hungover medicine. Perhaps it 
was just shock. 

He tried to speak, but his 
lungs were not working. 

He saw that someone was run- 
ning toward them, someone with 
a black face under a green beret, 
but he could not keep his eyes 
open. 

He could not quite lose con- 
sciousness either, though he 
wanted to very much. Perhaps 



THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



21 



that was Hara’s euphoric pill too. 
Then he felt that he was suc- 
ceeding. The pain in his belly 
grew/ alarmingly, and began to 
recede again, and then felt 
nothing at all, or nothing phys- 
ical. 

But there was something pain- 
ful in his mind, something th.at 
whimpered. Why? Why me? 

Ill 

TTowls of laughter rolled over 
Forrester. A girl was scream- 
ing, “He’s spinning it! He’s spin- 
ning it! Gee. I think I saw the 
cartridge!” 

Forrester opened his eyes. He 
was in something that lurched 
and hummed. A girl in a tailored 
blue suit, her back to him, was 
staring at what seemed to be a 
window opening on a sort of are- 
na, where the screaming girl, face 
flushed and happy, stamping 
with excitement, was standing 
over a blindfolded man with a 
gun. 

Forrester’s aches and bruises 
reminded him at once of what 
had happened. He was surprised 
that he was still alive. He croak- 
ed, “Hey!” 

The girl in the tailored blue 
looked over her shoulder at him. 
“You’re all right,” she said. “Just 
take it easy. We’ll be there in a 
minute.” 

“Where?” 



Impatiently she moved her 
hand. The arena with the man 
and girl disappeared — just as 
the man seemed to be raising the 
gun — and Forrester found him- 
self looking at blue sky and 
.iouds “Lift up a little,” the girl 
in blue said. “You’ll see it. 
There.” 

Forrester tried to raise himself 
on an elbow, caught a glimpse of 
trees and rambling pastel build- 
ings and fell back. “I can’t lift 
myself up! Damn it, I’ve been 
half killed.” He became aware 
that he was on a sort of stretcher, 
and that there was another one 
beside him. The other one was 
also occupied, by someone with 
a sheet over him. “Who’s that?” 
he cried. 

“How would I know? I just 
bring them in, I don’t write their 
life stories. Now relax or I’ll have 
to put you to sleep.” 

“You silly bitch,” said Forrest- 
er precisely. “I’m not going to 
stand for this. I demand that 
you — Wait a minute! What are 
you doing?” 

The girl had turned around, 
and she was holding something 
very like his joymaker, pointed 
at him. “Are you going to shut 
up and lie still?” 

“I warn you! Don’t you dare!” 

She sighed and something cool 
touched his face. 

Forrester gathered all his 
strength to tell her what he 



22 



GALAXY 



thought of her, her probable sex 
life and this world of hers, in 
which arbitrary and unpleasant 
things were done to well to do 
men like himself. He couldn’t. All 
that came out was, “Arr, a-r-r-r.” 
He was not unconscious, but he 
was very weak. 

The girl said, “You weep me, 
greenie. You are a greenhorn, 
aren’t you? I can always tell. 
You people wake up in the dor- 
mer and you tliink you’re God’s 
own sweat. Mother! Sure you’re 
alive. Sure you’ve had the biggest 
break you can imagine. But do 
you think we care?” 

All this time the aircraft was 
slipping and turning, coming in 
for a landing. The girl, who one 
would have thought to be the 
pilot, paid no attention. She was 
very cross. She said, “Now, I 
know my job, and my job is to 
keep you alive, or keep you 
safely dead till they can take 
care of you. I don’t have to talk 
to you.” 

Forrester said, “A-r-r-r.” 

“I don’t even like you,” she 
said with vexation, “and you’ve 
made me miss my favorite pro- 
gram. Oh, go to sleep.” 

And she raised the joymaker 
again, just as Forrester felt the 
aircraft touch ground, and he did. 

^ t the temperature of liquid 
helium chemistry stops. 

On this fact, and one reason- 



able hope, the largest industry 
of the late twentieth century had 
been built. 

The reasonable hope was that 
the progress of medicine in past 
years would be matched by simi- 
lar progress in the future — so 
that no matter what a person 
might die of, at some future time 
a way would be found to cure it, 
to repair it, or at least to make 
it irrelevant to continuing life 
and activity. (Including a meth- 
od of repairing the damage due 
to freezing to that temperature.) 

The fact was that freezing 
stopped time. 

And the industry was Immor- 
tality, Inc. 

In the city of Shoggo in which 
Forrester had awakened, a city 
which was nearly nine hundred 
years old and enormous, a thou- 
sand acres of park along a lake- 
front had humped themselves 
into a hill. All around was flat. 
The hill itself was an artifact. 
It was, as a matter of fact, the 
freezing center for that part of 
the world. 

A hundred and fifty million 
cubic yards of earth had been 
eaten out of the ground to make 
a cold-storage locker for people. 
When the locker was built, most 
of the dirt was heaped back on 
top of it for insulation. 

The differential in temperature 
between ground level and the 
heart of the frozen hill was near- 



THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



23 



ly five hundred degrees, Fahren- 
heit, or three hundred and more 
in the Kelvin scale on which the 
dormer operated. 

When Forrester realized where 
the white aircraft had taken him 
he was instantly submerged in a 
terror he could not express. Be- 
ginning to awaken, he was still 
terribly weak, as though one of 
those sprays from the girl’s joy- 
maker had shorted out ninety per 
cent of his volitional muscle con- 
trol. (As in fact it had) He saw 
the bright featureless ceiling ov- 
erhead and heard the moan and 
click of the thousand frightening 
instruments that brought people 
back to life, and fugued into a 
terrifying certainty that they 
were going to freeze him again. 
He lay there, groaning inarticu- 
lately, while things were done to 
him. 

But they were not freezing 
him. 

They were just patching him 
up. The blood was washed away. 
The bruises were scrubbed with 
something metallic, then touched 
with a transparent stiff jelly in 
a long silvery tube that looked 
something like a large lipstick. 
His left thigh was pressed for a 
moment between two glowing 
screens which he knew to be a 
sort of X-ray, and a fine wash 
of something that glistened wet 
and dark was painted over his 
heart. 



This last thing made him feel 
better, whatever it was. He found 
that he was able to speak. 

“Thank you,” he said. 

The young-looking, red-faced 
man who was working over him 
at that moment nodded casual- 
ly, touched Forrester’s navel with 
the end of a silvery probe, 
glanced at it and said, “All right, 
I guess we’re through with you. 
Get up and let’s see if you can 
walk to Hara’s office.” 

Forrester swung his legs out 
of the sort of low-walled crib he 
was in and found he could walk 
as well as ever. Even his bruises 
didn’t hurt, or not much, al- 
though already he could detect 
what seemed to be the beginning 
return of pain. 

The red-faced man said, 
“You’re fine. Stay out of here for 
a while, will you? And don’t for- 
get to see Hara, because you’re 
in some kind of trouble.” He 
turned away as Forrester started 
to ask questions. “How would 
I know what kind? Just go see 
Hara.” 

A slim green arrowhead skip- 
ped along the floor ahead 
of him, guiding him to Hara’s of- 
fice, but actually Forrester 
thought he could have found it 
without the guide that had been 
provided. Once he left the emer- 
gency rooms he was in the part 
of the dormer he remembered.

Here he had wakened out of a 
frozen sleep that lasted half 
a milennium. There he had gone 
every day for a week for bath- 
ing in some sort of light, warm 
oil that had vibrated and tingled, 
and made him feel drowsy but 
stronger each day. It was on the 
level below this that he had done 
his exercises, and in the building 
across the bed of poinsettias (ex- 
cept that these poinsettias were 
bright gold) that he had slept. 

He wondered what had be- 
come of the rest of what he 
thought of as his graduating class. 
The thawed Lazaruses were pro- 
cessed in batches — fifty at a 
clip, at least in his group — and 
although he had not spent much 



time with any of them there was 
something about this shared ex- 
perience that had made him 
know them quickly. 

But when they were discharg- 
ed they all went in separate direc- 
tions, apparently for policy rea- 
sons. Forrester regretted they had 
lost touch. 

Then he laughed out loud. A 
blue-jacketed woman, walking 
toward him along the haU and 
talking into an instrument on 
her wrist, looked up at him with 
curiosity and faint contempt. 
“Sorry,” he said to her, still 
chuckling, as the green beacon 
of light turned a corner and he 
followed He didn’t doubt he 
looked peculiar. He felt peculiar. 



THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT

He was missing these fellow- 
graduates of the freezatorium 
with the fond, distant detach- 
ment of his high-school class. Yet 
it was less than forty-eight hours 
since he had been with them. 

A busy forty-eight hours, he 
thought. A bit frightening, too. 
Even wealth was not as secure a 
buffer against this world as he 
had thought. 

The flickering green light led 
him into Hara’s office and disap- 
peared. 

Hara was standing at the door, 
waiting for him. “Damned 
kamikaze,” he said amiably, 
“can’t I trust you out of my sight 
for a minute?” 

Forrester, who had never been 
a demonstrative man, seized his 
hand and shook it. “Jesus, I’m 
glad to see you! I’m mixed up. I 
don’t know what the hell is go- 
ing on, and — ” 

“Just stay out of trouble, will 
you? Sit down.” Hara made a 
seat come out of the wall, and 
a bottle out of his desk. He 
thumbed the cork expertly and 
poured a drink for Forrester, say- 
ing, “I expected you under your 
own power this morning, you 
know. Not in a DR cart. Didn’t 
the center warn you somebody 
was after you?” 

“Positively not!” Forrester was 
both startled and indignant. 
“What do you mean, after me? I 
had no idea — ” 



Tlien tardily recollection dawn- 
ed. “Unless,” he finished thought- 
fully, “that’s what the joymaker 
was mumbling about. It was all 
about bonds and guaranties and 
somebody named Heinz-some- 
thing of Syrtis Major. That’s on 
Mars, isn’t it? Say.” Recognition 
hardily dawned. 

“Heinzlichen Jura de Syrtis 
Major,” Hara supplied, toasting 
Forrester with his glass and tak- 
ing a tiny sip of the drink. For- 
rester followed suit; it was cham- 
pagne. Hara sighed and said, “I 
don’t know, Charlie, but I don’t 
think I’ll acquire a taste for this 
stuff after all.” 

“Never mind that! The Mar- 
tian! The fellow in orange tights! 
He’s the one who beat me up, 
he and his gang!” 

Hara looked faintly puzzled. 
“Why, of course.” 

“And then,” said Forrester, 
working it out in his mind, “there 
was this colored fellow. I mean, 
Negro. I guess he was a Negro 
— Anyway, he came along.” 
“There was,” said Hara, “an- 
other man brought in. with you. 
Let’s see. Graphite-gray. Hair, 
black, kinked. Eyes brown. Is 
that what you mean?” 

“Sure. I think he was trying 
to help me.” 

“Oh,” Hara said, “there’s no 
doubt of that. Messed things up 
for fair, he did. He’s in the freez- 
er now. They killed him. Nitro-

gen batch — we’re just holding 
him until we get parts. There’s 
a compatibility problem, so it 
might be a week or two . 

“Killed him?” 

Forrester tipped up his ruby- 
crystal glass and drained the 
champagne — heaven knevi; where 
Hara had found it, after Forres- 
ter had mentioned it as one of 
the great goods of the past — 
and it was by no means appro- 
priate to the occasion. It tickled 
his nose. 

But at least it contained al- 
cohol, which Forrester felt he 
needed. 

He said humbly, “Please ex- 
plain what happened.” 

“Sweat, Charles, where do I 
start? What did you do to Hen- 
zie?” 

“Nothing! I mean — well, 
nothing, really. I might have 
stepped on his feet when we were 
dancing.” 

Hara said angrily, “A Mars- 
man? You stepped on his feet?" 

“What’s so bad about that? I 
mean, even if I did. I’m not sure 
I did. Would you blow your stack 
about something like that?” 

“Mars isn’t Shoggo,” Hara 
said patiently, “and anyway, 
maybe I would. Depends. Did 
you read your orientation book?” 

“Huh?”' 

“The book of information 
about the year 2527. You got it 
when you were discharged here.” 



Forrester searc’ned his mem- 
ory. “Oh, that. Maybe I left it 
at the party.” 

“Well, that computes,” Hara 
said with some disgust. “I mean 
figures. I’ll see you get another 
one. Meanwhile, will you please 
try to bear in mind, first, that 
you’re sort of my responsibility, 
second, that you don’t know your 
way around? I’ll see you get an- 
other copy of the book. Read 
it! Come back and see me tomor- 
row; I’ve got work to do now. 
On your way out stop at the 
discharge office and pick up your 
stuff.” 

He escorted Forrester to the 
door, turned, then paused. 

“Oh. Adne Bensen sends re- 
gards. Nice girl. She likes you,” 
he said, closed the door and was 
gone. 

F orrester completed his pro- 
cessing and was released by 
the medical section, receiving as 
he left a neat white folder with 
his name imprinted in gold. 

It contained four sets of docu- 
ments. One was a sheaf of medi- 
cal records, a second the book 
Hara had mentioned, slim and 
bronze-bound, with the title 
printed in luminous letters: 

Your Guide to the 26th Century 
(1970-1990 Edition) 

A third was what seemed to 



THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



27 



be a legal paper of some kind. 
At least, it was backed with a 
sheet of stiff blue material that 
gave it the look of a subpoena. 
Forrester remembered that the 
doctor who had patched him up 
had spoken of trouble. This look- 
ed like being the trouble, al- 
though the words were either un- 
familiar in context or totally 
meaningless ; 

You, Charles Dalgleish For- 
rester, uncommitted, undeclared, 
elapsed thirty-seven years, un- 
employed-pending, take greeting 
and are directed. Requirement; 

To be present at Congruency 
Hearing, hours 1075, days 15, 
months 9 — 

It had the authentic feel of 
legalese, he saw with dismay. 
Much of the face of the single 
sheet of paper the blue material 
enclosed was covered with a sort 
of angular, almost readable let- 
tering — something like the ma- 
chine script they used to put on 
checks, Forrester thought, and 
realized that that was no doubt 
what it was. 

But it had a date on it, and as 
that date appeared to be a week 
or more away, as near as For- 
rester could figure, he tabled it 
with some relief and turned to 
the next and last item in the 
folder. 

This was a financial statement. 
Attached to it was a crisp metal- 

28 



lie slip with the same angular 
printing on it, but which Forres- 
ter recognized as a check. 

He fingered it lovingly and 
puzzled out the amount. 

It was made out to him, and 
it was for $231,057.56. 

Forrester attempted to fold it 
— it sprang back like spring 
steel — and put it away flat in 
his pocket. It felt good there. 

He was faintly puzzled by the 
fact that it was some twenty 
thousand dollars less than he had 
expected. But in terms of per- 
centage the amount didn’t seem 
very significant, and he was 
cheerfully reconciled to the opin- 
ion that this society, like all so- 
cieties, would do doubt have 
some sort of taxes. Twenty grand 
was, after all, an amount he 
could well afford as a sort of 
initiation fee. 

Feeling much more secure, he 
emerged into the sunlight and 
looked about him. 

It was late afternoon. The sun 
was to his right. Slate-blue water 
stretched to his left. He was 
looking southward over the great 
pinnacled mass of the city. 

Aircraft moved above it. 
Things crawled ih its valleys. The 
sun picked out reflections from 
glass and metal and, although it 
was still daylight, the city was 
already exuding a building glow 
of neon and fluorescence. 

There were at least ten mil- 



GALAXY 



lion persons in Shoggo, Forrester 
knew. There were theaters and 
card parties and homes, places 
where he might find a friend or 
a lover. Or even an enemy. Down 
there was the girl who had kissed 

him last night — Tip and the 

Martian and his gang, who had 
tried to kill him. 

But where? 

Forrester did not now virhere 
to begin. 

Alive, healthy, with almost a 
quarter of a million dollars in his 
pocket, he felt out of things. 
Standing on a planet with a pop- 
ulation of seventeen billion ac- 
tive human beings, and at least 
twice that number dreaming in 
the slow cold of the helium 
baths, he felt entirely alone. 

F rom his belt the voice of the 
joymaker spoke up: 

“Man Forrester. Will you take 
your messages?” 

“Yes,” said Forrester, discon- 
certed. “No. Wait a minute.” 

He took the last cigarette out 
of the pack he had got that morn- 
ing, lit it, crumpled the pack 
and threw it away. He thought. 

Owning a joymaker was a little 
like having a genie with three 
wishes. The thing’s promptness 
and precision disconcerted him; 
he felt that it demanded equal 
certitude from himself and did 
not feel up to it. 

He grinned to himself ruefully, 



admitting that he was being mack 
self-conscious by what he knew 
really to be nothing but a radio 
connection with some distant 
lash-up of cold-state transistors 
and ferrite cores. He said finally; 

“Look. You. I think what I 
ought to do is go back to my 
room and start over again from 
home base. What’s the best way 
to get there?” 

“Man Forrester,” said the joy- 
maker, “the best way to get to 
the room you occupied is by cab, 
which I can summon for you. 
However, the room is no longer 
yours. Will you accept your mes- 
sages?” 

“No. Wait a minute! What do 
you mean, no longer mine? I 
didn’t check out.” 

But he paused and thought, 
and on consideration that didn’t 
seem to matter much. He had 
left nothing there. No bag, no 
baggage. No personal possessions, 
not even a shaving brush — he 
wouldn’t have to shave for a week 
or two anyway, Hara had told 
him. 

All that he had put of himself 
into that room was the garments 
he had worn last night. And 
those, he remembered, were dis- 
posable . and had therefore no 
doubt been disposed of. 

“What about the bill?” he ask- 
ed. 

“The charge was paid by the 
West Annex Discharge Center. 



THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT

it is entered on your financial 
statement, Man Forrester. Your 
messages include one urgent, two 
personal, one notice of legal, 
seven commercial — ” 

“I don’t want to hear right 
now. Wait a minute.” 

Once again Forrester tried to 
frame the right question. 

He abandoned the effort. 
Whatever his skills, he was not 
a computer programmer and it 
was no good trying to talk like 
one. It seemed absurd to ask a 
machine for value judgments, 
but — 

“Gripes,” he said, “tell me 
something. What would you do, 
right now, if you were me?” 
The joymaker answered with- 
out hesitation, as though that 
sort of question were coming up 
every day. “If I were you, Man 
Forrester, which is to say if I 
were human, just unfrozen, with- 
out accommodations, lacking ma- 
jor social contacts, unemployed, 
unskilled — ” 

“That’s the picture, all right,” 
Forrester agreed. “So answer the 
question.” Something was crawl- 
ing underfoot. He stepped aside, 
out of its way, a glittering metal 
thing. 

“I would go to a tea shop, Man 
Forrester. I would then read my 
orientation book while enjoying 
a light meal. I would then think 
things over. I would then — ” 
“That’s far enough.” 



The metal thing, apparently 
espying Forrester’s discarded 
cigarette pack, scuttled over to 
it and gobbled it down. Forres- 
ter watched it for a second, then 
nodded. 

“You’ve got some idea, ma- 
chine,” he said. “Take me to a 
tea shop!” 

IV 

'T^he joymaker procured a cab 
for Forrester — a wingless 
vehicle like the death-reversal 
equipment that had brought him 
in for repair, but orange and 
black instead of white; it looked 
like Hallowe’en. And the cab took 
him to the joy maker’s recommen- 
dation for a tea shop. 

The shop was curious. It was 
located in an interior hall of a 
great, spidery building in the 
heart of the city. The cab flew 
in under a pierced-steel buttress, 
actually into a sort of vaulted 
opening at least fifty feet above 
ground. 

It halted and hovered be- 
fore a baleony planted with 
elimbing roses, and Forrester had 
to step over a knife-edge of emp- 
ty space. The cab did not quiver, 
not even when his weight left 
it. 

A girl with hair like transparent 
cellophane greeted him. “I have 
your reservation, Man Forres- 
ter. Will you follow me, please?” 



30 



GALAXY 



He did, walking behind her 
across a quartz-pebbled court 
and into the hall that w/as the 
tea room, admiring the swing of 
her hips and wondering just what 
it was that she did to her hair 
to make it stand out like a sculp- 
tured puffball and rob it of opaci- 
ty- 

She seated him beside a reflect- 
ing pool, with silvery fish swim- 
ming slowly about. Even with 
the peculiar hairdo, she was a 
pretty girl. She had dimples and 
dark, amused eyes. 

He said, “i don’t know what 
I want, actually. Anyway, who 
do I order from?” 

“We are all the same, Man 
Forrester,” she said. “May I 
choose for you? Some tea and 
cakes?” 

Numbly he nodded turned and 
as she turned and left watched 
the sway of her hips with an- 
tirely different kind of interest. 

He sighed. This was a confus- 
ing world! 

TTe took the book out of the 
^ folder he had been given 
at the West Annex Discharge 
Center and placed it on the 
table. Its cover was simple and 
direct: 

Your Guide to the 26th Century 
(1907-1990 Edition) 

— Where to Go 
— How to Live 



— Managing Your Money 
• — Laws, Customs, Folkways 

It was edge-indexed with help- 
ful headings: Making Friends; 
Living on a Budget; How to Get 
the Most Out of Your Toymaker; 
Job Opportunities; Where to Get 
Needed Training . it went on 
and on. Forrester, flipping 
through the pages, was aston- 
ished to find how many of them 
there were. 

He had a good week’s rea.iing 
here, he estimated. Obviously 
the first thing to do was for liim 
to decide what was the first thing 
to do. 

Making friends could wait a 
bit. He seemed already to have 
made more friends — and ene- 
mies! — than he could assimilate. 

Living on a budget? He smiled 
to himself and patted the pocket 
that held his check. 

How to get the most out of your 
joymaker, though. That was a 
good place to start, thought For- 
rester, opened the book to the 
right page and began to read. 

The remote-access computer 
transponder called the “joymak- 
er” is your most valuable single 
possession in your new life. If 
you can imagine a combination 
of telephone, credit card, alarm 
clock, pocket bar, reference li- 
brary .and full-time secretary, 
you will have sketched some of 



THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



31 



the functions provided by your 
joymaker. 

Essentially it is a transponder 
connecting you with the central 
computing facilities of the city 
in which you reside on a shared- 
time self-programming basis. 
“Shared-time” means that many 
other joymakers use the same 
central computer — in Shoggo, 
something like ten million of 
them. If you go to another city 
your joymaker will continue to 
serve you, but it must be reset 
to a new frequency and pulse- 
code. This will be done auto- 
matically when you travel by 
public transportation. However, 
if you use private means, or if 
for any reason you spend any 
time in the agricultural areas, 
you must notify the joymaker of 
your intentions. It will Inform 
you of any steps you must take. 

“Self-programming” means 
that the programmed software 
includes — 

The self-programming, shared- 
time girl with the dark, grave 
eyes brought Forrester his tea 
and cakes. “Thank you,” he said, 
staring at her. He was still not 
quite sure of his deductions about 
her. He tried an experiment. 
“Can you give me my messages?” 
he asked. 

“Certainly, Man Forrester, if 
you wish,” she said promptly. 
“Alfred Guysman wishes to see 
you on political business. Rever- 
end Sam Tshumu wishes to see 



you on religious bus’iriess, but is 
at present not available and will 
contact you later. Adne Bensen 
asks you to return her mes.sage 
of this morning. The Nineteenth 
Chromatic Trust informs you 
that arrangements have been 
made for you to establish bank- 
ing facilities with them — ” 
“That’s enough,” he said, tnur- 
velling at how nicely a shared- 
time transponder could be pack- 
aged. “I’ll take the rest later.” 
There was no sugar for the 
tea, but it was physically hot and 
chemically cool at the same time 
— rather like a mentholated cig- 
arette, except that there was no 
particular taste associated with 
it. Forrester returned to his book. 

“Self-programming” means 
that the programmed software 
includes procedures for trans- 
lating most normal variations of 
voice, idiom, accent and other , 
variable modalities into a com- 
puter-oriented simscripl and 
thence to the mathematical ex- 
pressions on which the comput- 
ers operate. As long as your 
personal joymaker is within re- 
ception range of your voice you 
may communicate via other 
shared-time transponders if you 
wish. Appropriate modulation 
will be established automatically. 
However, do not attempt to use 
another individual’s joymaker 
when yours is not within range. 
Proper coding cannot be tissur-

ed. In the event that your joy- 
maker is lost or damaged — 

Forrester sighed and ate one 
of the cakes. It was rich with 
flavors like butter and cinna- 
mon and others he could not 
identify. Pleasant but strange. 

Very much like this world that 
had been given him. 

ttAyTan Forrester,” said the 
joymaker at his belt, its 
tones muffled by his coat and 
the tablecloth, “it is necessary 
for you to accept some messages. 
I have a notice of personal visit 
and — ” 

Forrester said, “Look, I’m do- 
ing what you said, right? I’m 
reading my book. Let me figure 
it out a little before you throw 
messages at me. Unless,” he said 
as an afterthought, “there’s 
something that’s life-and-death.” 
“There are no messages involv- 
ing life or death, Man Forrester.” 
“Then wait a while.” He was 
aware — he didn’t know how 
long it had been going on — 
that a distant wind instrument 
was hooting faintly. Pleasant but 
strange. Spiced cool breezes blew 
from the paneled wall^, also 
pleasant but strange. 

He said hesitantly, “Joymaker, 
answer me a question. Why did 
what’s-his-name, Heinzie, beat 
me up?” 

“I cannot identify the indiv- 



idual, Man Forrester. You were 
beaten up by four persons in 
the one recorded incident of at- 
tack. Their names were Shloino 
Cassavetes, Heinzlichen Jura de 
Syrtis Major, Edwardino — ” 
“That one. Heinzlichen Jura 
de Syrtis Major. Or, for that 
matter, all of them — why did 
they rumble me?” 

“I have a priority message re- 
garding Heinzlichen Jura de Syr- 
tis iviajOi', Man Forrester. Per- 
haps it will be informative. May 
1 give it to you?” 

“Oh, hell. Why not?” 
“Heinzlichen Jura de Syrtis 
Major is protesting enforcement 
of guaranties and has enjoyed 
disbursements under his bond. 
You are notified, Man Forrest- 
er.” 

Forrester said hotly, “That’s 
what you call informative? Look, 
skip the damned messages and 
answer the question. What was 
that scene all about?” 

“You have asked three ques- 
tions, Man Forrester. May I offer 
a synoptic reply?” 

“Please do, old friend.” 
“Heinzlichen Jura de Syrtis 
Major, a guest in the rep-rooms 
utilized by Alin Hara, conceived 
a grievance against you, cause 
unstated. Calling into association 
Shlomo Cassavetes, Edwardino 
Wry and Edwardeto Wry, they; 
formed an ad hoc club and filed 
appropriate conformance in re-

33 



gard to bonds and guaranties. 
The intention was stated as mur- 
der, first phase, ad lib. The mo- 
tivation was stated as grievance 
as to de Syrtis Major, practical 
joke as to the others. Conform- 
ances were recorded and the sub- 
ject, that is, yourself, Man For- 
rester, was notified. Does that 
answer your three questions, Man 
Forrester?’’ 

“What do you think?” Forres- 
ter snapped. “Well, maybe it 
does. Sort of. You mean those 
other three finks lumped me for 
a joke?” 

“They so stated, yes, Man For- 
rester.” 

“And they’re still running 
around loose?” 

“Do you wish me to ascertain 
their present whereabouts, Man 
Forrester?” 

“No, I mean, aren’t they in jail 
or something?” 

“No, Man Forrester.” 

Forrester said, “Joymaker, 
leave me alone for a while. I bet- 
ter get back to my orientation 
book. I see I don’t know as much 
as I thought I did.” 

Forrester drank the rest of his 
tea, ate the rest of his cakes and 
plowed back into his book. 

To use your joymaker as 
telephone: You must know the 
ortho-name and identification 
spectrum of the person you wish 
to reach. Once you have given 



this information to the joymak- 
er it will be remembered and 
you can then refer to the per- 
son in later calls by a reciprocal 
name or any other personal iden- 
tification programmed into your 
joymaker. If you have been 
called by any person, the joy- 
maker will have recorded the 
necessary ortho-name and iden- 
tification spectrum. Simply ask 
the joymaker to call the person 
you wish to speak to. If you 
wish to establish a priority rat- 
ing with any person, that person 
must so inform his joymaker. 
Otherwise your calls may be de- 
ferred or canceled as directed 
by the called person. 

To use your joymaker as cred- 
it card: You must know the 
institutional designation and ac- 
count spectrum — 

A belated thought percolated 
to the surface of Forres- 
ter’s mind. Messages. Financial 
institutions. One of the messages 
had been from something that 
sounded like that. 

He sighed and looked around 
the room. Most of the tables were 
empty. But it was a targe room, 
and there were perhaps fifty oth- 
er persons in it, all of them seat- 
ed at tables in twos and threes 
and larger groups. Through some 
effect of the sound-conditioning 
he could not hear their voices, 
only the distant hooting flute nnd 
a faint splashing from tl^c (p.int 
fish in the reflecting pools. 



34 



GALAXY 



He wondered if any of these 
fifty people would mind if he got 
up and walked over to them. 

Touching the faintly sore spots 
on his shoulders and neck, he de- 
cided against it. 

But it gave him an idea, and he 
turned to the section of the book 
on “Making Friends”. 

“I have an urgent notice of per- 
sonal visit, Man Forrester,” 
grumbled the joymaker from his 
waist. 

“Just save it,” said Forrester, 
preoccupied. He was startled at 
the length of the list of ways of 
making friends. Above all, there 
were clubs. Clubs in such pro- 
fusion that he wondered even 
seventeen billion people could 
fill their rolls. Social clubs, gym- 
nastic clubs, professional clubs. 
Political groups, religious groups, 
therapeutic groups. There was a 
Society of First Families of Mars, 
and a Loyal Order of Descen- 
dants of Barsoom Fans. There 
were forty-eight bird-watching 
groups in Shoggo alone. There 
were stamp-collectors and coin- 
collectors and tax-token collec- 
tors and jet-car transfer collec- 
tors. 

There was something called 
the Society of Ancients which 
looked interesting, as it appeared 
to be an organization of persons 
like Forrester himself, revived 
from the dead heart of the freez- 
ers. Yet it was listed with such 



curiosities as the B.P.O.E. and 
the Industrial Workers of the 
World (Memorial Association) in 
small type at the end of the sec- 
tion. 

Puzzling. If it existed at all, 
should it not have a member- 
ship in the billions? 

Evidently, it did not, but . 

“Man Forrester,” shrilled the 
joymaker, “I must inform you of 
personal visitation by — ” 

“Wait a minute,” said Forres- 
ter, suddenly looking up, startl- 
ed. 

There was a hint of perfume 
in the air. 

Forrester put down his book, 
frowning. 

The scent was familiar. What 
was it? Another tactile-tape mes- 
sage from this Adne Bensen, who- 
ever she might be? 

He felt a touch on his shoulder, 
then warm arms around him, a 
hug. 

These tactile tapes were cer- 
tainly convincing, he thought 
momentarily, then realized this 
was not a tape. He was not mere- 
ly feeling and smelling the pres- 
ence of the embracing arms. He 
saw them, from the corner of his 
eye, and awkwardly, like a wrest- 
ler struggling to break a hold, 
he turned inside them. 

He saw the face of the girl 
from the party, very near to his. 

“Tip!” he cried. “My God but 
I’m glad to see you!” 



THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



35 



TT^hen you came right down to 
it, Forrester hardly knew 
the girl, barring a little friendly 
kissing at a party, but at this 
moment she was very dear to 
him. It was like a chance meet- 
ing in Taiwan with somebody 
who sat at the far end of the 
commuter train for years. Not a 
friend. Hardly even an acquain- 
tance; but promoted by the acci- 
dent of unexpected meeting to 
the status of near and dear. He 
hugged her tight. She laughed 
breathlessly and shook free. 
“Dear Charles,” she gasped, 
“not so hard.” 

“I’m sorry.” He seated her and 
sank down opposite, admiring her 
dark hair and pale skin, her 
cheerful, pretty face and her fig- 
ure. The others in the tea room, 
some of whom had turned to 
look at them, were losing inter- 
est and returning to their own 
affairs. Forrester said, “It’s just 
that I’m so glad to see you. Tip,” 

She looked startled, then faint- 
ly reproving. “My name is Adne 
Bensen, dear Charles. Call me 
Adne.” 

“But last night Hara called 
you — oh!” he said, remember- 
ing. “Then you’re the girl who 
has been sending me the mes- 
sages.” 

She nodded! 

“Very nice messages they 
were,” he said. “Would you like 
some tea?” 



She said, “Oh, I think not. I 
mean, not here, anyway. I came 
to see if you’d like to come to 
my place for dinner.” 

"Yes!” 

She laughed, “You are such 
an impetuous man, Charles. Is 
that why they call you the kami- 
kaze people? I mean, your cen- 
tury and all.” 

“As to that, Adne, I don’t 
know,” he said, “because, when 
you come right down to it, I 
don’t know who calls me what. 
I am, you might say, confused. 
One of the many reasons why 
I am pleased to see you is that 
I need somebody to talk to.” 

She settled in a chair opposite 
him and took some tea, after all. 
It came without being asked for; 
apparently the joymaker had 
monitored their conversation and 
drawn the inferences any good 
waiter would draw. She threw 
back her filmy, puffy wrap — 
it had floated around her shoul- 
ders like a cloud, but it lay back 
against the chair quite incon- 
spicuously, Forrester noticed — 
and revealed a deep-cut, tight- 
fitting, flesh-colored vest or jer- 
kin of some sort that was start- 
ling at first. 

At second look it was still 
startling. 

She said, “Dear Charles. Don’t 
you ask your joymaker tilings!’” 

“I would except I don’t know 
what to ask.” 



36

*‘Oh, anything! What do you 
want? Have you filed a profile?” 
“I don’t think so.” 

“Oh, do! Then it will tell you 
what programs are on, what par- 
ties you will be welcomed at, 
who you would wish to know. 
It’s terrible to go on impulse, 
Charles,” she said earnestly. “Let 
the joymaker help you.” 

He discovered that his own tea 
cup had been replenished, and 
sipped it. “I don’t understand,” 
he said. “You mean I should let 
the joymaker decide what I’m 
going to do for fun?” 

“Of course. There’s so much. 
How could you know what you 
would like?” 

He shook his head. 

But that was all of that con- 
versation, all for then. His joy- 
maker said suddenly, its voice 
curiously tinny, “PRIORITY 
URGENT! THIS IS A DRILL! 
TAKE COVER! TAKE COVER! 
TAKE COVER!!” 

“Oh, dear,” said Adne, pouting. 
“Well let’s go.” 

“TAKE COVER!” blared the 
joymaker again, and Forrester 
discovered the reason for its 
metallic sound. Not only his but 
the girl’s, those of patrons at 
other tables, all the joymakers at 
once were repeating the same 
message. “TAKE COVER! 
COUNTDOWN STARTS NOW! 
ONE HUNDRED SECONDS. 
NINETY-NINE . .” 



“Where are you going?” For- 
rester asked, rising with her. 

“To the shelter, of course! 
Hurry it up, Charles, will you? 
I hate it when I’m out in a public 
place in one of these things.” 
“-NINETY-ONE. NINETY. 
EIGHTY-NINE—” 

He said, swallowing hard; “Air 
raid? A war?” 

She had his hand, tugging him 
along toward an exit at the rear 
of the tea room, where the other 
patrons were already beginning 
to stream out. “Not exactly, 
Charles dear. Don’t you know 
anything?” 

“Then what?” 

“Aliens. Monsters. That’s all. 
Now hurry, or we’ll never get a 
seat.” 

V 

A walk, an elevator ride, a short 
stretch through a light-walled 
corridor, and they came out into 
a great shadowy auditorium. 
There was just enough light to 
find their way to seats. It was 
filling rapidly, and behind them 
Forrester heard heavy doors 
slamming. 

When about three-quarters of 
the seats were filled a man in 
black climbed onto the stage and 
said, “Thank you all for your co- 
operation. I’m pleased to be able 
to tell you that this building has 
achieved four-nines compliance 



THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT

in exactly one hundred and forty- 
one seconds. 

There was a stir of interest 
from the audience. Forrester, 
craning his neck to find the source 
of the P.A. system — it seemed 
to murmur from all over the hall 
— located it at last as the man 
spoke again. It was his joymaker, 
and all the joymakers, repeating 
what the man said. 

“This is one of the best show- 
ings we’ve ever had,” he said 
warmly, “and I appreciate it. 
You may leave.” 

“You mean that’s all there is 
to it?” Forrester asked the girl. 

“That’s all. Are you coming 
up to my place?” 

He persisted, “But — if there’s 
going to be a raid, or any chance 
of one, shouldn’t we wait and 
see — ” 

“See what, Charles dear? 
There’s no need to grovel in the 
ground like moles. It’s just a 
test.” 

“Yes, but — ” He hesitated, 
and followed her out of the 
auditorium thoughtfully. 

It was confusing. No one had 
mentioned wat to him. 

But when he said as much to 
Adne, she laughed. “VFar? Oh, 
Charles! You’re so funny, you 
kamikazes! Now we’ve wasted 
enough time — are you coming 
to my place for dinner or not?” 

He sighed. 

“Oh, sure,” he said. 



I n the life that had begun with 
his birth in 1932 and ended 
with the inhalation of a lungful 
of flame thirty-seven years later, 
Forrester had been a successful, 
self-sufficient and substantial 
man. 

He had a wife — her name 
was Dorothy, small, blonde, a 
little younger than himself. He 
had three sons, and a job as copy 
chief of a technical writing ser- 
vice, and a reputation among his 
friends as a fine poker player 
and useful companion. 

Although he had missed par- 
ticipation in a war, he was a Boy 
Scout in World War II, partici- 
pating in scrap-metal drives and 
Slap the Jap waste fat collections. 
As a young adult he had lived 
through the H-bomb hysteria of 
the early fifties, when every city 
street blossomed out with signs 
directing the nearest way to a 
bomb shelter. He had seen enough 
movies and television shows to 
know what air raid drills meant. 

He was not very satisfied with 
the one he had seen. He tried to 
phrase his dissatisfaction to Adne 
as she changed clothes behind a 
screen, but she was not very in- 
terested. Drills were an annoy- 
ance to her, it was clear. 

She came out from behind 
the screen, wearing something 
filmy and pale, and not at all 
practical for cooking dinner. On 
tlie other hand, Forrester thought. 



38 



GALAX'V 



who knew how these people 
cooked their dinners? She rustled 
over to him, lifted his hand, 
kissed his fingers and sat down 
beside him, pulling her joy- 
maker from the place by the arm 
of the chair where she had left 
it: “Excuse me, Charles dear,” 
she said, and, to the joymaker; 
“Receiving messages.” 

Forrester could not hear what 
the joymaker said to her because 
she was holding it close to her 
ear and had evidently somehow 
turn^'d the volume down — ^which 
he resolved to learn how to do. 
But he heard what she said to it, 
though it was largely incompre- 
hensible: “Cancel. Hold Three. 
Comissary four, two as pro- 
grammed, two A-varied.” And, 
“That takes care of that,” she 
said to him. “Would you like a 
drink?” 

“All right.” She lifted glasses 
out of the well of the — Forrester 
would have called it a cocktail 
table, and perhaps it was. He 
noticed her eyes were on a stack 
of parcels on a low table across 
the room. “Excuse me,” she said, 
pouring a minty liquid for him 
and one for herself. “I just have 
to look at these things.” She took 
a small sip of her drink and 
crossed to the packages. 

Forrester decided he liked his 
drink, which was not sweet and 
made his nose tingle. “Been shop- 
ping?” he asked. Adne was taking 



out clothes, small packets which 
might have been cosmetics, some 
things like appliances. 

“Oh, no, Charles dear. It’s my 
job.” She was preoccupied with 
a soft, billowy green thing, strok- 
ing it against her cheek thought- 
fully. With a twist of her arms 
she threw it around her shoulders 
and it became a sort of Eliza- 
bethan ruff. “Like it, dear?” 
“Sure. I mean, I guess I do.” 
“It’s soft. Feel.” She drew it 
over his face. It felt like fur, 
though its points thrust out again 
immediately they left his skin, 
looking starched and throny. “Or 
this,” she said, taking it off and 
replacing it with what looked 
liked oiled silk in the box it came 
in, but on her shoulders dis- 
appeared entirely, except that it 
gave luster and color to her skin. 
“Or—” 

“They’re all beautiful,” he said. 
“What do you mean, it’s your 
job?” 

t tT’m a reacter,” she said proud- 
A ly. “Weighted nearly 50 mil- 
lion, with two-nines reliability.” 
“Which means?” 

“Oh, you know. If I like things, 
chances are ninety-nine out of a 
hundred that the others will too.” 
“Fifty million of them?” 

She nodded, flushed and 
pleased. 

“And this is how you make a 
living?” 



THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT

"It’s how I get rich,” she cor- 
rected him. “Say!” She looked at 
him thoughtfully, “I wonder . 
Do you have any idea how many 
others like you have come out 
of the dormers? Maybe you could 
get a job doing the same thing 
I could ask.” 

He patted her hand, indulgent 
and amused. “No. thanks,” he 
said, carefully not to mention the 
fact that he was rich — although, 
he remembered dimly, he had 
been far less reticent about it 
at the party the night before. 
Well, he had made a lot of mis- 
takes at the party — as witness 
his troubles with the Martian. 

“I never asked,” said Adne, 
putting the things away. “How 
did you die, Charles?” 

“Why,” he said, sitting down 
again and waiting for her to join 
him, “I died in a fire. As a matter 
of fact, I understand I was a 
hero.” 

“Really!” She was impressed. 

“I was a volunteer fireman, 
you know, and there was an 
apartment fire one night — it was 
January, witchy cold, if you stood 
still in the spill water you’d 
freeze to the ground in two 
minutes — and there was a child 
in the upper part of the building. 
And I was the nearest one to the 
ladder.” 

He sipped his drink, admiring 
its milky, golden color. “I forgot 
my Air-Pak,” he admitted. “The 



smoke got me. Or the combi- 
nation did — smoke and heat. And 
maybe booze, because I’d just 
come from a party. Hara said 1 
must have inhaled pure flame 
because my lungs were burnt. 
My face must have been, too, of 
course. ! mean, you wouldn’t 
know, but I don’t think I look 
quite the same as I used to. A 
little leaner now, and maybe a 
little younger. And I don’t think 
my eyes were quite as bright 
blue.” 

She giggled. “Hara can’t help 
editing. Most people don’t mind 
a tvw improvements.” 

Dinner had arrived as his 
breakfast had that morning, 
through a servadoor in the wall. 
Adne excused herself for a mo- 
ment while the table was setting 
up. 

She was gone more than a 
moment and came back looking 
amused. “That’s that,” she said 
without explaining. “Let’s eat.” 

/^f the foods served him For- 
rester was able to identify 
little or nothing. The textures 
were .sort of Oriental, with crisp 
things like water chestnuts and 
gummy things like sukiyaki vary- 
ing the crunch of lettuce and the 
plasticity of starches. The flavors 
were queer but palatable. 

“You must have been one of 
the first to be frozen,” she com- 
mented. “1969? That’s only a few 



40 



GALAXY 




years after the freezing began.” 
“First on the book,” he agreed. 
“It was because of the fire com- 
pany, I guess. I know they had 
the new death - reversal truck 
standing by for several months, 
waiting for a victim. I didn’t think 
I’d be the one to christen it. 

He ate a forkful of something 
like creamed onions in a pastry 
crust and said, “It must have 
been confusing for Dorothy.” 
“Your wife?” 

He nodded. “I wonder if there’s 
any way I can find out about her. 
What she did. How the children 
made out. She was young when 
I was killed — let’s see. Thirty- 
three, about. I don’t know if 
having a husband dead but frozen 

THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



would let her marry again . 
hope she did ... I mean — ” He 
broke off, wondering what he did 
mean. 

“Anyway,” he said “Kara had 
some records. She lived nearly 
fifty more years, died in her 
eighties of the third massive 
stroke. She’d been partly para- 
lyzed for some time.” He shook 
his head, trying to visualize small, 
blonde Dorothy as a bedridden, 
beldame. 

“Had enough?” asked Adne. 

He came back to present time, 
faintly startled. “Dinner? Why, 
I guess so. It was delicous.” She 
did something that caused the 
table to retract itself and stood 
up. “Come over here and have 

41 



your coffee. I ordered it specially 
for you. Would you like some 
music?” 

He started to say, “Not par- 
ticularly,” but she had already 
started some with visions of Bar- 
tok and music-concrete. But it 
turned out to be something very 
like violins, playing something 
very like detached, introspective 
T schaikowsky . 

She sank back against him, and 
she was very warm and fragrant. 
“We’ll have to find you a place 
to live,” she said. 

He put his arm around her. 
“This is a condominum build- 
ing,” she said thoughtfully, “but 
I think there might be something. 
Do you have any preferences?” 
“I don’t know enough to have 
preferences,” he said, caressing 
her soft hair. “In a place to live, 
anyway.” 

She said drowsily, “That’s 
nice.” And in the same tone, a 
moment later, “But I think I 
should warn you I’m natural- 
flow And this is about M-day 
minus four, so all I want is to be 
cuddled.” She yawned and 
touched her mouth with her 
hand. ‘Oh! Excuse me.” 

Then she caught a glimpse of 
his face. “You don’t mind, do 
you?” she asked sitting up. “I 
mean, i could take a pill — 
Charles, why are you that color?” 
“Nothing, Nothing at all!” 

She said apologetically, “I’m 
42 



sorry, but I don’t know much 
about kamikaze ways. If there’s 
a ritual tabu. I’m sorry.” 

“No tabu. Just a mi,sunder- 
standing.” He picked up his glass 
and held it to her. “Any more of 
this stuff around?” 

“Charles dear,” she said, 
stretching, “there’s all you want. 
And 1 have an idea.” 

“Shoot.” 

“I’m going to find you a place 
to live!” she cried. “You ju.st 
stay here. Order what you want.” 
She touched something that he 
could not see and added, “If you 
don’t know how, the children will 
show you while they’re keejjing 
you company.” 

What had seemed like a floor- 
length mural opened itself into 
a door. Forrester found himself 
looking into a bright gay room 
where two small children were 
racing each other around a sort 
of climbable maze. 

“We ate our dinner, Mim,” 
cried one of them, then saw For- 
rester and nudged the other. The 
two looked at him with calm 
appraisal. 

“You don’t mind this either, 
do you, Charles dear?” Adne 
asked. “That’s another thing 
about being natural-flow.” 

T here were two of them, a boy 
and a girl, about seven and 
five. Forrester guessed. They ac- 
cepted him without question. 

GALAXY 



Or not exactly that, thou^t 
Forreater ruefully. There were 
questions. 

“Charles! Did people really 
smell bad in the old days?” 

“Oh, Charles! You rode in 
automobiles?” 

“When the little children had 
to work in the coal mines, 
Charles, didn’t they get anything 
to eat?" 

“But what did they play with, 
Charles? Dolls that didn’t talk?” 

He tried his best to answer. 
“Well, the child-labor time was 
over when I lived, or almost. And 
dolls did talk, sort of. Not very 
intelligently . ” 

“When did you live, Charles?” 

“I was burned to death in 
1969 —” 

The little girl shrieked, “For 
witchcraft?” 

“Oh, no. No, that was hundreds 
of years earlier too.” Charles 
tried not to laugh. “You see, 
houses used to catch on fire those 
days — ” 

“The Shoggo fire!” shouted the 
boy. “Mrs. Leary’s cow and the 
earthquake!” 

“Well — something like that. 
Anyway, there were men whose 
job it was to put the fires out, 
and I was one of them. Only then 
I got caught and died there.” 

“Mim drowned once,” the little 
girl bragged. ‘“We haven’t died 
at all.” 

“You were sick once, though,” 
THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



said the boy seriously. “You 
could have died. I heard Mim 
talking to the medoc.” 

Forrester said, “Are you chil- 
dren in school?” 

They looked at him, then at 
each other. 

“I mean, are you old enough 
to start lessons?” 

The boy said, “Well, sure, 
Charles. Tunt ought to be doing 
hers right now, as a matter of 
fact.” 

“So should you! Mim said — ” 
“We have to be polite to guests. 
Tunt!” The boy said to Charles, 
“Is there anything we can get 
you? Something to eat? Drink? 
Watch a program? Sex - stini? 
Although I guess you ought to 
know,” he said apologetically, 
“that Mim’s natural-flow and — ” 
“Yes, yes, I know about that,” 
Forrester said hastily, and 
thought. Sweet God! 

But being in Rome, he thought, 
it was what the Romans did that 
counted, and he would do his 
best. He resolved it earnestly. 

It was like being at a party. 
You got there at ten o’clock, 
with your collar too tight and a 
little grouchy at being rushed and 
your starched shirt-front wet 
where the kids splashed it when 
you supervised their bedtime 
tooth-brushing. And your host 
was old Sam who’d been such a 
drag, and his wife Myra was in 
one of her nouveau-riche moods. 



43 



showing off the new dishmaker, 
and the conversation started out 
about politics, which was Sam’s 
most offensive side. 

But then you had the second 
drink: And then the third. Faces 
grew brighter. You began to feel 
more at ease. The whole bunch 
laughed at one of your jokes. The 
music on the stack of records 
changed to something you could 
dance to. You began to catch 
the rhythm of the party . 

Oh, I’ll try vowed Forrester, 
joining the children in a sort of 
board game played against their 
own joymakers. I’ll catch the 
mood of this age if it kills me. 
Again.

Y Tp betimes, and set out to con- 
quer a world. 

The home that Adne found for 
him was fascinating — walls that 
made closets as he needed them, 
windov/s that were not windows 
but something like television 
screens — Forrester resolutely 
spent no time exploring its mar- 
vels. After a disturbed night’s 
sleep he was up and out, testing 
his new world and learning to 
cope with it. The children were 
marvelous. He begged the loan 
of them from Adne and they 
were his guides. They took him 
to the offices of the Nineteenth 
Chromatic Trust where a portly 



old Ebent'zes Scsouge gravely ex- 
amined Forrester’s check, pains- 
takingly showed him how to draw 
against it, severely supervised his 
signing the necessary documents 
to open an account, and only at 
the end revealed himself by say- 
in, “Man Forrester, good day.” 
They took him to a Titanian 
restaurant for lunch, a lark for 
them, a shattering test of nerve 
to him, for the Titanians ate 
only live food and he was barely 
able to cope with an aspic that 
writhed and rustled on his spoon. 
They showed him their play- 
school, where for three hours a 
week they competed and jdotted 
with their peers (their lessons 
were learned at home, via their 
child-modified joymakers), and 
Forrester found himself playing 
London Bridge is Falling Down 
with fourteen children and one 
other adult, symbolically acting 
out the ritual murder and en- 
tombment in the bridge’s foun- 
dations that the nursery rhyme 
celebrated. They took him to 
where the poor people lived, 
with half-fearful giggles and in- 
junctions against speaking to any- 
one, and Forrester found himself 
out of pocket change, having 
given it all away to pale, mum- 
bling creatures with hard-luck 
stories about Sol-burn on Mer- 
cury and freezer insurance firms 
that had gone bankrupt. They 
took him to a park — indoors.

underground — where the land- 
scaping was topologically grotes- 
que and a purling stream flowed 
through a hill’s base and up the 
other side, and ducks and frogs 
and a feathery sort of Venusian 
fish ate morsels of food the chil- 
dren tossed them. They took him 
to a museum where animated, 
enlarged cells underwent mitosis 
with a plop like a cow lifting 
her foot from a bog, and a recre- 
ated Tyrannosaurus Rex coughed 
and barked and thumped its feet 
dangerously, its orange eyes 
glaring straight at Forrester. 
They showed him all their trea- 
sures and pleasures. But they 
did not show him a factory, or 
an office building, or a store of 
any size. For it did not seem that 
any of these existed any more. 
They showed him all of Shoggo 
until their joymakers chided 
them, and Forrester’s own said 
severely: “Man Forrester! The 
children must be returned for 
their naps. And you really must 
receive your messages.” 

The children looked at him 
with woe. “Ah, well,” said For- 
rester, “we’ll do it again another 
day. How do we get home from 
here?” 

“A cab,” said the girl doubt- 
fully, but the boy shouted: 

“Walk! We can walk! I know 
where we are. Ten minutes will 
do it. Ask your joymakers, if you 
don’t believe me.” 

THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



“I believe you,” said Forres- 
ter. 

“Then this way, Charles. 
Come on, Tunt.” And the boy led 
off between two towering build- 
ings, on the margin of a grassy 
strip where huge hovercraft 
swished by at enormous speeds. 

The joymaker complained, 
“Man Forrester, I have dicho- 
tomous instructions. Please re- 
solve them.” 

“Oh, God,” said Forrester, 
tired and irritable, “what’s your 
trouble now?” 

“You have instructed me to 
hold messages, but I have several 
which are high-priority and ur- 
gent. Please reaffirm holding or- 
der, stipulating a time limit if 
possible, or receive them now.” 

The boy giggled. “You know 
why, Charles?” he demanded. 
“It tickles them. It’s like if you 
have to go to the bathroom.” 

The joymaker said, “The an- 
alog is inexact, Man Forrester. 
However, please allow me to dis- 
charge my message load.” 

Forrester sighed and prepared 
to contemplate reality again. 
But something distracted him. 

Besides the steady whush, 
whush of the passing hovercraft, 
besides the distant chant of a 
choir — they were passing some 
sort of church — there was an- 
other sound. Forrester looked up. 

A faint tweeting sound of 
communications equipment was 

45 



coming from a white aircraa't, 
glass-fronted, hanging overhead. 
It bore the shining ruby cadu- 
ceus, and a dark-skinned man in 
blue was regarding Forrester 
gravely. 

Forrester swallowed. 

“Joymaker,” he demanded, “is 
that a death-reversal vehicle 
overhead?” 

“Yes, Man Forrester.” 

“Does that mean — ” He 
cleared his throat. “Does that 
mean that crazy Martian is after 
me again?” 

“Man Forrester,” said the joy- 
maker primly, “among your ur- 
gent priority messages is a legal 
notice. The twenty-four hour 
hold period having expired and 
appropriate notices and action 
having been filed and taken, the 
man Heinzlichen Jura de — ” 

“Cut it out! Is he after me?” 

“Man Forrester,” said the joy- 
maker, “yes. As of seventeen min- 
utes ago, the hold period having 
expired then, he is.” 

A t least the crazy Martian 
wasn’t in sight, thought 
Forrester, scanning the few visi- 
ble pedestrians. But the presence 
of the death-reversal aircraft was 
a poor omen. 

“Kids,” he said, “we got trou- 
bles. I’m being chased.” 

“Oh, Charles!” breathed the 
bojr, fascinated. “Will you get 
killed?” 



“Not if I can help it. Looh. 
Do you know any short-cuts 
from here? Any secret ways — 
through cellars, over rooftops, 
you know.” 

The boy looked at the girl. 
The girl’s eyes got very big. 

“Tunt,” she whispered. “Char- 
les wants to hide.” 

“That’s it,” said Forre,ster. 
“What about it, son? You must 
know some special way. Any kid 
would.” 

The boy said, “Charles. I know 
a way, all right. But are you 
sure — ” 

“I’m sure. I’m sure!” snapped 
Charles Forrester. “Come on! 
Where?” 

The boy surrendered. “Follow 
me. You too, Tunt.” 

They turned and dived into 
one of the buildings. Forrester 
took a last look around for Heinz- 
lichen whatever-his-name-was. 
He was not in sight. Only the 
hovercraft thrumming past, and 
the few uncaring pedestrians . 
and overhead the man in blue in 
the death-reversal vehicle, star- 
ing down at him, his expression 
both surprised and angry. 

X/^hen he was safely in the con- 
dominium building, the chil- 
dren returned to their own home 
to await the arrival of their moth- 
er, Forrester hurried to his 
apartment, closed the door and 
locked it.

“Joymaker,” he said, “you 
were right. I admit it. So now 
let’s have all those messages. 
And take it slow.” 

The joymaker said serenely, 
“Man Forrester, your messages 
follow. The Reverend Sam Tsh- 
umu asked you to call him, but 
he is no longer receiving mes- 
sages. Vincenzo d’ Angostura 

states that he is still available 
for legal representation but will 
not call again under Bar Associ- 
ation rules. Taiko Hironibi feels 
there was some misunderstand- 
ing and would like to discuss it 
with you. Adne Bensen sends 
you an embrace. A document 
package is in your receiving 
chute. Will you receive the em- 
brace?” 

"Hold it a minute. Gives me 
something to look forward to. 
Who’s this Reverend Sam Tsh- 
umu?” 

“Sam Tshumu: Male, Chris- 
tian entelechist, Utopian, five 
feet eight inches, proselytizer, 
business in regard to the assault 
on your person by Heinzlichen 
Jura de Syrtis Major.” 

“Well. All right. What about 
it? What does he have to say?” 
“I am sorry, Man Forrester. 
That ends the message.” 

“Can I call him back?” 

“No, Man Forrester. Reverend 
Sam Tshumu is at present in 
freeze due to injuries sustained 
at the same time.” 

THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



“That crazy Martian doesn’t 
waste time, does he? Well, what 
about the other stuff? Any of it 
important?” 

“As to that, Man Forrester, f 
have no parameters.” 

“You’re a big help,” said For- 
rester bitterly. “Get me a drink 
while I’m thinking. Uh, gin and 
tonic.” He waited for it to ap- 
pear and took a long pull. 

His nerves began to feel like 
tangled barbed-wire. “All right,” 
he said. “Now, what was that 
about a package?” 

“You have a document pack- 
age in our receiving chute, Man 
Forrester. Envelope. Approxi- 
mately nine centimeters by 25 
centimeters, less than one-half 
centimeter in thickness, weighing 
approximately eleven grams. In- 
scription; ‘Mr. Charles Dalgleish 
Forrester, Social Security Num- 
ber 145-10-3088, last address 
while living 252 Dulcimer Drive, 
Evanston, Illinois. Died of burns 
received 16 October 1969. To be 
delivered upon revival.’ Contents 
unknown.” 

“Hum. Is that all it says?” 

“No, Man Forrester. There are 
machinescript handling instruc- 
tions on the document. I will 
phonemize them as close as pos- 
sible; ‘Sigma triphase ooty-poot 
trip toe, baker tare sugar aleph, 
paraphase — ’ ” 

“Yeah, well, that’s enough of 
that. I mean, is there anything in 

47 



English? Anything T could under- 
stand?” 

“No, Man Forrester. Faint car- 
bonization marks are visible 
where the envelope has been 
creased. There are several minor 
discolorations which may repre- 
sent latent human skinprints. At 
some time a mild corrosive liquid 
was spilled — ” 

“Say, joymaker,” said Forres- 
ter, “I’ve got an idea. Why don’t 
I open it up? Where’d you say it 
was?” 

T3 etrieved from his receiving 
chute, the envelope turned 
out to be a letter from his wife. 

He stared at it and felt some- 
thing tingling in the corners of 
his eyes. The handwriting was 
very strange to him. The signa- 
ture was Still with atiection, 
Dorothy . .but the hand that 
had formed those letters scrawled 
and shook, and had even aban- 
doned her little finishing-school 
affectations of penmanship, the 
open-circle dots over the i’s, the 
flowing crosses on the f’s. He 
could read it only with difficulty. 

Dear Charles, 

This is, I think, the tenth or 
eleventh time I have written 
this letter to you. I seem to do it 
every time there is a death or 
bad news, as though the only 
gossip I have that is worth the 
effort to pass on for what may 

48 



be another century — or more 
■ — is that which has to do with 
troubles. Not your troubles, of 
course. Not any more. Usually 
the troubles are mine. 

Although t must say that real- 
ly my life has not been a burden 
to me. I remember that you 
made me happy, Charles. I must 
tell you that I missed you ter- 
ribly. But I must also tell you 
that I got over it. 

To begin with: You will want 
to know what you died of, I 
know, and perhaps the people 
who bring you back to life will 
not be able to tell you. (I am 
assuming that you will be 
brought back to life. I didn’t 
believe it at the time — but 
since then I’ve seen it happen.) 

You were burned to death in 
a house fire on Christie Street 
on October 16th, 1969. Dr. Ten 
Eyck, who was with the first 
aid squad, pronounced you dead 
and. with some difficulty, per- 
suaded them to use their death- 
reversal equipment to freeze 
you. There was some trouble 
about lacking glycerol for per- 
fusion, but the whole fire com- 
pany, you will be glad to know, 
dug into their liquor closets and 
came up with several bottles of 
bourbon . and it was that 
which was used as a buffer. (If 
you woke up with a hangover, 
you now know why!) 

There was some question as 
to whether too much time had 
elapsed, too. They thought you 
might have spoiled during (he 
discussion, you see. But as it 

GALAXY 



was cold weather for October 
they decided to take a chance, 
and you were ultimately con- 
signed to a freeze-dormer at 
liquid helium temperatures. 
Where, as 1 write this, you now 
lie . , . and where, or in one 
like it, I expect to be myself 
before long. 

I should tell you that I didn’t 
pay for any of this. Your fire 
company insurance, it turned 
out, was adequate to cover all 
I he costs and was in fact ear- 
marked for that purpose. If it 
harl been up to me 1 don’t think 
I would have gone to the ex- 
pen.se, Charles, because after all 
there were the children to raise. 

What can 1 tell you about 
them? They missed you very 
much. 

Vance, in particular, played 
truant from school for the best 
part of a month, forging notes 
to his teacher, persuading some 
adult — I .suspected our clean- 
ing woman at the time — to 
phone the principal to explain 
his absence, before 1 found out 
about it. But then he joined a 
Boy .Scout troop and, as they 
say, developed other interests. 

David didn’t say much. But I 
don’t think he ever got over it. 
At least not during his lifetime. 
He joined the Peace Corps four 
years later and was executed 
by insurgents during the Huk 
uprising in 1974. Since his body 
was mutilated before being 
found he could not be frozen. 
So he, at least, we will never 
see again. 

THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



Vance is now married, and is 
in fact a grandfather. It was his 
second marriage; the first was 
annulled. His present wife was a 
schoolteacher before their mar- 
riage . and they have been 
happy. And I really can think 
of nothing else to tell you about 
your son Vance that does not 
involve attempting to explain 
what broke up his first marriage 
and why his second wife could 
not stay in the United Slates 
1 suppose you may meet him 
some dav You can ask h-im 
yourself. 

Billy, you will be astonished 
to learn, is now a Great Man. 

Let me see. He was two wlieii 
you died. Now he’s our senator 
from Hawaii, and they say he 
will be president one day. But 
you will find out more about 
him in the history books than 
I can tell you, I think. Let me 
only say, what I know will in- 
terest you, that his first cam- 
paign was on a platform of free 
freezing for everyone, paid for 
out of Social Security funds, 
and you were mentioned in 
every speech. He won easily. 

And I , . am seventy-nine 

years old. 

Since you died forty years ago 
I cannot now remember you 
well enough, my Charles, to 
know if you will mind what 
I have to say next. Three years 
after your death I remarried. 
My husband — my other hus- 
band — was a doctor. Still is, 
though he is out of practice 
now. We have been very happy.

(oj. We had two other children. 
Both girls. You never met him, 
but he is a good man, barring 
the tact that at one time he 
drank too much. He gave it up. 
He looks a little like you . 

If I remember correctly, he 
does. 

And I am now in brittle 
health and this is the last time 
I will write you this letter. Per- 
haps we will meet again. I won- 
der what it will be like. 

Still with affection, 
Dorothy 

Forrester put down the letter 
and cried: “Joymaker! Was 

there ever a president named 
Forrester?” 

“President of what, Man For- 
rester?” 

“President of the United 
States!” 

“Which United States is that, 
Man Forrester?” 

“Oh, for God’s sakes! The 
United States of America. Wait 
a minute. First off, do you know 
the presidents of the United 
States of America?” 

“Yes, Man Forrester. Washing- 
ton, George. Adams, John. Jef- 
ferson, Thomas — ” 

“Later on! starting with the 
middle of the 20th century:” 
“Yes, Man Forrester. Truman, 
Harry S. Eisenhower, Dwight D. 
Kennedy — ” 

“Move it up! Start with around 
1990 .” 

50 



“Yes, Man Forrester. Williams, 
Harrison E. Kaapp, Leonard. 
Stanchion, Karen P. Forrester, 
Wilton N. Tschirky, Leon — ” 

“Well, my God,” said Forres- 
ter softly, and sat marveling 
while the joymaker droned on to 
the end of the twenty-first cen- 
tury, and stopped. 

Little two - year - old Willy. 
Baby Bill. A senator . and 
president. It was an unsettling 
idea. 

The joymaker said, “Man For- 
rester! Notice of physical visit. 
Adne Bensen is to see you, pur- 
pose unstated, time of arrival 
less than one minute.” 

“Oh,” said Forrester, “good. 
Let her right in.” And he re- 
hearsed what he would tell her, 
but not to any effect. Geneaol- 
ogy was not in her mind. She 
was angry. 

“You,” she cried, “what the 
sweat do you think you’re doing 
to my kids?” 

tt'll^hy, nothing. I don’t know 
what you’re talking 

about.” 

“Dog sweat!” The door 
crashed closed behind her. 
“Twitching kamikaze!” She flung 
her cape against the wall; it 
dropped to a chair and arranged 
itself in neat squares. “Pervert 
creep, you get a kick out of this, 
don’t you? Want to make my 
kids like you! Want to change 



GALAXY 



them into chatter-toothed hand- 
working dogsweaty cowardly — ” 
Forrester guided her to a chair. 
“Honey,” he said, attempting to 
get her a drink, “shut up a min- 
ute.” 

“Oh, sweet! Give me that — ” 
She quickly produced drinks for 
them, without a pause in her 
talking. “My kids! You want to 
ruin them!” 

“Look, I’m sorry, but I didn’t 
mean to get them in a danger- 
ous — ” 

“Dangerous! Go crawl! I’m not 
talking about danger.” 

“I didn’t let them get hurt — ” 
“Sweat!” 

“Well, it isn’t my fault if some 
crazy Martian — ” 

“Dog sweat!” She was wearing 
a skintight coverall which seemed 
to be made of parallel strands of 
fabric running top to bottom, 
held together God knew how; 
with every movement, as she 
turned, as her breast rose and 
fell, tiny slivers of skin showed 
disturbingly. “You’re not even 
a man. What do you know 
about — ” 

“I said I was sorry. Listen, I 
don’t know what I did wrong, but 
I’ll make it up to them.” 

She sneered. 

“No, I will! I know. There 
must be something they want. 
I’ve got plenty of money, so — ” 
“Charles, you’re pathetic! You 
haven’t got money enough to 

THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



feed a sick pup — or character 
enough to make him a dog. Go 
rot!” 

“Now, wait a minute! We’re 
not married. You can’t talk to 
me like that!” He got up and 
stood over her, the glass un- 
heeded in his hand. Now he was 
getting angry, too. He opened his 
mouth to speak, gesticulating. 

Six ounces of icy, sticky fluid 
slopped into her face. 

She stared up at him, and be- 
gan to laugh. 

“Oh, Charles!” She put down 
her own glass and tried to wipe 
her face. “You know you’re an 
idiot, don’t you?” But the way 
she said it was almost affection- 
ate. 

“I’m sorry,” he said. “Times, 
let’s see, times three, anyway. 
For spilling the drink on you, for 
getting the kids in trouble, for 
yelling back at you — ” 

She stood up and kissed him 
swiftly. As she reached up to 
him the strands of fabric parted 
provocatively. She disappeared 
into the protean cubicle of the 
lavatory. 

Forrester picked up the rest 
of his drink, drank it, drank hers 
and carefully ordered two more 
from the dispenser. His brows 
furrowed with thought. 

When she came back he said, 
“Honey, one thing. What did you 
mean when you said I didn’t 
have a lot of money?” 



51 



S he fluffed her hair, looking ab- 
stracted. 

He said persistently, “No, I 
mean it. I mean, I thought you 
knew Kara pretty well. He must 
have told you about me.” 

“Oh, yes. Of course.” 

“Well, then. I had this insur- 
ance thing when I died, see. 
They banked the money or some- 
thing, and it’s had six hundred 
years to grow. Like John Jones’s 
Dollar, if you know what that 
was. I didn’t have much to be- 
gin with, but by the time they 
took me out of the cooler it was 
over a quarter of a million dol- 
lars.” 

She picked up her new drink, 
hesitated, then took a drink of it. 
She said, “As a matter of fact, 
Charles dear, it was a lot more 
than that. Two million seven 
hundred thousand, Hara said. 
Didn’t you ever look at your 
statement?” 

Forrester stared. Two million 
sev — Two mill — 

“Oh, yes.” She nodded. “Look 
it up. You had the papers with 
you in the tea room yesterday.” 
“But — but Adne! Somebody 
must’ve — 1 mean, your kids were 
with me when I deposited the 
check! It was only two hundred 
and some thousand . .” 

“Dear Charles. Will you please 
look it up in your statement?” 
She stood up, looking somewhat 
annoyed and somewhat, he 



thought, embarrassed . 

where the devil did you put i?’ 
It was a silly joke anyway and 
I’m tired of it.” 

Numbly he stood up with her, 
numbly found the folder from 
the West Side Discharge Center 
and placed it in her hands What 
joke? If there was a joke, he 
didn’t know what it was. 

She fished out the sheaf of 
glossy sheets in the financial re- 
port, glanced at them, began 
handing them to him. The first 
was headed Cryotherapy, Main- 
tenance, Schedule /. It bore a 
list of charges under headings 
like Annual Rental, Biotesting, 
Cell Retrieval and Detoxifica- 
tion, as well as a dozen or more 
recurring items with names that 
meant nothing to him — Schlick- 
Tolhaus Procedures, Homiletic.s 
and so on. The second sheet bore 
a list of charges for what ap- 
peared to be financial servicing, 
presumably investing and super- 
vising his capital. The third was 
for diagnostic procedures, there 
were several for what seemed to 
be separate surgeries, sheets for 
nursing car and for pharmaceu- 
ticals used . there were in all 
nearly thirty sheets and the to- 
tals at the bottom of each of 
them were impressive, but the 
last sheet of all took Forrester’s 
breath away. 

It was a simple arithmetical 
statement ; 



52

Aggregate of converted as- 
sets $2,706,884.72 

Aggregate of Schedules 
1-27: $2,443,182.09 

Net due patient on dis- 
charge: $263,702.63 

Forrester gasped and coughed 
and cried, half strangled: “Two 
and a half million dollars for 

medical Sweet Jesus God!” 

He swallowed and looked up un- 
believingly. “Holy A.M.A.! Who 
can afford that kind of money?” 
Adne said, “Why, you can, for 
one. Otherwise you’d still be 
frozen.” 

“Christ! And — ” a thought 
struck him — “look at this! Even 
so they’re cheating me! It says 
two hundred and sixty thousand,, 
and they only gave me two thir- 
ty!” 

Adne was beginning to look 
faintly angry again. “Well, after 
all, Charles. You did go back 
there for extra treatment. You 
might get some of that back from 
Heinzie, I don’t know. Of course, 
he’s protesting it because you 
messed things up.” 

He looked at her blankly, then 
back at the statement. He 
groaned. 

“Reach me my drink,” he said, 
and took a long pull of it. He 
announced, “The whole thing’s 
crazy. Millions of dollars for 
doctors! People just can’t have 
that much money.” 

THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



“You did,” she pointed out. 
“Given time, people can. At 
compound interest, they can,” 
“But it’s — it’s — it’s medical 
profiteering! I don’t know what 
they did to me, but surely there 
should be some attempt to con- 
trol fees!” 

Adne took his arm and sat him 
down again on the couch beside 
her. She said with patience, but 
not very much patience, “Dear 
Charles, I wish you would learn 
a little something about the 
world before you tell us all 
what’s wrong with it. Do you 
know what they did to you?” 
He admitted, “Well — Not ex- 
actly, no. But I know something 
about what medical treatment 
costs.” He frowned. “Or used to, 
anyway. I suppose there’s infla- 
tion.” 

“I don’t think so. I — I think 
that’s the wrong word,” she said. 
“I mean, that means things cost 
more because the money is worth 
less, right? But that isn’t what 
happened. Those operations 
would have cost just as much 
in the nineteenth century, but — ” 
“Twentieth!” 

“Oh, what’s the difference? 
Twentieth, then. That is, they 
would have cost just as much if 
anybody had been able to do 
them. Of course, nobody was.” 
Forrester nodded unwillingly. 
“All right, I admit I’m alive and 
I shouldn’t kick. But still — ”

Impatiently the girl selected 
another document from the sheaf, 
glanced at it and handed it to 
him. Forrester looked, and was 
very nearly sick. Full color, near- 
ly life size, he thought at first 
that it was Lon Chaney made up 
as The Phantom of the Opera. 

But there was no makeup. It 
was a face Or what was left of 
one. 

■ He gagged. "What— What— ” 
“Do you see, Charles? You 
were in bad shape.” 

“Me?” 

“Oh, yes, dear. You really 
must read your report. See here. 
Evidently you fell forward into 
the flames. Besides being killed 
“the whole anterior section of the 
head was destroyed. At least, the 
soft parts. Mm — lucky your 
brains weren’t cooked, at that.” 
He saw with incredulity that this 
tender, charming girl was study- 
ing the photograph with as little 
passion as though the charred 
meat it represented were a lamb 
chop. She went on, “Didn’t you 
say you noticed your eyes were 
different? New eyes.” 

Forrester croaked, “Put that 
thing away.” 

He took a swallow of his drink, 
regretted it, fished out what re- 
mained of his second pack of 
cigarettes and lit one. “I see what 
you mean,” he said at last. 

“Do you? Good, deai. You 
know, I bet four or five hundred 

54 



people worked on you. All sorts 
of specialists. All their helpers. 
Using all their equipment. They 
get a case like yours, it’s like 
one of those great big enormous 
jigsaw puzzles. They have to put 
it all back together, piece by 
piece . only they don’t have 
all the pieces, so they have to 
get or make new ones . and of 
course the stuff spoils so. They 
have to — ” 

“Quit it!” 

"You’re awfully jumpy, Char- 
les.” 

“All right! I’m jumpy.” He 
took a deep drag on the ciga- 
rette and asked the question that 
had been developing in his mind 
for ten minutes now. “Look. At 
a normal rate of expenditure — 
oh, you know; the way you see 
me living — roughly how long is 
my quarter of a million dollars 
going to last?” 

She looked into space and 
tapped her teeth. “There are 
those custom items of yours,” she 
said thoughtfully. “They come 
high. Those things you smoke, 
and fowl eggs, and — what was 
that other thing? The oransh 
juice — ” 

“Leaving out that kind of 
stuff! How long?” 

She pursed her lips. “Well, it 
depends.” 

“Roughly! How long?” 

She said, “Well, maybe the 
rest of this week.” 



GALAXY 



T T e goggled at her. He re- 
pressed a laugh that sound- 
ed like a sob. 

The end of the week? 

He had been building himself 
up to an answer he wouldn’t like 
. but this exceeded his expec- 
tations. He said wretchedly, 
“Adne — what am I supposed to 
do?” 

“Well,” she said, “you could 
always get a job.” 

“Sure,” he said bitterly. “Got 
one up your sleeve? One that 
pays a million dollars a week?” 
To his surprise she took him 
half seriously. “Oh, Charles! Not 
that much. I mean, you’re not 
skilled. Twenty, twenty-five 
thousand a day — I don’t think 
you can really expect more than 
that.” 

He said, “You mean you can 
find me a job like that?” 

“Well, what do you think 
Taiko would have paid?” 

“Wait a minute! You mean 
Taiko would have given me a 
job? But I thought — I mean, he 
said it was his club — what did 
he call it, the Ned Lud So- 
ciety — ” 

“Yes, that’s right.” She nod- 
ded. “But he was quite aston- 
ished at the way you acted, 
Charles. I don’t know whether 
he’s angry or not.” 

“Man Forrester!” 

The sound of the joymaker 
was almost like an alarm, wak- 

THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



ening him from sleep. It took him 
a minute to realize what it was, 
emerging from his bemused state. 
Then he said, “In a minute, ma- 
chine. Adne, let me get this 
straight — ” 

But she was looking urgent 
and abashed. “Charles dear, 
you’d better take this message.” 
“Man Forrester! I have a 
priority notice of personal visit!” 
“Yeah, but, Adne—” 
“Charles,” she said, “please 
take it. Or never mind. I’ll tell 
you myself.” She looked down at 
her hands, avoiding his eyes. “I 
guess I should have told you be- 
fore. I think that’s Heinzie com- 
ing now.” 

“Heinzie? The Martian? The 
one — ” 

She said apologetically, “I told 
him to come, Charles dear. You’d 
really better let him in.” 

VII 

A s Forrester admitted the man 
named Heinzlichen Jura de 
Syrtis Major he was in the state 
described as “ready for any- 
thing”. What this actually means 
is that he was totally unready. 
He did not know what to expect. 
He could feel his heart pounding; 
he felt that his hands were be- 
ginning to shake. Even Adne 
seemed stimulated; she was 
watching them, her small face 
intensely interested, and she was 

55 



fumbling something out of her 
joymaker. A tranquilizer? No; 
more likely something to pep her 
up, thought Forrester. Whatever 
it was, she popped it in her 
mouth and swallowed before she 
said; “Hello, Heinzie. Come on 
in. I think you and Charles have 
met.” 

Forrester gave her a look, then 
returned to Heinzlichen. He 
started to put out his hand, then 
stopped, standing on the balls of 
his feet, half ready to shake 
hands, half in something like the 
attack position of karate. “We’ve 
met, all right. Too damned often.” 

Heinzlichen came in, allowed 
the door to close behind him, and 
stood still, studying Forrester like 
a specimen in a museum. Adne 
had been playing with the lights 
again, and mottled reds and yel- 
lows flecked his face. They fit 
his personal color scheme. He 
was a tall, fat man. His hair was 
red, and he wore a close-cut red 
beard that covered all of his face 
except for nose, lips and eyes, 
like the mask of a chimpanzee. 
He rubbed his beard thought- 
fully while he examined Forrest- 
er’s face attentively, glanced ap- 
praisingly at his arms and body, 
stared at the stance of his feet 
and finally nodded. He returned 
his gaze to Forrester’s chest and 
stabbed at it with a finger. He 
said, “Dat is where I will kill 
you. Dere. In de heart.” 

56 



Forrester exhaled sharply 
through his nose. It tingled. He 
felt the adrenalin flushing 
through his blood. He opened his 
mouth; but Adne cut in swiftly 
before he could speak: 

“Heinzie, dear! You prom- 
ised.” 

“Promised? What promised? 
I promised to talk, dat’s all. So 
let’s talk.” 

“But Charles doesn’t under- 
stand how things are, Heinzie, 
Sit down. Have a drink.” 

“Oh, sure I’ll have a drink. You 
pick me out something nice. But 
make it fast, because I only have 
a couple of minutes.” He re- 
turned to Forrester. “Well? You 
want to talk?” 

Forrester said belligerently, 
“You’re damned right I want to 
talk. And no, Adne, I don’t want 
a drink. Now, look here, you — ” 
he hesitated, finding it hard to 
think of the right thing to say — 
“well, what I want to know is, 
why the devil do you want to 
kill me?” 

The Martian looked baffled. 
He glanced at Adne helplessly, 
then returned to Forrester. 
“Sweat, I don’t know,” he said. 
“Up dere at de party you 
stomped my foot and all . 
but I guess I just don’t like you 
anyway. What do you want to 
ask a question like dat for?” 
“Why? It’s my life!” 

The Martian growled, “I knew 

GALAXY 



dis was a bad idea. Honey, I’m 
going. De more I see of dis guy, 
de less I like him.” 

But Adne had her hand on his 
ann. “Please, Heinzie. Here.” 
She handed him a fizzy orange 
drink in a thing like a brandy 
inhaler with a hollow stem. “You 
know Charles is just out of the 
sleep-freeze. He’s kind of a slow 
learner, I’m afraid.” 

“Dat’s his business. Killing 
him, dat’s my business.” But the 
Martian grumpily accepted the 
drink. The girl pressed her ad- 
vantage. 

“Yes, but, Heinzie, dear, what’s 
the fun of it if he doesn’t know 
what it’s all about?” 

“Trimmer,” Heinzlichen growl- 
ed. “Maybe it’s more fun dat 
way. I can’t help dinking we 
lose some of de important values 
when it’s all so cut and dried.” 
“All right, I-Ieinzie, maybe 
you’re right, but there’s such a 
thing as fair play, too. Why, I 
don’t even think Charles really 
knows what his rights are.” 

The Martian shook his head. 
“Dat’s not my business eider. 
Dere’s his joymaker; let him 
call up and find out.” 

Adne winked reassuringly at 
Forrester, who was not in the 
least reassured. But she seemed 
more confident and relaxed now. 
She leaned back, sipping her 
drink, and said silkily. “Wouldn’t 
it be nicer for you to talk to him 

THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



about it? Tell Charles what you 
want to do exactly?” 

“Oh, dat part’s all right.” The 
Martian put down his own drink, 
scratched his beard thoughtfully 
and said: “Well, it’s like dis. 1 
want to beat him up good, and 
den I will stomp on his chest 
cage until it breaks and ruptures 
de heart. De reason I like to do 
it dat way is it hurts a lot, and 
you don’t get near de brain. Of 
course,” he mused, “1 got to 
pay a little more, but de best 
pleasures are de ones you pay 
for. Cheap’s cheap.” Then his 
expression lightened — or seemed 
to ; the beard hid most of his 
transient looks. “Anyway,” he 
added, “maybe I can get off 
paying de bill. I talked to de 
lawyer and he said Forrester got 
himself in a jam wid de law when 
dis Oder fellow butted in, so may- 
be we can fight de costs. But dat 
doesn’t matter in de long run. 
What de hell, if it costs it costs.” 

S ^orrester nodded thoughtfully 
and sat down. “I believe I’ll 
have that drink now, Adne,” he 
said. He realized, with a certain 
amount of pride, that he was per- 
fectly calm. 

The reason was that Forrester 
had come to a decision v/hile 
Heinzlichen was talking: he had 
decided to go along with the gag. 
True, it v/asn’t really a gag. 
True, when this man said he in- 

57 



tended to cause Forrester a lot 
of pain and ultimate death, he 
meant every word of it. But you 
could not spend your life in 
weighing consequences. You had 
to pretend that the chips were 
only plastic and did not repre- 
sent real currency of any sort, 
otherwise you would lose the 
game out of nerves and panic. 

The very fact that the stakes 
were so important to Forrester 
was a good reason for pretend- 
ing they were only make-believe. 

lie accepted a glass from Adne 
and said reasonably, “Now, let’s 
get this straight. Did I under- 
stand you right? You talked to a 
lawyer before you tried to kill 
me?” 

■‘Neh! Wake up, will you? All 
I did den was file de papers.” 

“But you just said — ” 

“Listen, why don’t you? De 
paper,s was so I could kill you — 
all de usual stuff, bonds to cover 
de DR business, guaranties 
against damaging de brain and 
like dat. Den de lawyer was just 
yesterday, when I got de idea 
maybe I could kill you and save 
all de bond and guarantie 
money.” 

“Excuse me. I didn’t under- 
stand that part.” Forrester nod- 
ded pleasantly, tipped back his 
glass and swallowed it down. 
“Another please, Adne,” he said, 
thinking hard. 

It began to make a certain 
58 



amount of sense, he realized. The 
thing you had to remember was 
that to these people death was 
not a terminal act but only an 
intermission. 

He said, “As I understand it — 
I mean, if I understand it — the 
legal part of this business moans 
you have to guarantee to pay my 
freezer costs if you kill me.” 
“Nah! Not ‘if’. Odderwise you 
got it.” 

“So I don’t have anything to 
say about it. The lawyer lets you 
kill me and I’m stuck with it.” 
“Dat’s right.” 

Forrester said thoughtfully, 
“But it doesn’t sound fair to me, 
everything considered.” 

“Fair? Of course it’s fair! Dat’s 
de whole idea of de guaranties.” 
“Yes, of course — if the cir- 
cumstances are noinnal. But in 
this case, with death-reversal out 
of the question . .” 

The Martian snorted angrily. 
“Are you crazy?” 

“No, really,” Forrester per- 
sisted. “You said you were going 
to try to get out of paying my 
expenses. You know more about 
it than I do. Suppose you suc- 
ceed?” 

“Oh, boy! Den you have to 
pay dem yourself.” 

Forrester said politely, “But 
you see, I don’t have any money 
to pay them with. Ask Adne.” 
The Martian turned to Adne 
with a look of unbelieving anger, 

GALAXY 



but she said, “As a matter of 
fact, Heinzie, Charles is telling 
you the truth. I didn’t think of 
it, but it’s so. I mean, I haven’t 
checked his balance . but it 
can’t be much.” 

“De hell with his balance! 
What de sweat do I care about 
that I just want to kill him!” 
“You see. Jura, if you kill 
me — ” 

“Shut up, you!” 

“But the way things are — ” 
“Dogsweat!” The Martian’s 
face was working angrily under 
the mask of beard. He was con- 
fused, and mad about it. “What’s 
de matter with you, Forrester? 
Why didn’t you get a job?” 
“Well, I will. As soon as I 
can.” 

“Sweat! You want to chicken 
out, dat’s all!” 

“I simply didn’t understand 
my money situation. I didn’t plan 
it this way. I’m sorry. Jura, I 
really am, but — ” 

“Shut up!’ barked the Martian. 
“Look, I got no more time for 
dis talk. I have to go to de re- 
hearsal hall, we’re doing de 
Schumann lieder and I’m de 
soloist. Answer de question. Do 
you want to chicken out?” 

“Well,” said Forrester, fiddling 
with his glass and casting a side- 
long glance at Adne, “yes.” 
“Fink! Dogsweat fink!” 

“I knov7 how you feel. I guess 
I’d feel the same way.” 

THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



“De hell with how you’d feci. 
All right, look. I’m not promis- 
ing anything, but I’ll talk to de 
lawyer again and see where de 
hell we stand. Meanwhile, you 
get a job, hear?” 

F orrester showed the Martian 
out. He was feeling elated. 
He stood thoughtfully at the 
door, testing the feeling. For a 
man who had just discovered he 
was a pauper, who had reinforced 
the dislike of an enemy who pro- 
posed to kill him, Forrester was 
feeling pretty good. Probably it 
was all in an illusion, he thought 
fatalistically. 

Adne was curled up on the 
couch, study .ing him. She had 
been doing something with the 
lights again; now they were 
misty blue, and her skin gleamed 
through the lacy strands of her 
coverall. Perhaps she had been 
doing something with that, too; 
it seemed to be showing more of 
Adne than it had earlier. For- 
rester excused himself and went 
into the little lavatory room to 
splash cold water on his face: 
And then he realized the cause of 
his elation. 

He had managed to win a 
point. 

He was not a bit sure it was 
a worthwhile point; he wasn’t 
even quite sure of what he had 
won. But for better or for worse, 
he had won a small victory over 

59 



Heinzlichen Jura de Syrtis 
Major. For days Forrester had 
been a cork bobbing to the 
thrusts of every passerby; now 
he was thrusting back. He came 
smiling back into the room and 
cried: “I want a drink!” 

Adne was still on the couch, 
murmuring into her joymaker. 
“ — and be sure you’re locked 
up,” she was saying, “don’t for- 
get your prophylaxis and good 
night, Mim.” She put it down 
and looked up at him. Her ex- 
pression was sulky but enter- 
tained. 

“The kids?” She nodded. “My 
God, is it that late?” He had for- 
gotten the passage of time. “I’m 
sorry. I mean, what about their 
dinners and all?” 

She looked slightly less sulky, 
slightly more entertained. “Oh, 
Charles! You weren’t thinking I 
had to boil oatmeal or peel po- 
tatoes? They’ve had their din- 
ners, of course.” 

“Oh. Well. I guess we should 
be thinking about ours — ” 

“Not yet.” 

Forrester said, reorienting his 
thinking very quickly. “All right. 
Then what about that drink?” 
“I’m not thirsty, you fool.” 
She lifted her joymaker, looked 
him over with narrowed eyes, 
kissed the soft spot at the base 
of his throat and touched it with 
the joymaker. 

Forrester felt a sudden urge in- 



side him. It was like a mild elec- 
tric shock, like a whiff of mingled 
oxygen and musk. 

Adne studied him critically, 
then leaned forward and kissed 
him on the lips. 

A moment later he said, “Do 
that again.” 

She did. Then she lay back 
against him with her head on his 
shoulder. 

“Dear Charles,” she said, 
“you’re such a nut.” 

He stroked her and kissed her 
hair. The parallel-strand fabric 
did not feel coarse or wirey; lie 
could hardly tell it was there. 

“I don’t know if you did the 
right thing with Heinzie,” she 
said meditatively. “It’s kind of 
— you know. Almost chicken 
. .” Then she turned inside his 
arm and kissed his ear. “I know 
it embarrasses you when I talk 
biology, but — well, the reason 
I’m natural-flow, you see, is I’m 
a natural type of girl. Do you 
understand?” 

“Sure,” he lied, hardly even 
hearing her. 

“I mean, if you want to you 
can take the pills and use chem- 
osimulants and it’s just about the 
same. But I don’t do that, be- 
cause if you’re going to do that, 
you might just as well go all the 
way and use the joy machine.” 

“I can see that, all right,” he 
said, but she fended him off and 
added: 



60 



GALAXY 



"Slii’, one doesn’t have to be 
Cjinetimes you’re at a low 
point, and something special hap- ‘ 
pens and you’d like to be at a 
high point. Then you can take a 
pill if you want to, do you see?” 

“Oh, yes! Say!” said Forrester, 
pleasantly excited, “I wonder! 
How would you feel about taking 
a pill now?” 

She sat up, stretched and put 
her arms around him. “Don’t 
have to,” she said, resting her 
cheek against his. “I took one 
when you let Heinzie in.” 

■^J^ith two victories in one day, 
thought Forrester in a mood 
of pleasant triumph and lassi- 
tude, this world could come pret- 
ty close to his first hopes for it 
after all. After the girl had gone 
he slept for ten good hours, and 
woke with the conviction that 
everything would come out right. 
The father of a president and the 
lover of Adne Bensen was, at 
least in his own eyes, a figure of 
much mana. There were prob- 
lems. But he would cope with 
them. 

He ordered breakfast and add- 
ed: “Machine! How do I go 
about getting a job?” 

“If you will state parameters, 
Man Forrester, I will inform you 
as to openings which may be 
suitable.” 

“You mean what kind of job? 

I don’t know what kind. Just so 

THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



it pays — ” he coughed before he 
could get the figure out — “around 
ten million bucks a year.” 

But the joymaker took it in 
stride. “Yes, Man Forrester. 
Please inform me further as to 
working conditions — home or ex- 
ternal; mode of payment — 
straight cash or fringed; if fringe, 
nature permitted — profit-shar- 

ing, stock issue, allocated earn- 
ings bonus, or other; categories 
not to be considered; religious, 
moral or political objections, not 
stated in your record profile, 
which may debar classes of em- 
ploy—’ 

“Slow down a minute, ma- 
chine. Let me think.” 

“Certainly, Man Forrester. 
Will you receive your messages 
now?” 

“No. I mean,” he added cau- 
tiously, “not unless there are 
some life and death ones, like 
that Martian being out to kill me 
again.” But there weren’t. That, 
too, thought Forrester with pleas- 
ure, set this day off from other 
days. 

He ate thoughtfully and eco- 
nomically, bathed, put on clean 
clothes and allowed himself an 
extremely expensive cigarette be- 
fore he tackled the joymaker 
again. Then he said: “Tell you 
what you do, machine. Just give 
me an idea of what jobs are 
open.” 

“I cannot sort them unless you 

61 



give me parameters, Man For- 
rester.” 

“That’s right. Don’t sort them. 
Just give me an idea of what’s 
going.” 

“Very well, Man Forrester. I 
will give you direct crude read- 
out of new listings as received in 
real time. Marking. Mark! Item, 
curvilinear phase-analysis major, 
seventy-five hundred. Item, chef, 
full manual, cordon-bleu exper- 
ience, eighteen thousand. Item, 
poll subjects, detergents and 
stress-control appliance, no ex- 
perience required, six thousand. 
Item, child-care domestics — but, 
Man Forrester,” the joymaker 
broke in on itself, “that clearly 
specifies female employment. 
Shall I eliminate the obviously 
inappropriate listings?” 

“No. I mean, yes. Eliminate 
the whole thing for now. I get the 
idea.” But it was confusing, 
thought Forrester uncomforta- 
bly; the salaries mentioned were 
hardly higher than twentieth- 
century scales They would not 
support a Pekingese pup in this 
era of joyful extravagance. “I 
think ni go see Adne,” he said 
suddenly, and aloud. 

The joymaker chose to reply. 
“Very well, Man Forrester, but 
I must inform you as to a Class 
Gamma alert. Transit outside 
your own dwelling will be inter- 
rupted for drill purposes.” 

“Oh. God. An air raid?” 



“A drill, Man Forrester.” ' 
“Sure. Well, how long is that 
going to go on?” 

“Perhaps five minutes, Man 
Forrester.” 

“Oh, well, that’s not so bad. 
I tell you what, why don’t you 
give me my messages while I’m 
waiting.” 

“Yes, Man Forrester. There is 
one personal and nine commer- 
cial. The personal message is 
from Adne Bensen and follows.” 
Forrester felt the light touch of 
Adne’s hand, then the whisper of 
Adne’s voice: “Dear Charles,” 
her voice whispered, “see me 
again soon, you dragon! And 
you know we have to think about 
something, don’t you? We have 
to decide on a name.” 

VIII 

'^XT^hen he reached Adne’s 
^ apartment the children let 
him in. “Hello, Tunt,” he said. 
“Hello, Mim.” 

They stared at him curiously, 
then at each other. Blew it again, 
he thought in resignation; it must 
be the girl that’s Tunt, the boy 
that’s Mim. But he had long since 
decided that if he tried to track 
down all his little errors he would 
have time for nothing else, and 
he was determined not to be de- 
railed. “Where’s your mother?” 
he asked. 

“Out,” 



62 



GALAXY 



“Do you know where?” For- 
rester asked. 

“Uh-huh.” 

Forrester said patiently, 
“Would you like to tell me?” 

The boy and girl looked at 
each other thoughtfully. Then 
the boy said. “Well, not par- 
ticularly, Charles. We’re kind of 
busy.” 

Forrester had always thought 
of himself as a man who liked 
children but, although he smiled 
at these two, the smile was be- 
coming forced. “I guess I can 
call her up on the joymaker,” he 
said. 

The boy looked scandalized. 

"Now? While she’s crawling?” 

Forrester sighed. “Look, fel- 
lows, I want to talk to your 
mother about something. How do 
you recommend I go about it?” 

“You could wait here, I guess,” 
the boy said reluctantly. 

“If you have to,” added the 
girl. 

“I get the impression you don’t 
want me around. What are you 
kids doing?” 

“Well — ” the boy overruled 
his sister with a look and said 
sheepishly — “we’re having a 
meeting.” 

“But please don’t tell Taiko!” 
cried the girl. 

“He doesn’t like our club,” the 
boy finished. 

“Just the two of you?” 

“Sweet sweat, no!” laughed the 



boy. “Let’s see. There are eleven 
of us.” 

“Twelve!” the girl crowed. “I 
bet you forgot the robot again.” 
“Maybe I did. You and me, 
Tunt. Four boys. Three girls. A 
grown-up. A Martian . and 
the robot. Yeah, twelve.” 

“You mean a Martian like 
Heinzlichen what’s-his-name?” 
“Oh, no, Charles! Heinzie’s a 
dope, but he’s people. This is 
one of the big green ones with 
four arms.” 

Forrester did a double-take, 
then said, “You mean like in Ed- 
gar Rice Burroughs? But — but 
I didn’t think those were real — ” 
The boy looked politely inter- 
ested. “Yes? What about it?” 
“What do you mean by ‘real’, 
Charles?” asked the girl. 

I n the old days before Forres- 
ter died he had been a sci- 
ence-lover. It had always seemed 
to him wonderful and exciting 
that he should be living in an 
age where electricity came from 
wall sockets and living pictures 
from a box on a bench. He had 
thought sometimes, with irony 
and pity, of how laughably in- 
competent some great mind of 
the past, a Newton or Archime- 
des, would have been to follow 
his own six-year-old’s instructions 
about tuning a television set or 
operating his electric trains. So 
here I am, he thought wryly, the

bushman in Times Square. If a 
not much fun. 

But by careful and single- 
minded questioning he got some 
glimpse of what the children were 
talking about. Their playmates 
were not “real”, but they were 
a lot realer than, say, a Betsy- 
Wetsy doll. They were analogues 
— simulacra — the children call- 
ed thern “simulogs”, when press- 
ed. The little girl said proudly 
that they were very good at de- 
veloping inter-personal relation- 
ships. “Got that much,” said 
Charles, “or anyway I think I 
do. So what does Taiko have to 
do with it?” 

“Oh, him!” 

“He doesn’t like anything that’s 
fun.” 

“Says we’re losing the will to 
cope with — with what you said, 
Charles. ‘Reality.’ ” 

“And all that sweat,” added 
the girl. “Say! Would you like 
to hear him?” 

She glanced toward the view- 
well, now showing a placid back- 
ground scene of woody glades 
and small furry animals. “You 
mean on the television?” For- 
rester asked. 

“The what, Charles?" 

“On that.” 

“That’s right, Charles.” 

“Well,” said Forrester . 

And thought that, after all, he 
might as well. If worst came to 
worst, he could take up Taiko’s 

64 



offer of " a ^ job, assuming it was 
still open; and before he came 
to that worst he would be better 
off to known something about it. 
“Display away,” he said. “What 
have I got to lose?” 

^"T^he viewing wall, obedient to 
the little girl’s orders, wash- 
ed out the forest glade and re- 
placed it with a stage. On it a 
man in a fright wig was bound- 
ing about and howling. 

With difficulty Forrester rec- 
ognized the blond, crew-cut 
visitor he had so unceremonious- 
ly got rid of — when? Was it 
only a couple of days ago? Taiko 
was doing a sort of ceremonial 
step dance, a couple of paces in 
one direction and a stomp; a 
couple of paces away, and an- 
other stomp. And what he was 
shouting seemed like gibberish to 
Forrester: 

“Lud, lords, led nobly!” 
(Stomp!) “Let Lud lead, lords 
(stomp!), lest lone, lorn lads lapse 
loosely (stomp!) into limljo!” 
(Stomp!) He faced forward and 
threw his arms wide. The camera 
zoomed in on his impassioned, 
tortured face. “Jeez, kids! You 
want to get your goddam brains 
scrambled? You want to be a 
juiceless jellyfish If you don’t, 
then — let Lud lead! (Stomp!) 
Let Lud lead! (Stomp!) Let Lud 
lead — ” 

The boy cried over the noise 

GALAXY 



From the view wall: “Now he’s 
going to ask for comments from 
the viewers. This is where we 
usually send in things to make 
tiim mad like. ‘Go back in the 
freezer, you old icy cube’ and 
'Taiko’s a dirty old Utopian!’ CH 
course, we don’t give our names.” 
“Today I was going to send in. 
If it was up to people like you 
we’d still be swinging from our 
tails like apes,’ ” said the girl 
thoughtfully, “but it probably 
wouldn’t make him very mad.” 
Forrester coughed. “Actually, 
I’d just as soon not make him 
mad. I may have to go to work 
for him.” 

The children stared at him, dis- 
mayed. The boy extinguished 
Taiko’s image on the view-wall 
and cried, “Please, Charles, don’t 
do that! Mim said you turned 
him down.” 

“I did, but I may have to re^ 
consider; I have to get some kind 
of a job. Matter of fact, that’s 
why I’m here.” 

“Oh, good,” said the girl. 
“Mim’ll get you a job. Won’t she, 
Tunt?” 

“If she can,” the boy said un- 
certainly. “What can you do?” 
“That’s one of my problems. 
But there has to be something; 
I’m running out of money.” 
They did not respond to that, 
merely looked at him wide-eyed. 
They not only looked astonished, 
they looked embarrassed. 



At length the little girl sighed 
and said, “Charles, you’re so 
sweaty ignorant I could freeze. I 
never heard of anybody being 
out of money, ’cept the Forgotten 
Men. Don’t you know how to get 
a job?” 

“Not very well.” 

“You use the joymaker,” the 
boy said patiently. 

“Sure. I tried that.” 

The boy looked excited. “You 
mean — look, Charles, you want 
me to help you? Cause I will. I 
mean, we had that last year in 
Phase Five. All you have to do 
is — ” 

His expression suddenly be- 
came crafty. “Oh, sweat, Char- 
les,” he said carelessly, “let me 
do it for you. Just, uh, tell it to 
listen to me.” 

Forrester didn’t need the girl’s 
look of thrilled shock to warn 
him. “Nope,” he said firmly. “I’ll 
wait for your mother to come 
home.” 

The boy grinned and surren- 
dered. “All right. Charles. I just 
wanted to ask it something about 
Mim’s other, uh, friends. Well, 
here’s what you do. Tell it you 
want to be tested for an employ- 
ability profile and then you want 
recommendations.” 

“I don’t exactly know what 
that involves,” Forrester said 
cautiously. 

The boy sighed. “You don’t 
have to, Charles. Just do it. What

the sweat do you think the joy- 
maker’s for?” 

\ nd actually, it turned out 
pretty easy, although the 
“employability profile” testing 
involved some rather weird ques- 
tions — 

What is ‘God’? 

Are your stools black and 
tarry? 

If you happened to be a girl, 
would you wish you were a boy? 

Assume there are Plutonians. 
Assume there are elves. If elves 
attacked Pluto without warning, 
whose side would you be on? 

Why are you better than any- 
one else? 

Most of the questions were like 
that. Some were worse — either 
totally incomprehensible to For- 
rester, or touching on matters 
that made him blush and glance 
uneasily at the children. But the 
children seemed to take it as a 
matter of course, and indeed 
grew bored before long and wan- 
dered back to their own view- 
wall, where they watched what 
seemed to be a news broadcast. 
Forrester growled out the an- 
swers as best he could, having 
come to the conclusion that the 
machine knew what it was doing 
even if he didn’t. The answers, 
of course, made no more sense 
than the questions ; tardily he 
realized that the joymaker was 
undoubtedly monitoring his ner- 



vous system and learning more 
from the impulses that raced 
through his brain than from his 
words, anyway. Which was con- 
firmed when, at the end of the 
questions, the joymaker said: 
“Man Forrester, we will now ob- 
serve you until you return to rest 
state. I will then inform you as 
to employability.” 

Forrester stood up, stretched 
and looked around the room. He 
could not help feeling that he 
had been through an ordeal. Be- 
ing reborn was nearly as much 
trouble as being born in the first 
place. 

The children were discussing 
the scene on the view-wall, which 
seemed to show a crashed airlin- 
er surrounded by emergency 
equipment, on what appeared to 
be a mountain-top somewhere. 
Men and machines were dousing 
it with chemical sprays and 
carrying out injured and dead — 
if they made that distinction — 
on litters, to what Forrester rec- 
ognized by the ruby caduceus as 
death-reversal vehicles. The 
mountainside was dotted with 
what looked like pleasure craft — 
tiny, bright-colored aircraft that 
had no visible business there, 
and that seemed to be occupied 
by sightseers. No doubt they 
were, thought Forrester — reiiu'in- 
bering the crowds that had stood 
by the night he was burned to 
death, heedless of icy spiny, icy

winds and irritated police trying 
to push them back. 

“Old Hap’s never going to 
make it,” said the boy to the girl, 
and looked up to see Forrester. 
“Oh, you’re done?” 

Forrester nodded. A drone 
from the view-wall saying,” — 
made it again, with a total to this 
minute of thirty-one and fifty- 
five, out of a possible ninety- 
eight. Not bad for the Old Mas- 
ter! Yet Hap still trails the 
rookie Maori from Pore Mores- 
by — ” 

“What are you watching?” he 
asked. 

“Just the semi-finals,” said the 
boy. “How’d you make out on 
your tests?” 

“I don’t have the results yet.” 
The screen flickered and showed 
a new picture, a sort of stylized 
star-map with arrows and dots 
of green and gold. Forrester said, 
“Is ten million a year too much 
to ask for?” 

“Sweat, Charles! How would 
we know?” The boy was clearly 
more interested in the view-wall 
than in Forrester, but he was 
polite enough to add: “Tunt’s 
projected life average is about 
twelve million a year. Mine’s fif- 
teen. But of course we’ve got uh, 
more advantages,” he said deli- 
cately. 

Forrester sat down and re- 
signed himself to waiting for the 
results. The arrows and circles 



were moving about the star-map, 
and a voice was saying: “ — probe 
reports from 61 Cygni, Proxima 
Centauri, Epsilon Indi and Cor- 
doba 31353 show no sign of arti- 
factual activity and no change in 
net systemic energy levels.” 

“Dopes!” shrilled the little 
girl. “They couldn’t find a Mar- 
tian in a mattress.” 

“ — at Groombridge 1830, how- 
ever, the unidentified object 
monitored six days ago shows no 
sign of emission and has been 
tentatively identified as a large 
comet, although its anecliptic or- 
bit marks this large and massive 
intruder as a potential trouble 
spot. Needless to say, it is being 
carefully watched, and SEPF 
headquarters in Federal City an- 
nounce that they are phasing two 
additional monitors out of their 
passive orbits . .” 

“What are they talking 
about?” Forrester asked the boy. 

“The war, of course. Shut up, 
won’t you?” 

“ — Well, there’s good news to- 
night from 22H Camelopardis! 
A late bulletin just received from 
sortie-control headquarters states 
that the difficult task of replac- 
ing the damaged probe has beenj 
completed! The first of the re-, 
placements rushed out from BO 
7899 has achieved stellar orbit 
in a near-perfect, almost circular 
orbit, and all systems are go. 
Seven back-up replacements — ” 



fHE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



67 



“Sweat,” said the girl. “What 
a tedious war! Charles, you 
used to do things better didn’t 
you?” 

“In what way?” 

The girl looked puzzled. “More 
killing, of course.” 

“If you call that better, maybe 
we did. World War Two killed 
like twenty million people, I 
think.” 

“Weep. Twenty million'' 
breathed the girl. “And so far 
we’ve killed, what is it, Tunt? 
Twenty-two?” 

“Twenty-two million?” asked 
Forrester. 

The boy shook his head dis- 
gustedly. “Twenty-two individ- 
ual Sirians. Isn’t that rotten?” 

T)ut before Forrester could an- 
swer his joymaker spoke up: 

“Man Forrester! Your tests 
have been integrated and as- 
sayed. May I display the tran- 
script on Bensen children equip- 
ment?” 

“Go ahead,” the boy said sul- 
lenly. “Can’t be any worse than 
that." 

The star-map disappeared 
from the wall and was replaced 
by shimmering sine-waves, punc- 
tuated with numbers that were 
quite meaningless to Forrester. 
“You may apply for re-evalua- 
tion on any element of the pro- 
file, if you wish. Do you wish to 
do this, Man Forrester?” 



“Hell, no.” The numbers and 
graphs were not only meaningless 
but disturbing. Forrester had a 
flash of memory which he iden- 
tified as coming from the last 
time a government agency had 
concerned itself with finding him 
a job — after his discharge from 
the peacetime conscription term, 
when he joined the long lines of 
unemployables telling their lies 
to a bored State Employment 
Service clerk. He could almost 
see the squares of linoleum on 
the floor, the queues of those 
who, like himself, wanted only 
to collect unemployment insur- 
ance for a while, in the hope that 
the world would clarify itself to 
them. 

But the joymaker was talking: 
“Your profile, Man Forrester, 
indicates relatively high employ- 
ability in personal-service and 
advocative categories. I have se- 
lected ninety-three possible open- 
ings. Shall I give you the list?” 
“My God, no. Just give me 
the one you like best.” 

“Your optimum choice, Man 
Forrester, is as follows: Salary, 
seventeen thousand five hundred. 
This is rather less than your 
stated requirements, but an ex- 
pense — ” 

“Hold on a minute! I’ll say it’s 
less! I was asking for ten mil- 
lion!” 

“Yes, Man Forrester. You 
stated ten million per year. This 



68 



GALAXY 



is seventeen thousand five hun- 
dred per day. At four-day week 
norm, allowing for projected 
overtime as against health losses, 
three million eight hundred thou- 
sand dollars per year. Expenses 
are also included, however, op- 
timized at five million plus in 
addition to salary.” 

“Wait a minute.” The numbers 
were so large as to be dizzying. 
He turned to the children. 
“That’s almost nine million a 
year. Can I live on that?” 

“Sweat, Charles, sure, if you 
want to.” 

Forrester took a deep breath. 
“I’ll take it,” he said. 

'"^he joymaker did not seem 
particularly concerned. “Very 
well, Man Forrester. Your duties 
are as follows: Conversation. 

Briefing. Discussion. The orien- 
tation is timeless, so your status 
as a recent disfreeze will not be 
a handicap. You will be expected 
to answer questions and be avail- 
able for discussions, usually re- 
mote due to habitat considera- 
tions. Some travel is indicated.” 
“Sweat.” The Bensen children 
showed signs of interest; the boy 
sat up and his sister stared wide- 
eyed at Forrester. 

“Supplementary information, 
Man Forrester: This employer 
has rejected automated services 
for heuristic reasons. His desid- 
eratum is subjectivity rather than 



accuracy of data. The employer 
is relatively unfamiliar with hu- 
man history, culture and cus- 
toms — ” 

“It fs!” cried the girl. 

“ — and will supplement your 
services with TIC data as need- 
ed.” Forrester cut in. “Never 
mind that. Where do I go for my 
interview?” 

“Man Forrester, you have had 
it.” 

“You mean I’ve got the job? 
But — but what do I do next?” 

“Man Forrester, I was outlin- 
ing the procedure. Please note 
the following signal.” There was 
a mellow, booming chime. “This 
will indicate a message from your 
employer. Under the terms of 
your employment contract you 
may not decline to accept these 
messages during the hours of ten 
hundred to fourteen hundred on 
working days. You are further 
required to receive such messages 
with no more than twelve hours’ 
delay even on non-worldng days.” 

And that, thought Forrester, 
was that. 

Except for trying to find out 
what was bugging the kids. He 
said, “All right. What’s eating 
you?” 

They were whispering togeth- 
er, their eyes on him. The boy 
stopped long enough to ask, 
“Eating us, Charles?” 

“Why are you acting like 
that?” Forrester amended. 



THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



69 



“Oh, nothing,” the boy said. 
“Nothing important ” correct- 
ed the girl. 

“Come on!” 

The little girl said, “It’s just 
that we never knew anybody 
who’d work for them before.” 
“Work for who?” 

“The joymaker told you, Char- 
les! Don’t you listen?” said the 
boy, and the girl chimed in: 
“Sweat, Charles! Don’t you 
know who you’re working for?” 
Forrester took a deep breath 
and glared at them. He told him- 
self that they were only children, 
and that in fact he was rather 
fond of them; but they seemed 
on this particular morning to be 
determined to drive him mad. 
He sat down and picked up his 
joymaker. Carefully he scanned 
the cluster of buttons until he 
found the crystal-clear, rounded 
one he was looking for, turned 
the joymaker until its spray- 
nozzle was pointing at the ex- 
posed flesh on his arm and 
pressed the button. 

Happily it was the right but- 
ton. What the fine mist that 
danced into his wrist might be 
he did not know, but it achieved 



the expected effect. It was like a 
super- tranquilizer; it cleared his 
mind, quieted his pulse and en- 
abled him to say, quite calmly, 
“Machine! Just who the hell have 
you got me working for?” 

“Do you wish me to display a 
picture of your employer, Man 
Forrester?” 

“You damn bet I wish!” 
“Please observe the view-wall, 
Man Forrester.” 

And observe it Forrester did; 
and swallowed hard, stunned. 

In all justice to the joymaker, 
Forrester was forced to admit 
that he had placed no restrictions 
on its choice of an employer for 
him. He had been willing to ac- 
cept almost anything, but all the 
same he was surprised. 

He hadn’t expected his em- 
ployer to have bright green fur, 
or a diadem of tiny eyes, peering 
out of a ruff around a pointed 
head, or tentacles. He had not, 
in fact, expected it to be one of 
The Enemy, the race whose pres- 
ence in space had scared man- 
kind into a vast series of raid 
drills, weapons-programs and 
space probes ... in short, a Sir- 
ian. ^

He seemed fo be reading minds. 
Bui whose? They certainly did 
not belong io anybody be knew! 



T ester Shay was married three 
months when he got his first 
Erector set. Thalia, noting that 
he felt tired and rundown, or- 
dered him to get a checkup. Too 
tired and rundown to object, he 
went to see Dr. Peabody. 

“Very surprising,” the physi- 
cian said after an embarrassingly 
thorough examination. “Married 
three months, beautiful, affec- 
tionate bride — but you get plen- 
ty of sleep, outdoors a lot, a 
moderate amount of exercise.” 

“I do all my own marketing,” 
said Les, who owned a wholesale 
grocery business. “I walk every 
chance I get, which is consider- 
able. Marketing is all outdoors, 
you know. And I have to get to 
sleep early, because if I don’t get 
up early, my competitors — ” 



“Exactly. And I know it’s not 
overwork. I’m overworked my- 
self, but I’m in tiptop condition.” 

“How do you manage it?” ask- 
ed Les, interested in a tired, run- 
down way. 

“A hobby,” said Dr. Peabody. 

“Gardening? Raising tropical 
fi,sh? Golf?” 

“The last thing you’d expect,” 
Dr. Peabody said, leaning for- 
ward excitedly. “I know a lot of 
dentists. They give me old fillings 
and I’ve got this little smelter, 
see, and I break down the amal- 
gam into silver and mercury, 
then sell the stuff back to the 
dentists. Darn near pays for it- 
self! And fun? You ought to come 
visit my basement sometime!” 

Shambling home, Les wonder- 
ed what he could take up as a 



71 



hobby. Nightclubs and theaters 
wouldn’t do. They let out too late. 
Besides, they weren’t a hobby. 
Raising things was too close to 
his actual work; it would make 
him think about produce and 
canned goods. He did enough 
outdoor walking to eliminate 
sports. 

That was when he saw the 
Erector set in the store window. 

T T e stopped and studied it, 
looking more wistful now 
than tired or rundown. He had 
always wanted an Erector set, 
but his parents, believers in as 
the twig is bent so grows the 
tree, had refused to buy him one. 
They didn’t, they explained, want 
their son to become a mechanic. 
Not, mind you, they’d added, 
that there was anything wrong 
with mechanics. But he was wor- 
thy of great things. They had 
also been disappointed when he 
went into the wholesale grocery 
line, were more pleased now be- 
cause he was doing well in it, but 
that wasn’t important. He still 
wanted an Erector set. 

When he got home, Thalia 
looked expectantly at the large, 
heavy box. He had bought the 
biggest and most expensive set, 
of course. 

“Oh, something for the house?” 
she asked, obviously hoping it 
wasn’t. 

“Doctor said I needed a hobby 
72 



or something,” he explained un- 
comfortably. 

“Wonderful!” she exclaimed. 
“We can do it together!” 

“You mean you like working 
on Erector sets, too?” he cried. 

“Oh,” she said. “Well, that’s 
really a — well, a man’s hobby.” 

She gave him the room that 
would some day be a nursery 
and he built a parachute jump, 
a stake truck, a windmill and a 
ski tow. The spring came back 
to his walk and the roses to his 
cheeks. 

But less than a week later, ly- 
ing in bed with his bride in his 
arms, he could sense the old tired, 
rundown feeling creep up on 
him. 

“What’s the matter, darling?” 
Thalia asked, disconcerted. “Is it 
the onions I had for dinner?”* 

“Oh, no, sweetheart!” he tried 
to answer hastily, only it came 
out a slow sigh. “It’s the Erector 
set.” 

“The — Erector set? Oh! The 
Erector set. Well, if it’s broken, 
darling, you can always buy an- 
other.” 

“It’s not broken. That isn’t the 
trouble,” he sighed again, and 
turned over and moodily went to 
sleep. 

The problem was still on his 
mind in the pre-dawn at the mar- 
ket. Kale was coming in nicely 
and he had bought all the primes 
offered by the farmers. He mor- 

GALAXY 



osely helped Arnie, his driver, 
load up. 

“What happened to the old 
zip?” Amie asked concernedly. 
“You were feeling great for a 
while. Down in the dumps 
again?” 

“I guess so,” said Les. “Tem- 
porarily, at least. I hope.” 

“You ought to try tooling one 
of these monmouths through city 
traffic. Gotta judge every inch 
of the way. Boy, you drive one 
and I bet you won’t have a min- 
ute to — ” 

Les found himself listening in- 
tently, but not to Arnie’s good- 
natured chatter. Something was 
wrong. He knew it was wrong. 
But what? 

No, not like walking barefooted 
in spilled sugar, he mused. 
Though it was a little like that 
— sort of gritty. But painful, too. 
As if he were trying to run with 
a sore socket in his leg. 

“You’ve got a bearing burning 
out,” Les interrupted. 

Arnie took a fast glance at him. 
“Since when you know about 
motors, Boss?” 

“A bearing,” said Les. “That’s 
what it feels like.” 

Les nodded at a service sta- 
tion up ahead. “Pull in there. I 
want to have it checked.” 

'"T^he garageman examined the 
motor and found a bearing 
rubbed so raw that Les had to 

INSIDE MAN 



turn away in compassion and 
disgust. He left Arnie, puzzled 
enough to be silent for once, at 
the service station and walked 
alone the rest of the way to the 
office. 

Les discovered he was sur- 
rounded by sensations ranging 
from purrs of pleasure all the 
way to groans of pain. One purr 
came from a trim little Porscht 
— new tune-up job, a little heavy 
on the grease, but that would 
thin out on the straightaway, he 
thought, and the unexpected 
thought alarmed him. 

Thought? He considered. It 
was a feeling, a very strong and 
explicit emotion. So was the sym- 
pathy for a passing cab that real- 
ly wanted to lie down on some 
nice, restful junkpile. A painful 
click, click bothered him. He 
looked up. It was a tower clock, 
desperately clawing its way 
around the hours on eroded cams. 
Damn the sadists who would put 
a conscientious servant through 
such torture, he thought angrily. 

But he felt equally guilty 
when he came into the office and 
heard Miss Zeichner typing. The 
dogs in the escape mechanism 
were practically howling and the 
keys were moving only because 
her slim but powerful fingers 
were beating them into moving. 

“Leave that alone!” Les said, 
more sharply than he’d intended. 
“I mean, no more typing for to- 

73 



day,” he amended when she 
jumped and looked frightened. 

“But the filing’s all done and 
I have a perfect mess of corres- 
pondence to get out,” she ob- 
jected. “If I don’t do it today 
• 

“Not on that battered hulk,” 
he told her. 

He called and ordered a new 
electric typewriter. Miss Zeichner 
was, as she put it, thrilled. He 
shrugged. She always was either 
thrilled or absolutely — com- 
pletely and absolutely — shatter- 
ed. But only over unimportant 
things. 

For instance, was she com- 
pletely and absolutely shattered 
by the pained limpings and 
clenched-teeth determination to 
do a job, to keep those pistons 
pumping no matter what the cost; 
completely and absolutely thrill- 
ed by the sleek, contented mur- 
murs, the happy little laughs of 
conscious strength, easy power, 
the cared-for feeling; or com- 
pletely and absolutely dismayed 
by the breathless puffing under a 
merciless load, like — 

He listened sharply. He felt 
more sharply still. 

It came from the warehouse 
behind the office. He sprang out 
of his seat savagely enough to 
upset Miss Zeichner again, raced 
into the warehouse. 

A valiant little fork-lift truck, 
overloaded by half again too 
74 



many cases of canned salmon, 
was almost red-faced with strain. 

Les leaped aboard, switched off 
the motor, hauled out the man, 
shoved him against the wall and 
started a murderous swing. 

“Mr. Shay!” yelped the man. 
“What did I do wrong?” 

It was Walt’s voice. Les blink- 
ed, dropped his fist, slumped. 

“Sorry, Walt,” he mumbled. 
“Guess I’m all on edge today. 
You had that fork-lift overload- 
ed and it — it jarred me. Sorry.” 
Walt picked his shirt button 
up off the floor. “Hell, Mr. Shay, 
it’s all right. I’d probably feel 
the same if somebody was ruin- 
ing my property.” 

“ Property \” shouted Les, going 
for him again. “Things like ma- 
chines — property]” 

Arnie, back while his truck 
was being repaired, caught Les 
from behind and held and sooth- ' 
ed him into the office. 

“You’re all tensed up. Boss,” 
Amie said. “I’ll get you a cab 
and you can go home and take a 
hot bath and relax with your slip- 
pers and bathrobe and newspa- 
per. How about it, huh?” 

“I suppose so,” Les muttered. 
“I’m not much help today.” 

The cab was in good shape 
— that new pinion hurt a little, 
but it would break in soon — 
and Les sat back, easing, and 
even joined the comfortable, un- 
worried motor hum. 



GALAXY 



T ike all affectionate brides, 
' beautiful or otherwise, when 
their husbands come home half a 
day early, Thalia was flattered 
and coy, then concerned when he 
abstractedly pecked her only 
once to her dozens of kisses on 
the face and mouth and ears and 
neck, then relieved when he told 
her he wasn’t sick, and finally de- 
lighted because now he could 
help plan the menu for tonight. 
“Menu?” he repeated. 

“The Fitches are coming for 
dinner.” 

“Fitch? Fitch — good God — 
he has seventeen stores — if I 
get the account — what do you 
mean, menu? Cavier, bluepoints, 
vichysoisse, filet mignon, breast 
of guinea hen — ” 

“Darling,” she said. “Mr. 
Fitch has an ulcer.” 

“Ulcer,” said Les. “Milk and 
crackers. Cottage cheese.” 
“What about that new line of 
dietetic food you said you could 
tie up if you only had the out- 
lets?” 

“Hey!” he cried. “Why’d I 
have to go marry you and lose 
the best office manager I ever 
had?” 

“Because it was one or the oth- 
er. 

He gave her a dirty grin. 
“Well, I was tired of being a 
working girl,” she 'said defen- 
sively. “Every real, honest-to- 
goodness woman wants — ” 
INSIDE MAN 



“I know what every real, hon- 
est-to-goodness woman wants. 
Let’s let the menu wait, because 
every real, honest-to-goodness 
man wants what every real, hon- 
est-to-goodness woman — ” 

She wriggled out of his arms. 
“And with me going frantic? I 
was going to phone you to pick 
up those dietetic foods and bring 
them home with you tonight. 
Now we’ll have to get a special 
messenger.” 

“Yeah,” he said. “It’s frus- 
trating, but you’re right. Why 
can’t Miss Zeichner — ” 

“Oh, she’ll learn, darling. Just 
give her time.” 

“Hah!” he said. “Why, you 
wouldn’t believe it, but — ” 

“The menu,” she told him 
firmly. “And the messenger.” 

ti'V^ell, look, damn it,” Les 
’argued the next morning, 
waiting for an elevator with Tha- 
lia in the Medical Building. “Just 
because I didn’t get the Fitch ac- 
count is no reason to haul me to a 
psychiatrist!” 

“Lower your voice. People are 
looking,” she shushed. “It isn’t 
that and you know it, darling.” 
. “You mean Mrs. Fitch’s watch? 
Well, there were two damaged 
jewels in it!” 

“But to take it off her wrist 
right in the middle of dinner and 
go racing out in search of a jew- 
eler at that time of night — ”

“I got one, didn’t I? And he 
saw the cracked one on the top 
and put up a battle when I hold 
him about the chipped one under- 
neath, but he took the watch 
apart and sure enough — ” 

“Yes, darling. I know. That’s 
not what’s important.” 

The elevator door opened and 
they got in. 

“Then what is?” challenged 
Les. 

She glanced at the elevator 
operator and whispered, “What 
you told me after Mr. Fitch said 
they couldn’t wait any longer 
for you to get back and to send 
the watch — Les! You’re not 
listening!” 

But he was. He was listening 
very hard. 

“The poor thing,” he said, 
shaking his head sadly. 

She looked around. Except for 
the operator, they were alone in 
the elevator. 

“Who?” she asked. 

“The elevator. When are peo- 
ple going to learn that too much 
oil — ” 

“That’s what I mean, darling.” 
She guided him across the cor- 
ridor and opened the door to a 
waiting room. Shakily she said. 
“Now there isn’t a thing to worry 
about.” 

“Oh, no?” he snapped. “With 
imbeciles and bunglers torment- 
ing defenseless machines that ask 
nothing more than to be done by 
76 



as they do, living by the Golden 
Rule, which is more than I can 
say — ” 

“Mr. Shay?” inquired the 
nurse-receptionist at the desk. 
“You may go right in. Dr. Hyde 
is expecting you.” 

“Dr. Hyde,” snarled Les. “I 
bet he’s got a silent partner 
named Mr. Jekyll.” 

He flung open the door and 
slammed it shut behind him. 

VYT^ith his hands behind his 
head, Les lay staring up at 
the ceiling, blinking once a min- 
ute. Thalia inchwormed rapidly 
toward him until her head was 
under his chin. 

“Darling?” she said in a very 
little voice. 

He breathed slightly harder on 
her hair to show he was paying 
attention. 

“You know, we’ve only been 
married three months,” she said, 
“and already we act as if we’d 
grown old and gray together.” 

“Uh,” he told her. 

“Well, I don’t feel old and 
gray.” She paused. “Do you?” 

“Um,” he elaborated. 

“You just lie there,” she cried 
angrily. “Don’t you give one 
single, solitary thought to how 
— how undesirable it makes me 
feel?” 

He forced his throat to move, 
then his tongue, finally his lips. 
“You’re not.”

“Then what — ” She stopped, 
was silent for a long moment. 
“I’m a heel,” she said against his 
chest. “You’re trying to digest 
what Dr. Hyde said to you to- 
day.” 

Les sat up abruptly with his 
back against the headboard, one 
stiff forefinger stabbing repeated- 
ly at the mattress. “Not digest. 
Regurgitate.” 

“It made sense to me, darling.” 
“What? That I wanted to kill 
my father for not buying me an 
Erector set?” 

“Well, didn’t you?” 

“Of course not! And why not 
my mother, too? She had just as 
much to do with me not getting 
it as he did.” 

“The Oedipal situation.” 

“And if 1 say she loused me up 
more than Dad ever did, you’ll 
agree with Hyde that I’m dis- 
placing or something. Oh, no. 
You’re not catching me in that 
no-exit trap. Besides, Dad bought 
me a bike right afterward and I 
had a hell of a lot more fun with 
it than I’d have gotten out of an 
Erector set. Mom had plenty to 
say about the danger of riding a 
bike in the city, but he trusted 
my judgment and bought one 
just the same.” 

“Infantilizing you, darling,” 
she said gently, “instead of help- 
ing you learn to accept inevitable 
frustrations.” 

“Who was frustrated?” he 

INSIDE MAN 



shouted. “I loved that bike! And 
not only that, I didn’t even think 
once of an Erector set till Dr. 
Peabody suggested 1 take up a 
hobby!” He waited. “Go ahead, 
say it — I repressed the whole 
thing, didn’t I?” 

“That’s what Dr. Hyde said, 
darling.” 

“All right, smart guy, see v.?hat 
you make of this. I told him the 
truth, every bit of it, and he says 
hallucinations. So I say oh, yeah, 
what about the water cooler over 
in the corner and he says what 
about the water cooler. And I 
tell him there’s a tiny leak in the 
refrigerating coil and he takes 
a look, only the crack is too small 
to see, but in a month or two 
they’ll have to seal it up and put 
in more refrigerant, you wait and 
see if they don’t.” 

“And in the meantime?” she 
asked. “We can’t have you go 
around in this nervous state.” 

“I know,” he said miserably. 
“The rheostat on the electric 
mixer is calibrated wrong, the 
oil burner is feeding too fast, the 
bulb in the hall is about ready 
to blow, we got a lemon of a 
pre-amp in the hi-fi, the turn- 
table is almost a full rpm too 
slow, and I bet there’s going to 
be a pip of a smashup on the 
highway — I don’t like the way 
the traffic light feels.” 

“Feels?” 

“Yes,” he said flatly. “Feels.” 

77 



“Darling?” she started again. 

“Urn.” 

“You know you’re only person- 
alizing these things the way you 
did when you were so awfully 
disappointed about the Erector 
set.” 

“Sure, sure.” 

“It’s just a matter of accepting 
that emotionally.” 

“I’m working on it.” 

“And you don’t need your 
mother any more. You have me.” 

He rolled out of bed. “I never 
thought of that,” he said, and 
began unbuttoning his pajama 
top. 

“Darling, what have you got 
in mind?” she asked, wide-eyed. 

“Taking a walk to clear my 
head. You and Hyde have all the 
explanations. Without the two 
of you to confuse me, maybe I 
can find the answers.” 

C hiUed and tired, Les wandered 
into Mike’s All Nite Garage. 
Mike jMDked his head out from 
under a car on the grease pit and 
asked, “Do something for you, 
Mr. Shay?” 

“No,” said Les. “You fix them 
instead of ruining them.” 

“That’s how I make my living,” 
Mike said cheerfully. “If they 
didn’t ruin ’em, I wouldn’t have 
’em to fix.” 

Les, about to retort in sudden 
rage, sat down on a fender in- 
stead and thought about Mike’s 
78 



philosophy. It was as if dentists 
hired thugs to bash in people’s 
teeth so there would always be 
work, or veterinarians poisoned 
animals just enough to need 
treatment. He decided he didn’t 
like Mike’s reasoning. He also 
decided not to argue about it; 
he was tired of strange looks and 
counter-arguments. 

Mike climbed out of the pit, 
wiped his hands on a ball of dirty 
cotton waste and got into the car 
to start the motor. He cocked his 
head like a music critic listening 
first to one section of the orches- 
tra and then the other. 

“Sounds pretty good,” he pro- 
nounced. 

“The generator,” said Les. 

Mike frowned. “What about 
the generator?” 

“It’s undercharging.” 

“Hell it is!” 

“Hell it isn’t.” 

Mike glanced at the needle and 
winked. “So, okay, more busi- 
ness.” Then he scowled at Les. 
“How’d you know it was under- 
charging?” 

“It’s a long story. You have 
any more jobs tonight, Mike?” 

“Nope. Why?” 

“You’ve got a bunch of cars 
on the lot. I’ve got ten bucks to 
either prove or disprove some- 
thing. Deal?” 

“Deal,” said Mike, leading the 
way out to the lot. 

By the seventh car, Mike was 
GALAXY 



quiet and thoughtful. Les had 
found only one that murmured 
tranquilly and when he stated 
what was wrong with each, and 
Mike checked, Les had pinpoint- 
ed the trouble exactly. 

“Well, how do you account 
for that?” Les wanted to know. 

Mike did some meditative 
scratching. “I go by ear myself, 
Mr. Shay. I can listen to a motor 
and tell pretty near what’s wrong. 
You just got a better ear than 
me, that’s all.” 

“And when it isn’t the mo- 
tor? A lot of things in the body 
and chassis didn’t squeak or rat- 
tle.” 

“Yeah,” said Mike. “I was 
thinking about them. I can’t fig- 
ure it out.” 

“I can,” another voice said. 

Les leaped. A solemn face 
with a slight stubble and a greasy 
homburg was leaning out of a 
car window. 

“Sorry, Prof,” said Mike. “I 
didn’t mean to wake you. Prof, 
Mr. Shay. I let the Prof sleep 
in the cars, provided he takes his 
shoes off and keeps his hat on.” 

“My pleasure, Mr. Shay,” an- 
nounced the Prof. 

“H-hello,” said Les. “You did 
say you could figure it out?” 

“No mystery at all,” the Prof 
said. “Can you do this only with 
automobiles or all kinds of ma- 
chinery?” 

“All kinds.” 

INSIDE MAN 



“Then the answer is very sim- 
ple.” stated the Prof. “Telepa- 
thy.” 

'^Telepathy!” 

“Of a very highly specialized 
variety.” The Prof looked hope- 
fully at Les. “Is the full explana- 
tion worth the price of a drink?” 

“I’ll say!” exclaimed Les. 

^■y^halia opened red eyes and 
watched Les pick his way 
across the uncluttered floor to 
the closet. 

“Well?” she said. “Did you find 
your answers?” 

“Ah — you bet,” said Les, 
carefully dropping his clothes to 
the floor. 

“In a bottle.” 

“Over a bottle. With the most 
profound — makes your Dr. 
Hyde sound — listening with the 
third ear when he should be using 
all three!” 

“Okay, go on,” she said re- 
signedly. 

“Nothing to it. I’m a specia- 
list.” 

“A specialist?” 

He sat down on the bed to 
tangle with his shoelaces. “A 
born mechanic.” 

“Now look here, Lester Shay! 
If you think you’re going to give 
up a perfectly good business to 
go rummaging around in cars — ” 

“Don’t have to,” he answered 
peacefully. “Just gotta harden 
myself. That’s what the Prof says. 

79 



He’s not really a professor, only 
talks that way because he claims 
it intimidates people.” 

“A bum!” 

‘‘No, sweetheart. A different 
kind of specialist. Damn shoe- 
laces!” He snapped them and 
kicked his shoes across the room. 
‘‘His notion is that evolution al- 
ways starts with simple, general 
types and works up to highly 
specialized ones.” 

“Like born mechanics!” 

He smiled delightedly. “That’s 
it. Or born mathematicians. Or 
born laborers. Or born artists, 
salesmen, farmers — ” 

“Bums.” 

“Oh, just the very, very, very, 
good ones,” he corrected her 
owlishly. “The others work at it, 
but they’re not specialists. Way 
he puts it, the difference is in the 
degree of success.” 

“And,” she said, “you’re a bom 
mechanic.” 

“Right, Just never got a chance 
to start. Better this way, though. 
You see, I know what machines 
feel because I feel it, too. If I’d 
been doing that all these years, 
I’d be nothing but nerves. A lot 
of people don’t treat machines 
right, you know. Feeling how the 
machines suffer would put me in 
just as bad shape as they are.” 
She sat up interestedly. “This 
Prof of yours sounds bright. Did 
he tell you how to get rid of 
your — your — ” 

80 



“Affliction, darling. It’s like 
when a surgeon goes down the 
street and he sees people in dras- 
tic need of operations and can’t 
do anything about it. Couldn’t 
club them, haul them away to 
the hospital, operate on them, 
could he?” 

“No, of course not.” 

“So he has to steel himself. Or 
take the gardener who feels what 
flowers feel. And grass. Srubbery. 
He has to cut the flowers, mow 
the lawn, clip the hedges. If he 
felt every slash into every bit of 
vegetation, weeds included — 
well, you can imagine.” 

She thought. “Yes, I think I 
can. And what about you, darl- 
ing?” 

“Same thing. Steel myself. The 
Prof says I can’t take care of 
all the machines in the world and 
he’s right. So I gotta shut out 
the cries and groans and moans 
of the machinery. You see?” 

“I see, but can you do it?” 
she asked worriedly. 

“Diversion does the trick. If I 
receive, I just make sure I re- 
ceive something else. The Prof 
suggested trying people. So I did, 
down at the tavern.” 

“How did you make out?” 
“Noisy damned place,” he 
said. “And full of alcoholic 
thoughts. But I concentrated and 
it blanked out the screeching fan 
and the pump in the cellar that 
needs cleaning so badly — ” 

GALAXY 



“People’s thoughts,” said Tha- 
lia uneasily. “I don’t know if I 
like that. I know I wouldn’t feel 
comfortable around you.” 

He plumped up the pillow, ac- 
cidentally dropped it on the floor, 
tired to decide whether to pick 
it up, realized he would fall on 
top of it. 

“Doesn’t work that way at all, 
sweetheart. It’s — ” He hunted 
for an analogy. “It comes out 
like machinery.” 

“Like what?” she exclaimed. 
“Here, maybe I can show you.” 
He stood beside the bed and 
gazed down searchingly at her. 



“Mm-fiumm. Your radiator is 
boiling over.” 

“What a crude way to put it!” 

He continued standing there, 
his gaze gone remote and unsee- 
ing. 

“Well?” Thalia asked ir- 
ritably. “How’s your radiator?” 

“That’s what I’m trying to find 
out,” he replied in a distant voice. 

“And?” 

“It’s percolating a little,” he 
answered. 

She threw the covers aside. 
“Come on, get in,” she said. “It’s 
better than nothing.”

FIFTEEN YEARS OF GALAXY - 
THIRTEEN YEARS OF F.U 

G alaxy Magazine is 15 years 
old with this issue, but my 
column is not, even though I was 
represented in Vol. I. No. 1. It 
was an article on Flying Saucers, 
written at the editor’s request 
and then considerably shortened 
by the same editor — but I no 
longer recall just what it was he 
snipped out. Flying Saucers were 



84 



a recent (phenomenon) at the 
time, stories about them had 
been in the daily press for about 
three years running. And while 
three years of stories without the 
faintest bit of evidence that 
would be considered as such in 
a court of law made me quite 
doubtful, one could not yet dis- 
miss the whole thing. 

I did not say so in print, but 
I had a nagging feeling that the 
“saucers” would turn out to be 
something like the case of the 
“Washington D.C. hair fetishist” 
that occupied space in the Wash- 
ington newspaper at the same 
time when the first flying saucer 
report from Boise, Idaho, made 
the front pages of the same 
newspaper which I read with 
great astonishment while sitting 
in the street car that brought me 
to my laboratory in College 
Park, Maryland, every morning. 
What happened was this: a girl 
turned up at the police station 
(or at the newspaper office. I 
don’t know which, since I paid 
no attention to the first report) 
claiming that somebody had cut 
off a heavy strand of her beauti- 
ful blonde hair while she was 
riding one of these self-same 
street cars during the morning 
rush hour. The police had hardly 
started an investigation, when 
another girl told the same story. 
Two days later a third incident 
occurred. I don’t know at what 



point the police grew suspicious, 
the newspapers did at about the 
seventh case, when the assailant 
was described as a young blond 
man — but the damage he ha;l 
done was hard to sVe. 

That girl then admitted that 
she only had wanted Co get her 
picture into the newspaper. Then 
the “case” before her admitted 
deception and so all the way 
back to the first case where the 
loss of hair had been due to an 
accident — with the afterthought 
that it should be exploited in 
some way. 

"VTow, eighteen years after the 

^ first flying saucer report in 
the Washington papers and fif- 
teen years after my article in the 
first issue of Galaxy I see a great 
deal of similarity in the two per- 
formances. 

During the second year of 
Galaxy’s existence I contributed 
a few scattered articles, one on 
the “Loon” missile which then 
received a great deal of publicity 
(in retrospect I fail to see why), 
one on the African aardvark and 
one on the “meteoric procession” 
of February 9, 1913. 

The last one, I admit, was 
written for the purpose of point- 
ing out that there can be very 
strange displays in the sky that 
have perfectly natural causes. Of 
course, neither efficient aircraft 
nor atom bombs existed in 1913,

hence people seeing something 
unusual had less reason to be- 
come jittery. 

The first regular column ap- 
peared in the March issue of 1952, 
the idea that I should write a 
regular column, ranging at ran- 
dom over the whole field of 
science, originated with Horace 
L. Gold, the first editor. The 
overall title of the column, I was 
told, was suggested by Theodore 
Sturgeon. Everything else was up 
to me, except that there was a 
rule in the beginning, that my 
column should resemble a news- 
paper column in that it consisted 
of a number of short items. And 
since Galaxy did not carry a reg- 
ular “letters to the editor” fea- 
ture, the letters containing scien- 
tific questions were shunted to 
me for incorporation in the col- 
umn. As regular readers know, I 
still answer such letters in my 
column if I feel the answer might 
be of general interest; provided, 
of course, that I know the an- 
swer. But “answerable” letters 
do not come in frequently; the 
majority of the letters I receive 
either ask questions that have no 
answer (e.g. “what are quasars”) 
or else the answer is not likely 
to be of general interest, as for 
example the title and publication 
date of a book my correspondent 
remembers incompletely. 

But let me backtrack a bit to 
the scientific news events that 



were recent when Galaxy was 
started. There was, of course, the 
“atom bomb” as it was then call- 
ed, <-he fission bomb as we call it 
now. To people who knew some- 
thing about atomic energy it was 
clear that the fusion or hydrogen 
bomb would follow — its devel- 
opment was then ordered by 
President Truman in January 
1950. 

Two recent astronomical d>s- 
coveries had been made by the 
same American astronomer, Ger- 
ard P. Kuiper. They were the 
fifth moon of Uranus which he 
had named Miranda (1948) and 
the second moon of Neptune 
which he had named Nereid 
(1949). 

'^he active space age was still 
five years in the future when 
Vol. I., No. 1. of Galaxy appear- 
ed on the newsstands. Few 
people knew at the time that 
space had already been reached, 
namely by Bumper No. 5 on Feb- 
ruary 24, 1949. The rocket had 
been the fifth in a series of eight 
two-stage liquid fuel rockets, the 
first stage being an ex-German 
V-2, the upper stage a W AC-Cor- 
poral rocket developed in Cali- 
fornia. The upper stage reached 
a total altitude of 250 miles. It 
cannot be said that actual satel- 
lite plans of any kind existed at 
the time. A few years earlier 
Arthur C. Clarke had suggested 



86 



GALAXY 



the possibility of “Extra-terres- 
trial Relays”, as he called them, 
in an article in the British Mag- 
azine Wireless World. These re- 
lays were three satellites in the 
24-hour orbit — three “syncoms” 
as they would now be called. But 
this was mainly a suggestion 
pointing out what might be done 
in the future, it was not a detail- 
ed plan. I am hanpy to report 
that Arthur C. Clarke, after the 
first actual communications satel- 
lites had been put into orbit, re- 
ceived the Gold Medal of the 
Franklin Institute for his sug- 
gestion. 

But the actual satellite plans 
came several years later, around 
19.53. Wernher von Braun’s con- 
cept of a wheel-shaped manned 
space station received most of 
the publicity. I devoted two 
columns to the space station con- 
cept (April and May 1953 and 
then again in December 1962). 
It is still a good concept and I 
feel still confident that we’ll build 
a space station of this kind at 
about the time of the first band- 
ing on the moon or soon after- 
wards. The first satellite project 
that was actually carried out, 
though with endless delay and 
countless heartaches, was, of 
course. Project Vanguard, to 
which the column in the Sep- 
tember, 1956 issue was devoted. 

The first astronomical discov- 
ery after Galaxy existed was that 



of the twelfth moon of Jupiter 
(J-XII) by Seth B. Nicholson on 
September 29, 1951, before my 
column existed. But it was re- 
ported in my column in the Au- 
gust issue of 1952. In 1954 he 
eighth moon of Jupiter (J-VIII) 
that had been “lost” was re- 
discovered with the aid of high- 
speed computers, but I had to 
pass this one up because I did 
not learn about it until about 
a year later. 

All along I had to keep in 
mind that considerable time 
would go by between the writing 
of a column and its appearance 
on the newsstands. Even when 
Galaxy was still on a monthly 
schedule that time interval was 
seven weeks — and seven weeks 
would have required a special 
effort on the part of everybody, 
a twelve week interval was clos- 
er to normal. Hence I was never 
able to pay much attention to 
“nev/s” for by the time they could 
have appeared in Galaxy every- 
body had read about them. That 
long interval between writing 
and publication caused a few 
other complications too. Once, 
for example. I had prepared a 
piece on new manipulating de- 
vices, steel fingers that could not 
only handle red-hot metal or 
strongly radioactive substances 
but could also perform feats of 
strength simultaneously if their 
operator desired. I had even ob-

tained a set of half a dozen pho- 
tographs. But about three days 
before sending the material to 
the editor, Life Magazine devoted 
several of its pages to the same 
device, needless to say with color 
pictures. If I had gone ahead 
with my own piece it would have 
been the coldest of cold hash (or 
at least would have looked that 
way) so I put my photographs 
away for filing and wrote a dif- 
ferent column in a hurry. 

'T^he fact that Galaxy is not a 
weekly — for which I am 
quite grateful, otherwise — also 
saw to it that a few articles never 
got written at all. There was one 
I remember: a nice thorough 

piece on communications satel- 
lites, carefully explaining their 
purpose, the way they worked, 
the orbits they should be in and 
so forth. By the time I had block- 
ed out the piece itself and made 
a few diagrams. Echo I was put 
into orbit and was clearly visible 
to everybody. Now this required 
an additional section on “passive” 
communications satellites, those 
that only reflect radio waves 
without amplifying them. Natur- 
ally I had to wait for some re- 
sults, nobody was quite sure at 
the moment how the perform- 
ance of the early and naturally 
primitive “active” communica- 
tions satellites would compare 
with that of the much bigger, 



though “passive” Echo satellite. 

By the time such results be- 
came known, another active com- 
munications satellite had been 
thrown into orbit. Always keep in 
mind that I could not just wait, 
I still had to produce a column 
per issue and sometimes a sub- 
ject needed two successive col- 
umns. So the article on communi- 
cations satellites languished while 
other columns (equally interest- 
ing, I hope) saw the light of 
day. By the time I looked at my 
folder on this subject again, Tel- 
star I was orbited, got front page 
articles everyplace and a double- 
spread in Life. Then I gave up, 
by now communications satellites 
had become so thoroughly known 
to the public that there was no 
use wasting space in Galaxy on 
them. 

The same story was repeated 
at a somewhat later date with 
masers and lasers. To my knowl- 
edge this is the first time these 
words are mentioned in my col- 
umn, but once they were intend- 
ed to be a column. But the 
maser-laser story exhibited a 
strong kinship to the behavior of 
the mythological Hydra. Cut off 
one head and two new ones will 
grow. This is a gratifying thing 
as far as progress is concerned, 
but it can prevent a man from 
finishing an article he had in 
mind. 

While I could not hope to keep

up with a rapidly developing 
story, such as the space age with 
its hundreds of satellites, dozens 
of space probes and multiple 
spurts of development in all pos- 
sible directions, an addition to an 
older discovery is often a fine 
starting point for a survey. This 
is especially the case if the older 
discovery is of the cliff-hanger 
type, of which Latimeria was the 
prime example of the first half 
of the twentieth century. 

A few days before Christmas, 
1938, a very strange fish had 
been brought ashore by a com- 
mercial fishing vessel at the port 
of East London on the east coast 
of South Africa. The fish was 
large-mouthed, bright blue in 
color, about four and a half feet 
long and had strangely shaped, 
very powerful fins. The captain 
of the trawler had never seen 
anything like this and neither had 
Miss M. Courtenay-Latimer, the 
curator of the local museum. She 
wrote to Professor J. L. B. Smith 
at Rhodes University in Gra- 
hamstown. South Africa, who was 
an expert on the marine fishes 
of the area. But there were de- 
lays, when Prof. Smith finally 
got to East London, the internal 
organs of the fish had to be 
thrown out for very natural rea- 
sons — by now Miss Courtenay- 
Latimer would probably be able 
to drop it into a tank of liquid 



nitrogen and keep it, intestinal 
bacteria and all, nearly indefin- 
itely. What was left was enough 
to convince Prof. Smith that a 
most unusual discovery had been 
made. It was one of the fishes 
known to paleontologists as coe- 
lacanth, a group that had been 
believed to be extinct for at least 
50 million years. 

The discovery was exciting for 
more than one reason. It was not 
only a “long extinct” form, it was 
also unusual in being much larger 
than any coelacanth known. The 
fossils usually measured only 
eight inches in length. A twelve- 
inch coelacanth was a big one 
and one incomplete fossil indi- 
cated an over-all length of twen- 
ty inches. The living version was 
fifty-five inches long, which had 
been the main reason why Prof. 
Smith had been doubtful about 
the sketch that had been enclos- 
ed in the letter he had received 
from Miss Courtenay-Latimer. 
The shape had suggested coela- 
canth and nothing else, but the 
measurements had spoken against 
that conclusion. (After the Sec- 
ond World War was over, a 
sixty-inch fossil coelacanth came 
to light in West Germany.) 

Professor Smith named the 
fish Latimeria chalumnae, the 
species name was derived from 
the name of the river that emp- 
ties into the ocean at East Lon- 
don. Naturally he wanted a fresh

specimen. But he ran into two 
kinds of trouble. The first one 
was that the Second World War 
was underway and most people 
had other worries than supposed- 
ly extinct fishes, no matter how 
rare and how important to 
science. The second was that 
Smith had distributed his thou- 
sands of leaflets with a picture 
of the fish, a description and an 
offer of reward, in the wrong 
area. It so happens that the first 
specimen caught had strayed 
southward from its normal habi- 
tat by about 1,800 miles. Nor- 
mally it can be found around the 
Comores Islands and the second 
specimen was found there, again 
just before Christmas, in 1952. 

Now, that the normal habitat 
was known, the waiting time 
shrank; the third specimen was 
caught in September 1953 and 
the fourth in January 1954. Since 
the Comore Islands are French, 
French scientists took over and 
published preliminary reports on 
their observations and then a 
reasonably comprehensive popu- 
lar report became possible. It ap- 
peared in the May, 1956, issue of 
Galaxy. 

'"T^he year 1954 did not only 
bring additional information 
on the fish Latimeria, it also solv- 
ed, in a rather unexpected man- 
ner, an older puzzle. During the 
years from 1908 to 1915 fossil 



bones had been found in southern 
England, near a place called Pilt- 
down. In the end they produced 
a human skull, hailed as one of 
the earliest inhabitants of Eng- 
land named Eoanthropus daw- 
sonii, or Dawson’s Dawn Man. 

In 1954 British paleontologists 
proved conclusively that the 
Dawn Man had been a hoax. The 
upper part of the skull actually 
was human and even fossil, but 
not particularly old. Now, that it 
is known what it is one may say 
of it that it does not present 
either a puzzle nor an insight. 
The lower jaw was the hoax, it 
was the jaw of an ape, almost 
certainly of an Orang-Utan. The 
whole jaw had been made to look 
and feel fossil with considerable 
skill and especially the teeth had 
been filed and otherwise treated 
to lose their pronounced apish 
character and to look like the 
worn teeth of a primitive human. 

It must have been the work of 
many months to accomplish this 
and one can only wonder why 
some people devote so much 
work and so much skill to such 
agob. If a painter spends a year 
painting a “lost old master” and 
another year in “aging” the 
painting so that he can sell it at 
a high price his behavior is un- 
-ethical, despicable and criminal; 
but one can at least see the rea- 
son! But whoever changed the 
Orang-Utan jaw around neither

reaped reward nor questionable 
fame. 

Of course it had been just the 
combination of a fairly modern 
skulltop and a most primitive- 
looking lower jaw which had 
made Piltdown man such a scien- 
tific puzzle. As soon as the fact 
that it was a forgery had been 
published, I started reading up 
on everything that had been writ- 
ten about Piltdown man while it 
was believed to be genuine. 

I could do most of this read- 
ing at home because my library 
is full of books on paleontology; 
a recent count revealed that I 
own more books on paleontology 
than on rockets, missiles and 
space travel — due. no doubt, to 
the fact that paleontologists have 
been around for a much longer 
time than space scientists and 
had more time to write. At any 
event, the results were surpris- 
ing. The French authors I con- 
sulted usually made short shift 
of Piltdown man, just mention- 
ing the characteristics and end- 
ing up with: “more investigation 
is necessary”. In retrospect this 
almost sounds as if they were 
suspicious, but they probably 
were just puzzled. An Austrian 
expert. Prof. Othenio Abel, de- 
voted a great deal of space to 
Piltdown man, but ended up 
with precisely the same sentence, 
though in another language. 
British authors tried hard to fit 



Piltdown man in with other fossil 
humans and pre-humans, hut 
naturally without any good re- 
sult. German authors did the 
same and one or two of them 
voiced a suspicion. It was not 
the suspicion of forgery (nobody 
thought of that) but possibly it 
was a fossil ohne Beweiskraft, a 
fossil that did not prove anything. 
What they did was to ponder 
the possibility that Piltdown 
man, when alive, had not been 
typical of its tribe but had been 
a freak. 

If one started with the lower 
jaw one should expect a some- 
what smaller skullcap of differ- 
ent built. But possiblv just this 
individual had an abnormally 
large (for its type) skull. This 
did not necessarily make him a 
genius: even now a moron oc- 
casionally has an extra large 
brain, a brain that is voluminous 
'but fails to function properly Or 
else, beginning with the skull and 
considering the skull as normal 
for its type, we had the bad luck 
to find the remains of an indi- 
vidual with a lower jaw that was 
a throwback to a much earlier 
type. Maybe, if the whole skele- 
ton were known, some other de- 
formities would be found. 

The write-ups of Piltdown man 
showed an extraordinary expen- 
diture of words like “perhaps”, 
“possibly”, “if one assumes”, and 
so forth — quite naturally be-

cause the fossil in question was 
not genuine, as finally proved by 
the two British experts. But Pilt- 
down man never had a column 
devoted to him and I no longer 
remember why not. I had all of 
the material available, most of 
it even at home. I can only con- 
clude that something else which 
I considered to be of more in- 
terest to my readers got in the 
way at the time. Or possibly I 
felt that it had been sufficiently 
covered elsewhere — people who 
do articles for science-fiction 
magazines are always aware that 
their readers read many other 
journals too. 

\ nybody who sits back think- 
ing about the scientific dis- 
coveries of the last fifteen years 
is likely to fall into the trap of 
believing that most of them were 
due to the space effort. True, 
the space effort is responsible for 
a number of them, among them 
things nobody expected to find, 
but this fifteen year period also 
produced great strides elsewhere. 
Not even all the astronomical 
discoveries are due to the space 
effort. 

Very early in 1956 — and the 
active space age began late in 
1957 if a reminder of the date 
should be necessary — Dr. Ger- 
ard P. Kuiper pointed out that 
the unusual orbit of Pluto could 
best be explained by assuming 



that Pluto is a “run-away moon” 
of Neptune. (The same sugges- 
tion had been made in 1936 by 
R. R. Lyttleton in England but 
had failed to attract much atten- 
tion.) This was an item I ex- 
pected to remain confined to as- 
tronomical journals, hence it was 
written up in the column for the 
August 1956 issue. 

Another astronomical discov- 
ery was made in the process of 
being accomplished at the same 
time by the discoverer of Pluto, 
Dr. Clyde W. Tombaugh. But 
this one was connected with the 
space age. That there would be 
artificial satellites soon, and prob- 
ably both Russian and American, 
was certain in 1955. Of course 
they would have to be tracked 
and one man even assumed that 
our military men intended to 
track the Russian satellites some- 
what more carefully than our 
own. But there was a possible 
problem, hadn’t there been a 
number of reports, never con- 
firmed to be sure, about small 
satellites of earth? If they really 
existed they would confuse the 
trackers. The thing to do was to 
establish the orbits of such minor 
satellites, if they existed. 

Clyde W. Tombaugh proposed 
a method for such a search and 
designed the necessary instru- 
mentation which was not only 
small enough to be carried on a 
truck, but sensitive enough (in 



92 



GALAXY 



a phrase that was to become 
famous) “to detect a white ten- 
nis ball in orbit a hundred miles 
from the surface, and a V-2 
rocket, if painted white, at the 
distance of the moon.” In 1957 
his report was out, and I could 
tell of the results of the search 
in my column for the July, 1957, 
issue. The result had been nega- 
tive, there were no minor satel- 
lites of earth so that anything 
that could be detected and track- 
ed had to be artificial. 

Two other astronomical dis- 
coveries also have no direct con- 
nection with the space age. One 
is the diseovery of the mysterious 
“quasi-stellar objects”, something 
that was quickly shortened to 
“quasars” without improving our 
understanding of them. The dis- 
covery of the quasars was the 
result of radio astronomy. And 
the most recent discovery, an- 
nounced only four days prior to 
my writing this, is the result of 
using radar techniques. It is the 
discovery that planet Mercury 
does not have a period of rota- 
tion of 88 days, as Giovanni Vir- 
ginio Schiaparelli had announced 
in 1889. The orbital period is 88 
days and Schiaparelli’s announce- 
ment therefore meant that Mer- 
cury always points the same 
hemisphere toward the earth. The 
outcome of Schiaparelli’s an- 
nouncement had been several 
fascinating concepts: the scorch- 



ed “brightside” with puddles of 
molten lead and tin, the perma- 
nently frozen “darkside” where 
the remains of the former atmo- 
sphere of the planet lay frozen 
on the ground and, last but not 
least, the interesting “twilight 
belt” where the sun appeared 
above the horizon for a few days 
every 88 days. 

XTow it is known that Mercury 
^ rotates a little faster than 
once every 88 days, the preli- 
minary figure is 65 days. But 
that means that the sun shines 
on every part of Mercury’s sur- 
face for a fairly long time. No 
more permanently nearly red-hot 
brightside, no more permanently 
frozen darkside. And no more 
twilight belt. Mercury is still a 
most inhospitable planet, but it 
has lost the distinctive features 
we thought were there. 

Of course some of the major 
discoveries are the outcome of 
putting instruments into space. 
The first big discovery was that 
of the inner Van Allen belt in 
1958, accomplished by Explorer I, 
the first American artificial satel- 
lite which, incidentally, is still in 
orbit. Later the outer Van Allen 
belt was found by another space 
device. Then we have the first 
determination of the thickness of 
the cloud layer of Venus, its in- 
credible height above the surface 
of Venus and the measurement

of the very high surface temper- 
ature of the planet, all carried 
out by Mariner II. We have the 
very sharp and detailed photo- 
graphic close-ups of the surface 
of the moon, produced by Ran- 
gers VII, VIII and IX. And by 
the time you read this we may 
have some nice close-up photo- 
graphs of Mars, transmitted over 
more than sixty million miles of 
space by Mariner IV. 

Some of the very important 
discoveries other than space can 
only be mentioned here: increas- 
ed (though still fragmentary) 
understanding of the inner struc- 
ture of the atom; vastly increas- 
ed understanding (not yet quite 
complete) of the basic mechan- 
ism of life and especially of here- 
dity; and the interesting and 
completely unexpected discovery 
that at least the heaviest ones of 
the so-called noble gases, namely 
xenon and krypton, will form 
chemical compounds, in spite of 



what every chemical handbook 
has said for the last half century. 

But many of the mysteries 
that were written up at one time 
or another in my column, are 
still mysteries. Of the clouds of 
Venus, we now know the extent, 
but we still don’t know their 
chemical composition, though the 
top layer seems to consist of ice 
crystals. The Red Spot of Jupiter 
is still unexplained, the Gegen- 
schein is still a mystery in spite 
of (or rather because of) four 
different explanations. We still 
don’t know when and how ball 
lightning will form. And the large 
rotating “luminous wheels” of the 
Indian Ocean certainly need 
more investigation. And I refuse 
to think about quasars until more 
is known. • 

I suspect, however, that the 
majority of these mysteries will 
have been explained, not another 
fifteen years from now but in 
about five years. — WILLY LEY

Trouble with those blue bugs 
was they didn't hurt you . 
they did something far worse/ 



S o now Irma will be at me to 
do something about them 
blue bugs. I got to do something 
about Irma. 

Dr. West is wise too, as good as 
said so when him and Judge Van 
Anda was in today for a couple 
beers. Pity Dr. West is not the 
doctoring type doctor but just 
has letters and stuff. Sort of ex- 
plorer people say, account of his 
Independent Income, gone for 
months till the town’s forgot him 
and then he turns up full of what 
the buU was done with. 

I don’t think the Judge knows 
about the blue bugs. If they bit 
him like they done me he’d never 
go to dreaming, not him up there. 



six feet five, (looking back at 
what he thinks the world used to 
be. Still if you was old like him, 
you might want big dreams more 
than ever, about being young. 

If you could te/I them bugs, if 
you could name your own dream! 
No way, I guess. I take the 
dreams I can get. 

Dr. West certainly knows 
something. I’d no sooner drawed 
them beers when he starts men- 
tioning mice. I told him, Look, I 
said, you do not see the Health 
Department climbing all over my 
back the way they would if I had 
mice. He asks me, so what is that 
hole in the floor below tlie liquor 
shelves? I had to make like hunt- 



95 



ing for it, and act surprised. 
Knothole, I says. Oh, knothole, 
he says, knothole the regal twin- 
cushioned back of my lap, how 
come a knothole in linoleum? So 
I had to say it could be mice. 
Judge Van Anda says Ha. 

I went down the bar to pass the 
time with Lulu who doesn’t 
get much business in the after- 
noon because the light is too 
strong. Lulu is like blonde this 
week. If only I could tell the 
bugs to put Lulu into a dream 
with me! The only time they 
done it she turned into Irma. I 
can’t figure that. 

What if Lulu got bit and had 
some dreams herself? 

I suppose Irma thinks I mar- 
ried her so I can’t do nothing 
without she comes clomping in 
onto it? If she’s solid gold why 
don’t she move to Fort Knox? 

I had not hardly started talk- 
ing to Lulu when Dr. West goes 
to booming. Desolation, he says, 
do you think you know what 
desolation is? It’s the sub-Arctic 
tundra, he says, and me alone 
in that borrowed Cessna that 
might’ve got its engine tuned 
three or four months earlier, and 
no reason to be there except my 
itch to see more of the poor 
wonderful planet before they 
blow it up. Lulu, what do you 
think? What do you say desola- 
tion is? 



Oh, she says, maybe the Sta- 
dium, game over, crowd gone and 
you know, empty popcorn bags 
and match cards and spit. 

You, Al? he says to me. What’s 
desolation? 

I said, oh, maybe a dark night 
and nobody shows you where to 
go. I believe Dr. West is sad in 
his heart in spite of that educa- 
tion which is over my head. It 
would be like him to take off in a 
borrowed plane for the flat side of 
nowhere. * I like to watch him 
standing by Judge Van Anda 
who he is always telling siddown 
siddown and the Judge merely 
says Ha. I can feel sad without 
no Independent Income. I am 42 
and I have this ulcer. 

The tundra, says Dr. West — 
a nothing of dun colors, rotting 
snow, and you wonder when the 
whole earth will look like that. 

No! says Lulu about to cry. 
Don’t talk thataway! 

Never mind, chicken, he says, 
I was just bleating. 

S uppose you took Irma to this 
here Tundra and told her to 
walk home. Flies, she says last 
night, flies all over you and you 
drunk as a pig. God, I pretty near 
shut her up for good. But she just 
don’t know no better. She don’t 
have too much of a life with a 
busted-down hack like me that 
couldn’t even last five rounds 
with Willie Donohue.

GALAXY 



Dr. West went on about bor- 
rowing a plane from a friend has 
got this lodge in the north woods, 
and flying over the tundra till he 
saw like a blue spark down there. 
Landed and picked up the ob- 
ject, size and shape of a basket- 
ball he said, not really blue, more 
like daylight split and turned a 
million ways. It hummed when 
he held it to his ear. That’s when 
he broke off to ask me is there a 
basement under this part of the 
bar. 

He knows damn well it’s got no 
basement. He was in town when 
I got this addition added on. Al- 
ready a cellar under the main 
part, I didn’t need another, got 
this part done with merely the 
footing and concrete under the 
lino, I mean if there is any exca- 
vation in forty miles Dr. West 
will be there watching. It’s the 
people with an Independent In- 
come or them with not any that 
get the excavation watched. Guys 
like me that work for a living, we 
are up that creek with a little bity 
plastic spoon and no breeze. 
All’s I said was Hell no, this 
here is an addition was added on, 
it’s got no basement. 

Unless somebody walled it off 
on you, says Judge Van Anda. 
You won’t find a better way to 
dispose of a body, the Judge 
says, that’s if you have time and 
materials and don’t mind the 
labor. Well, the Judge is retired 



after forty years on what they 
call the bench, and keeps saying 
with his experience he ought to 
write detective stories. Yes sir, he 
says, if the walling off has been 
done right, proper pains taken, 
you can give the whole thing a 
very attractive finish. I guess he 
meant the wall. You never know, 
with the Judge. I must of said 
to him a hundred times. Look, 
I’ve said, the surprising type 
things that have happened to me, 
you ought to put them into a 
book if you’re going to write one. 
He just goes hrrm hrrm and Ha. 

I hated him sounding off about 
bodies that way, account of Lu- 
lu’s nerves. Before Dr. West be- 
gun his story Lulu was talking 
to me about that murderer over 
to Lincolnsville, the one that 
done in his whole family with a 
kitchen knife, and the shooting 
down in Jonesburg a couple 
weeks ago. She was real nerved 
up. His whole family, and with a 
plain kitchen knife. When the 
cops come for him — Jesus, he 
was like asleep, it said. Lulu takes 
the news pretty personal, it’s the 
woman of it. 

T^r. West’s little blue eyes — 
why, damn, they’re near 
the same color as my bugs, like 
sky with the sun caught in it. 

Maybe the bugs are something 
new to science that Dr. West has 
to keep top secret? Then this 



A BETTER MOUSEHOLE 



97 



tundra story would be the edu- 
cated crappola he’s obliged to 
shovel over it? His eyes are 
bloodshot like mine have been 
getting the last few weeks. I been 
losing weight too and it ain’t my 
ulcer. The blood the bugs take 
out couldn’t make no such differ- 
ence, and them so gentle — I 
float off into the dreams almost 
as soon as they come settle on 
me. 

I’d give anything to have an- 
other dream where Irma is like 
when we got married, not bony 
and mean but soft, brown hair 
with all them goldy lights, voice 
like country cream. 

When Dr. West quit talking 
Lulu was crying. She says she 
feels sometimes like everything 
was on top of her, usually goes 
to the Ladies and comes back 
with a rebuilt mouth and a fresh 
bounce to her. Lulu could put 
her shoes in my trunk any time. 
She ain’t had a real happy life. 

Aw, who does? For young peo- 
ple it’s always a maybe-tomor- 
row, for the rest, it’s where-did- 
everything-go? The Judge, he 
should be happy looking across 
all them years of playing God 
and sticking people in jail? Dr. 
West never married, chases 
moonblink over the world with 
his Independent Income, but 
once he told me what he honestly 
craved was hearth and home, nice 
woman to warm his slippers and 



his bed, only a devil in him 
couldn’t ever let him rest. And 
I have this ulcer. 

The Bible or somebody says if 
you build a better mousetrap 
they’ll like put you on teevy. 
All’s I got is a better mousehole. 
What do they give you for that? 

Dr. West waited till Lulu come 
back from the Ladies to go on 
with his story. He wasn’t telling 
it for her, though, spite of her 
coming to sit on the stool by him 
and give him a feel or two for 
friendship’s sake. Not for the 
Judge neither. It was for me and 
that hole in the floor. I could 
of told him they never come out 
till I close the bar and dim the 
lights. 

He said he smuggled the blue 
ball home, not a word to anyone. 
As a story it wasn’t nothing, 
which is one reason I can’t be- 
lieve he was making it up. He 
kept calling the thing a sphere. I 
always thought a sphere was 
some type musical instrument. 

"I l^hen he says home he means 
^ ’ the ram-and-shackle man- 
sion at the edge of town with

Rock Hill and Johnny Blood rat- 
tling around in the mansion being

months vacation to this sister 
in Maine who has been trying 
to make Johnny come to Jesus 
anyhow thirty-forty years, only 
when Johnny hears that special 
tone of voice he shuts the good 
eye and lets go with something 
from this Shakespeare. 

I wish I had the education to 
make with Shakespeare when 
Irma is at me about talking to 
Lulu or drinking up the profits 
which I never could do with this 
ulcer unless I would drop dead, 
she never thinks of that, or why 
don’t I at least try to earn 
enough we would spend winters 
in Florida if I had any zing. 

Sent Johnny away, he says, 
and kept the sphere at room tem- 
perature. Dr. West is always 
talking thataway. A room don’t 
run a temperature, or if he 
means hot like some room what’s 
so scientific if somebody mon- 
keys with the thermostack or 
leaves the God-damn door open? 

Winter in Florida for Christ’s 
sake. 

The blue thing hatched one 
night after he’d gone to bed — 
except he says it was not an 
egg but a figure of speech. He 
found the two halves in the 
morning not chipped like a hatch- 
ed egg, just separated, like they’d 
been fitted together originally so 
good you couldn’t find the joint. 
Nothing else disturbed, but a hole 
in the window-screen that look- 



ed like it was melted through, 
the ends of copper wire fused 
so the hole looked like a grom- 
met. 

Judge Van Anda asked him 
did he keep the busted eggshell. 
Dr. West says. Now I did try to 
make it plain it was not an egg, 
nor do I know why I waste my 
experiences on you, like when I 
showed that comb my mermaid 
gave me it could of been a paper 
clip, all the impression it made. 
So it could, says the Judge kind 
of brisk, seeing they make such 
combs in Bridgeport and you can 
buy them in any drugstore for 
upwards of nineteen cents plus 
tax. All right, says Dr. West, so 
if she did happen on it in the 
billows off Bridgeport, God damn 
it, she gave it to me, didn’t she? 
Oh, don’t get red-eyed about it, 
says Judge Van Anda. 

I ’m not, says Dr. West. Al’s the 
one with bloodshot eyes, late 
hours likely. He was watching 
me real sharp. No sir, you too, 
Sid, says the Judge, you look in 
the mirror you’ll see you’re red- 
eyed like a weasel, I snow you 
not. Now if you could have 
brought home just one mermaid 
scale. And Dr. West says they do 
not have scales, no more reason 
to have scales than a seal or a 
whale or any other ocean-dwell- 
ing mammal. Ocean-dwelling 
mahooha, says Judge Van Anda. 



A BETTER MOUSEHOLE

And I suppose, says Dr. West, 
back there ninety-six years ago 
in the little red schoolhouse the 
only biology you ever learned 
was out in the bushes during re- 
cess. Which was a friendly re- 
mark because the Judge could 
go hrrm reminding himself how 
he wants you to think he used 
to be. All the same I quick took 
them another round of beers. 

Lulu says, You got out of that 
too easy. Doc. I remember she 
pushed her shoulders back show- 
ing what she has got. She could 
put her shoes in my trunk any 
time. She says, Do you still have 
the eggshell or do you don’t? 

I do not, says Dr. West. I do 
not still possess the two halves 
of that vehicle. 

Well excuse me for living, says 
Lulu, but she wasn’t mad. She 
likes everybody, you could call 
it a weakness. 

And why don’t you? says the 
Judge. As if I didn’t know. 

Because, says Dr. West, I car- 
ried them outdoors to see them 
in the sun, was disturbed by the 
telephone, set them down in a 
thicket, answered the phone, at 
which you bent my ear for a 
half-hour about a detective story 
you plan to start writing any 
day. When I got back the two 
halves were gone. 

Naturally, says the Judge. Na- 
turally. 

Gone, says Dr. West, from a 



patch of soft earth in the thicket 
that showed no footprints. 

We left it at that. Ever since, 
I been thinking about it. Only 
minutes now till closing time or 
I would flip my lid. 

Dr. West was not lying or he 
would of done a mermaid story. 
That don’t mean it was the whole 
truth. How could anybody ever 
tell that like they say in the 
law courts? Maybe the bugs bit 
him before they went off through 
the hole in the screen? One bite 
would be enough to show him 
what it does to you. Could we 
sort of share them? 

I would like that. Something’s 
gentled me down lately. I got 
no jealousy about him and Lulu 
going off together like they done 
this afternoon. I don’t seem to 
have no angry feelings of no 
kind except about drowning Irma 
in the bathtub if it was practi- 
cal. Aw, I guess I mean I might 
make that type joke, a man 
couldn’t do no such thing. Be- 
sides it could be my fault Irma 
is like she is. How about that, 
Al? 

Anyhow I’d sooner Lulu went 
off with Dr. West than with say 
this salesman looks like a shaved 
pig and wants a beer. 

Beer. Why can’t they ask for 
something unusual just once so I 
would have to think about it 
and stop thinking?

GALAXY 



Five minutes still to closing. 

It was last night Irma found 
me with my bugs and called 
them flies. I bet she believes 
that. It was the finest part of my 
dream — gone, clobbered, and 
here’s Irma in her nightgown 
come down and turned on the 
light, standing there all bones 
and bad temper saying Drunk as 
a pig, now I see where the profits 
go, all down your gut. Her that 
used to talk like a lady, and had 
them goldy lights in her hair. 
Flies, she says, flies everywhere. 

She don’t know about the hole, 
my better mousehole, or she 
would of poured cleaning fluid 
down it, and they would of come 
out and fixed her little red wag- 
on. I would not like that to hap- 
pen. It’s funny how gentle I feel 
nowadays. I used to be what they 
call a Ruffed Diamond. 

I guess Irma will have took 
her twenty-year grouch to bed 
bv now. Oh no, it wasn’t like that 
all of them twenty years, not by 
no means — but my Jesus, I’m 
sunnosed to be some damn God- 
nlmighty Apollo Valentino Rock- 
efeller or I’m no good? I’m good 
in them dreams. I been seven 
feet tall and bronzy, ready when- 
ever T said so. 

There they go again about that 
thing in Tonesburg where the 
lady shot up a radio-teevy store 
account she claimed the noise 
spoiled her dreams. Look — 



things like that — it can’t mean 
these bugs are — 

I won’t have a dream tonight 
though. I won’t, till I can get a 
real talk with Dr. West. Well, 
speak of the — 

ft has come to be morning, hot 
and quiet outside in that gold- 
en street. I better try to think 
through what happened, and 
what Dr. West said. 

When he come in at closing 
time I seen he wanted talk same 
as me. I told him stick around, I 
closed up, doused the front 
lights, we carried a Jameson into 
the back room. He flung down a 
shot and said, I took Lulu up 
to my place. The Judge too. 
Johnny Blood’ll be gone another 
couple weeks, but I suppose may- 
be the Judge’ll be missed. 
Missed? I says. 

He says, Don’t be like that, ,A1. 
The Judge is asleep and dream- 
ing, Lulu is asleep and dream- 
ing, and don’t you go acting sur- 
prised on me, because I come 
back to talk to you. Beat-up 
crocks like you and me, Al, he 
says, we’re into middle age, we 
can wait a mite longer for our 
dreams, seeing we’ve spent mor’n 
half a lifetime doing not much 
else. 

While I poured him another 
he said, it was Lulu brought 
them back to me. I asked him 
how come. 



A BETTER MOUSEHOLE

She didn’t do anything, he 
says, she’s just overweight with a 
big blood pressure. They like 
that. They must need the blood, 
maybe to help them breed. Only 
a couple dozen came out of that 
sphere, but now they might have 
several colonies. I wasn’t quite 
truthful, he says — I saw them 
come out, and a few of them 
flew around me with things in 
the fifth pair of limbs that look- 
ed like weapons. While I held 
still because of that, one of them 
bit me and I dreamed a journey 
to Alpha Centauri. 

Maybe, he says, they always 
do it merely to hold us quiet so 
they can drink. Maybe it’s from 
lovingkindness. 

I asked if it was true what 
he’d told us about the halves of 
the shell disappearing. Yes, he 
said, and he said that afterward 
he went searching and grieving 
all over till one night he caught 
a bluish gleam up on Ragged 
Rock Hill. He went to it, work- 
ing his way through the trees 
with a flashlight to where he 
thought it had showed, and set- 
tled down to wait. Sure enough 
they came and gave him a 
dream. It breaks his heart too, 
the way a man can’t name his 
own. 

''T^hey come for Lulu. AU we 
did, he says, we turned off 
the lights and set by the open 

102 



window. Coming for Lulu be- 
cause she’s right for them, they 
took care of the Judge too, and 
me. My dream was a short one, 
Al. I don’t have much blood in 
me. 

He put down another Jame- 
son while I told him what I been 
going through. He stepped over 
to one of the other back-room 
booths to pick something off the 
floor. He’s a noticing restless 
man. Just a buckle like a gold 
rosebud off of a girl’s shoe. The 
back room gets lively Saturday 
nights, and I ain’t been sweeping 
up too good, last couple-three 
weeks. Only light I turned on for 
us was the 25-watt bulb in our 
booth with the pink shade — Irma 
chose them shades. They’re real 
nice. You won’t find no God- 
damn interior desecrator that’s 
got taste like hers. Dr. West set 
there playing with that gold rose- 
bud and going slow on his Jame- 
son while I talked. 

And I asked him, where do 
they come from? 

Oh, he says, outer space, where 
else? He was turning the buckle 
in and out of the light, reflecting 
a glow into the drink itself, a 
kind of glory. And he says, or 
else inner space. 

I asked him did he think the 
bugs had anything to do with 
them killings. He just wiggled his 
shoulders. 

That’s when I said. Look, 
GALAXY 



couldn’t my Irma have a dream? 
He give me no answer. I says, 
maybe it would change how she 
acts and feels about some things? 

Maybe, he says. We don’t 
know, he says, we don’t know 
much of anything. More we 
know, better we get at asking 
questions we can’t answer. Then 
he poured himself another Jame- 
son and after a while I went up- 
stairs. 

Irma wasn’t asleep. When I 
touched her shoulder she says, 
God give me patience! and 
flounces clear acrost the bed. I 
says, Irma, honey, I ain’t after 
you thataway, I just want you 
should come down talk some- 
thing over with I and Doc West. 
West? she says. That dirty old 
man? What for? 

I says, Irma, this is special, 
you give me lip I’m big enough 
to make you. You get up and 
fling some clothes on and you 
take that God-damn cold cream 
off your face and come down. 
All’s we want is have a couple 
drinks, talk something over. 

V^e//, she says, aren’t we the 
^ ^ lord and master all of a 
sudden! You goddam right, I 
says, and get going. I didn’t say 
that mean, nor she didn’t take it 
mean, just wiped the guck off her 
face as meek as anything, put 
on slippers, and a bathrobe over 
her p-js, and come along. In the 



light of the upstairs hall I seen 
some of them goldy lights, I 
know I did. 

Dr. West had laid his head on 
his arms. Small he was, and 
clean as a dry stick, I don’t know 
why she would call him a dirty 
old man. He hadn’t finished his 
Jameson. I thought he was hav- 
ing a dream, for the bugs had 
eome, but he looked up and said, 
I brought it on us, I brought it 
on the world. I and some other 
billions, he said. I don’t under- 
stand what he meant by that. 

Irma seen the bugs and she 
screamed. Only five-six of them, 
nothing scary. I put my arms 
around her to gentle her. Irma, 
I says, all they do is give you 
beautiful dreams. I want you 
should have some like I’ve had. 
Let ’em bite a little, it don’t 
hurt. But she screamed and tried 
to fight me off. She said, I don’t 
want to, I just want — I just 
want — 

I didn’t listen. So hell-bent 
she should have dreams like 
mine, I didn’t listen. The way 
she was perking around, the p-js 
got twisted away from her little 
breasts, and I just hung on, too 
lame-brain dumb for anything 
else. Them little things is like 
when she was a girl, I used to 
kid her about what would the 
babies eat, only we never could 
have any. One bug lit there, and 
I just held her — why, them bites 



A BETTER MOUSEHOLE 



103 



don’t hurt, I got a hundred onto 
me, they don’t even itch. 

She didn’t scream again. I felt 
a shock go through her and she 
said. Oh, oh, oh, a kind of cry- 
ing like what I used to hear in 
bed, and her with a voice like 
country cream. The bug flew off. 
I found her mouth and kissed 
her. Her face sagged away from 
me and she was dead. 

I think Dr. West said, your 
little lady, she’s asleep? 

I carried her over to this 
lounge chair, sat here with her. 
I don’t know what to do. I re- 
member Dr. West, he come over 
and stood by us, though I want- 
ed him to go away. I know I said 
something about maybe some 
people just couldn’t have such 
dreams. 

T T e says, maybe it’s that, or 
maybe she dreamed more 
than us, Al. Maybe this thing 
gave her too big a dream for her 
to stand. Dreaming’s a dangerous 
thing, he said, it’s got a dark 
side. If the bugs shoot in some- 
thing that makes the dreaming 
part of us blaze up, the way the 
rest of us can’t take it — 

I told him I wasn’t going to 
try to understand it no more. I 
said I ought to knowed you can’t 
make another person have a 



dream. It’s not right, it’s not 
right some-way. 

Dr. West said more, I can’t 
just bring it back. I think he said, 
dreaming’s not a sickness but it’s 
like one, partly. It made the 
world what it is, different from 
ancient days, and it could un- 
make it. 

I asked him not to notify no 
one, just go away and leave us 
be. 

People will figure the bar is 
closed, they’ll give us a bit of 
time before they start crowding 
in. 

And there was something he 
said about how things might even 
get better with the bugs taking 
over, if that’s what they meant 
to do. I told him I didn’t care 
much about the world, all’s I 
ever wanted was to have a de- 
cent life with work I knowed how 
to do and a nice woman and 
maybe some kids. I guess that’s 
when Dr. West went away. He’s 
just a lonesome little guy trying 
to figure things out, I shouldn’t 
of spoke harsh. 

See, it wasn’t like I was trying 
to make you have my dream. 

You look like you was dream- 
ing. You look real sweet, I meant 
to tell you. I don’t know why I 
couldn’t ever tell you.

I 

CCCtick your left arm straight 
^ forward, Samm,” said 
Folly. 

He stretched his arm out. 

“I can sense it!” cried Folly. 
“Now wiggle your fingers!” 
Samm wiggled them. 

Finstemis said nothing, but 

105 



both of them caught from his 
mind, riding clear and wise be- 
side them, a “sense of the situa- 
tion.” His “sense of the situa- 
tion” could be summed up in the 
one-word comment, which he did 
not need to utter; 

“Foolishness!” 

“It is not foolishness, Finster- 
nis,” cried Folly. “Here are the 



threv! ot us, riding empty space 
millions of kilometers from no- 
where. We are people once, Earth 
people from Old Earth Itself. Is 
it foolish to remember what we 
used to be? I was a woman once. 
A beautiful woman. Now I’m this 
— this thing, bent on a mission of 
murder and destruction. I used to 
have hands myself, real hands. 
Is it wrong for me to enjoy look- 
ing at Samm’s hands now and 
then? To think of the past which 
all three of us have left behind.” 
Finsternis did not answer; his 
mind was blank to both of them. 
There was nothing but space 
around them, not even much 
space dust, and the bluish light 
of Linschoten XV straight ahead. 
From the third planet of that 
star they could occasionally hear 
the cackle and gabble of the 
man-eaters. 

Once again Folly cried to Fin- 
sternis, “Is that so wrong, that I 
should enjoy looking at a hand? 
Samm has well-shaped hands. I 
was a person once, and so were 
you. Did I ever tell you that I 
was a beautiful woman once?” 

S he had been a beautiful wom- 
an once and now she was the 
control of a small spaceship 
which fled across emptiness 
with two grotesque companions. 

She was now a ship only eleven 
meters long and shaped roughly 
like an ancient dirigible. Finster- 



nis was a perfect cube, fifty met- 
ers to the side, packed with ma- 
chinery which could blank out a 
sun and contain its planets until 
they froze to icy, perpetual death. 
Samm was a man, but he was 
a man of flexible steel, two hun- 
dred meters high. He was de- 
signed to walk on any kind of 
planet, with any kind of inhabi- 
tant, with any kind of chemistry 
or any kind of gravity: he was 
designed to bring antagonists, 
whomever they might be, the 
message of the power of man. 
The power of man . followed 
by terror, followed if necessary 
by death. If Samm failed, Fin- 
sternis had the further power of 
blocking out the sun, Linschoten 
XV. If either or both failed. Fol- 
ly had the job of adjusting them 
so that they could win. If they 
had no chance of winning, she 
then had the task of destroying 
Finsternis and Samm, and then 
herself. 

Their instructions were clear: 

“You will not, you will not un- 
der any circumstances return. 
You will not, you will not un- 
der any conditions turn back to- 
ward Earth. You are too danger- 
ous to come anywhere near 
Earth, ever again. You may live 
if you wish. If you can. But you 
must not — repeat not — come 
back. You have your duty. You 
asked for it. Now you have it. 
Do not, come back. Your forms 



106 



GALAXY 



fit your duty. You will do your 
duty.” 

Folly had become a tiny ship, 
crammed with miniaturized 
equipment. 

Finsternis had become a cube 
blacker than darkness itself. 

Samm had become a man. but 
a man different from any which 
had ever been seen on Earth. He 
had a metal body, copied from 
the human form down to the last 
detail. That way the enemies, 
whoever they might be, would be 
given a terrible glimpse of the 
human shape, the human voice. 
Two hundred meters high he 
stood, strong and solid enough to 
fly through space with nothing 
but the jets on his belt. 

The Instrumentality had de- 
signed all three of them. De- 
signed them well. 

Designed them to meet the 
crazy menace out beyond the 
stars, a menace which gave no 
clue to its technology or origin, 
but which responded to the sig- 
nal “man” with the counter-sig- 
nal, “gabble cackle! eat, eat! 
man, man! good to eat! cackle- 
gabble! eat, eat!” 

That was enough. 

The Instrumentality took steps. 
And the three of them — the ship, 
the cube and the metal giant — 
sped between the stars to con- 
quer, to terrorize or to destroy 
the menace which lived on the 
third planet of Linschoten XV. 



Or, if needful, to put out that 
particular sun. 

Folly, who had become a ship, 
wa,- the most volatile of the 
three. 

She had been a beautiful wom- 
an once. 



II 



(,^'% 7'on were a beautiful wom- 
an once,” Samm had said, 
some years before. “How did you 
end up becoming a ship?” 

“I killed myself,” said Folly. 
“That’s why I took this name. 
Folly. I had a long life ahead of 
me, but I killed myself and they 
brought me back at the last min- 
ute. When I found out I Vi/as still 
alive, I volunteered for some- 
thing adventurous, dangerous. 
They gave me this. Well, I 
asked for it, didn’t I?” 

“You asked for it,” said Samm 
gravely. Out in the middle of 
nothing, surrounded by a tre- 
mendous lot of nowhere, courtesy 
was still the lubricant which gov- 
erned human relationships. The 
two of them observed courtesy 
and kindness toward one another. 
Sometimes they threw in a bit of 
humor, too. 

Finsternis did not take part in 
their talk or their companionship. 
He did not even verbalize his 
answers. He merely let them 
know his sense of the situation 
and this time, as in all other 



THREE TO A GIVEN STAR 



107 



times, his response was — “Neg- 
ative. No operation needed. Com- 
munication nonfunctional. Not 
needed here. Silence, please. I kill 
suns. That is all I do. My part is 
my business, not yours. My past 
is my business. All mine.” This 
was communicated in a single 
terrible thought, so that Folly 
and Samm stopped trying to 
bring Finsternis into the conver- 
sations which they started up, ev- 
ery subjective century or so, and 
continued for years at a time. 

Finsternis merely moved along 
with them, several kilometers 
away, but well within their range 
of awareness. But as far as com- 
pany was concerned, Finsternis 
might as well not have been there 
at all. 

Samm went on with the conver- 
sation, the conversation which 
they had had so many hundreds 
of times since the planoform ship 
had discharged them “near” 
Linschoten XV and left them to 
make the rest of their way alone. 
(If the menace were really a 
menace, and if it were intelligent, 
the Instrumentality had no in- 
tention of letting an actual plan- 
oform ship fall within the powers 
of a strange form of life which 
might well be hypnotic in its 
combat capacities. Hence the 
ship, the cube and the giant were 
launched into normal space at 
high velocity, equipped with jets 
to correct their courses, and left 



to make their own away to the 
danger.) 

Samm said, as he always did, 
“You were a beautiful woman. 
Folly, but you wanted to die. 
Why?” 

“Why do people ever want to 
die, Samm? It’s the power in us, 
the vitality which makes us want 
so much. Life always trembles 
on the edge of disappointment. 
If we hadn’t been vital and 
greedy and lustful and yearning, 
if we hadn’t had big thoughts and 
wanted bigger ones, we would 
have stayed animals, like all the 
little things back on Earth. It’s 
strong life that brings us so close 
to death. We can’t stand the 
beauty of it, the nearness of the 
things we want, the remoteness of 
the things that we can have. You 
and me and Finsternis, now, we’re 
monsters riding out between the 
stars. And yet we’re happier now 
than we were when we were back 
among people. I was a beautiful 
woman, but there were specific 
things which I wanted. I wanted 
them myself. I alone. For me. 
Only for me. When I couldn’t 
have them, I wanted to die. If I 
had been stupider or happier I 
might have lived on. But I didn’t. 
I was me — intensely me. So here 
I am. I don’t even know whether 
I have a body or not, inside this 
ship. They’ve got me all hooked 
up to the sensors and the view- 
ers and the computers. Some- 



108 



GALAXY 




times I think that I may be a 
lovely woman still, with a real 
body hidden somewhere inside 
this ship, waiting to step out and 
to be a person again. And you, 
Samm, don’t you want to tell me 
about yourself? Samm. SAMM. 
That’s no name for an actual 
person — Superordinated Alien 
Measuring and Mastery device. 
What were you before they gave 
you that big body? At least you 
still look like a person. You’re 
not a ship, like me.” 

“My name doesn’t matter. Fol- 
ly, and if I told it to you, you 
wouldn’t know it. You never 
knew it.” 

“How wouldn’t I know?” she 
cried. “I’ve never told you my 



name either, so perhaps we did 
know each other back on Old 
Earth when we were still people.” 

C4T can tell something,” said 
Samm, “from the shape of 
words, from the ring of thoughts, 
even when we’re not out here in 
nothing. You were a lady, per- 
haps highborn. You were truly 
beautiful. You were really im- 
portant. And I — I was a tech- 
nician. A good one. I did my 
work and I loved my family, and 
my wife and I were happy with 
every child which the Lords gave 
us for adoption. But my wife died 
first. And after a while my chil- 
dren, my wonderful boy and my 
two beautiful, intelligent girls — 



THREE TO A GIVEN STAR 



109 



my own children, they couldn’t 
stand me anymore. They didn’t 
like me. Perhaps I talked too 
much. Perhaps I gave them too 
much advice. Perhaps I remind- 
ed them of their mother, who was 
dead. I don’t know. I won’t ever 
know. They didn’t want to see 
me. Out of manners, they sent 
me cards on my birthday. Out of 
sheer formal courtesy, they 
called on me sometimes. Now 
and then one of them wanted 
something. Then they came to 
me, but it was always just to get 
something. It took me a long time 
to figure out, but I hadn’t done 
anything. It wasn’t what I had 
done or hadn’t done. They just 
plain didn’t like me. You know 
the songs and the operas and the 
stories. Folly, you know them 
all.” 

“Not all of them,” thought Fol- 
ly gently, “not all of them. Just 
a few thousand.” 

“Did you ever see one,” cried 
Samm, his thoughts ringing 
fiercely against her mind, “did 
you ever see a single one about a 
rejected father? They’re all 
about men and women, love and 
sex, but I can tell you that re- 
jection hurts even when you don’t 
ask anything of your loved ones 
but their company and their hap- 
piness and their simple genuine 
smiles. When I knew that my 
children had no use for me, I had 
no use for me either. The Instru- 
110 



mentality came along with this 
warning, and I volunteered.” 

“But you’re all right now, 
Samm,” said Folly gently. “I’m a 
ship and you are a metal giant 
but we’re off doing work which 
is important for all mankind. 
We’ll have adventures together. 
Even black and grumbly here,” 
she added, meaning Finsternis, 
“can’t keep us from the excite- 
ment of companionship or the 
hope of danger. We’re doing 
something wonderful and impor- 
tant and exciting. Do you know 
what I would do if I had my life 
again, my ordinary life with skin 
and toenails and hair and things 
like that?” 

“What?” asked Samm, know- 
ing the answer perfectly well 
from the hundreds of times they 
had touched on this point. 

“I’d take baths. Hundreds and 
hundreds of them, over again. 
Showers and dips in cold pools 
and soaks in hot bathtubs and 
rinses and more showers. And I 
would do my hair, over and over 
again, thousands of different 
ways. And I would put on lip- 
stick, in the most outrageous col- 
ors, even if nobody saw me, ex- 
cept for my own self looking in 
the mirror. Now I can hardly re- 
member what it used to be to be 
dry or wet. I’m in this ship and 
I see the ship and I do not really 
know if I am a person or not any 
more.” 



GALAXY 



Samm stayed quiet, knowing 
what she would say next. 

“Samm, what would you do?” 
Folly asked. 

“Swim,” he said. 

“Then swim, Samm, swim! 
Swim for me in the space be- 
tween the stars. You still have a 
body and I don’t, but I can 
watch you and I can sense you 
swimming out here in the noth- 
ing-at-all.” 

Samm began to swim a huge 
Australian crawl, dipping his face 
to the edge of the water — as if 
there were water there. The ges- 
tures made no difference in his 
real motion, since they were all of 
them in the fast trajectory com- 
puted for them from the point 
where they left the Instrumen- 
tality’s ship and started out in 
normal space for the star listed 
as Linschoten XV. 

This time, something very 
sudden happened, and, it hap- 
pened strangely. 

From the dark gloomy silence 
of the cube Finsternis, there 
came an articulate cry, called 
forth in clear human speech; 

Stop it! Stop moving right 
now. 1 attack. 

Both Samm and Folly had in- 
struments built into them, so 
they could read space around 
them. The instruments, quickly 
scanned, showed nothing. Yet 
Folly felt odd, as though some- 
thing had gone very wrong in her 
THREE TO A GIVEN STAR 



ship-self, which had seemed so 
metal, so reliable, so inalterable. 

She threw a thought of inquiry 
at Samm and instead got another 
command from Finsternis, Don’t 
think. 

Ill 

S amm floated like a dead man 
in his gargantuan body. 
Folly drifted like a fruit beside 
his hand. 

At last there came words from 
Finsternis : 

“You can think now, if you 
want to. You can chatter at each 
other again. I’m through.” 

Samm thought at him, and the 
thought-pattern was troubled 
and confused: “What happened? 
I felt as though the immaculate 
grid of space had been pinched 
together in a tight fold. I felt you 
do something, and then there was 
silence around us again.” 

“Talking,” said Finsternis, “is 
not operational and it is not re- 
quired of me. But there are only 
three of us here, so I might as 
well tell you what happened. 
Can you hear me. Folly?” 

“Yes,” she said, weakly. 

“Are we on course,” asked Fin- 
sternis, “for the third planet of 
Linschoten XV?” 

F oily paused while checking all 
her instruments, which were more 
compheated and refined than 
those carried by the other two, 

111 



since she was the maintenance 
unit. “Yes,” said she at last. “We 
are exactly on course. I don’t 
know what happened, if anything 
did happen.” 

“Something happened, all 
right,” said Finsternis, with the 
gratified savagery of a person 
whose quick-and-cruel nature is 
rewarded only by meeting and 
overcoming hostility in real life. 

“Was it a space dragon, like 
they used to meet on the old, old 
ships?” 

“No, nothing like that,” said 
Finsternis, communicative for 
once, since this was something 
operational to talk about. “It 
doesn’t even seem to be in this 
space at all. Something just rises 
up among us, like a volcano com- 
ing out of solid space. Something 
violent and wild and alive. Do 
you two still have eyes?” 

“Seeing devices for the ordi- 
nary light band?” asked Samm. 

“Of course we do!” said Fin- 
stemis. “I will try to fix it so that 
you will have a visible input.” 

There was a sharp pause from 
Finsternis. 

The voice came again, with 
much strain. 

“Do not do anything. Do not 
try to help me. Just watch. If it 
wins, destroy me and destroy 
yourselves very quickly. It might 
try to capture us and get back 
to Earth.” 

Folly felt like telling Finsternis 

112 



that this was unnecessary, since 
the first motion toward return 
would trigger destruction devices 
which had been built into each 
of the three of them, beyond 
reach, beyond detection, beyond 
awareness. When the Instrumen- 
tality said, “Do not come back,” 
the Instrumentality meant it. 

She said nothing. 

She watched Finsternis instead. 

Something began to happen. 

It was very odd. 

Space itself seemed to rip and 
leak. 

In the visible band, the intrud- 
er looked like a fountain of water 
being thrown randomly to and 
fro. 

But the intruder was not water. 

In the visible light-band, it 
glowed like wild fire rising from 
a shimmering column of blue ice. 
Here in space there was nothing 
to burn, nothing to make light: 
she knew that Finsternis was 
translating unresolvable phen- 
omena into light. 

She sensed Samm moving one 
of his giant fists uncontrollably, 
in a helpless, childish gesture of 
protest. 

She herself did nothing but 
watch, as alertly and passively 
as she could. 

Nevertheless, she felt wren- 
ched. This was no material phe- 
nomenon. It was wild unformed 
life, intruding out of some other 
proportion of space, seeking ma- 

GALAXY 



terial on which to impose its 
vitality, its frenzy, its identity. 
She could see Finsternis as a 
solid black cube, darker than 
mere darkness, drifting right in- 
to the column. She watched the 
sides of Finsternis. 

On the earlier part of the trip, 
since they had left the people 
and the planoform ship and had 
been discharged in a fast tra- 
jectory toward Linschoten XV, 
Finsternis’ sides had seemed like 
dull metal, slightly burnished, 
so that Folly had to brush him 
lightly vdth radar to get a clear 
image of him. 

Now his sides had changed. 

They had become as soft and 
thick as velvet. 

The strange volcano-fountain 
did not seem to have much in the 
way of sensing devices. It paid no 
attention to Samm or to herself. 
The dark cube attracted it, as 
a shaft of sunlight might attract 
a baby or as the rustle of paper 
might draw the attention of a 
kitten. 

With a slight tvdst of its vital- 
ity and direction, the whole 
column of burning, living bright- 
ness plunged upon Finsternis, 
plunged and burned out and went 
in and was seen no more. 

F insternis’ voice, clear and 
cheerful, sounded out to 
both of them: 

“It’s gone now.” 

THREE TO A GIVEN STAR 



“What happened to it?” asked 
Samm. 

“I ate it,” said Finsternis. 

“You what?” cried Folly. 

“I ate it,” said Finsternis. He 
was talking more than he ever 
had before. “At least, that’s the 
only way I can describe it. This 
machine they gave me or made 
me into or whatever they did, 
it’s really rather good. It’s power- 
ful. I can feel it absorbing things, 
taking them in, taking them 
apart, putting them away. It’s 
something like eating used to be 
when I was a person. That wild 
thing attacked me, wrapped me 
up, devoured me. All I did was 
to take it in, and now it’s gone. 
I feel sort of full. I suppose my 
machines are sorting our samples 
of it to send away to rendezvous 
points in little rockets. I know 
that I have sixteen small rockets 
inside me, and I can feel two of 
them getting ready to move. Nei- 
ther one of you could have done 
what I do. I was built to a’osorb 
whole suns if necessary, break 
them down, freeze them down, 
change their molecular structure 
and shoot their vitality off in one 
big useless blast on the radio 
spectrum. You couldn’t do any- 
thing like that, Samm, even if 
ycu do have arms and legs and 
a head and a voice — if we ever 
get into an atmosphere for you 
to use it in. You couldn’t do 
what I have just done. Folly.” 

113 



“You’re ^ood,” said Folly, with 
emphasis. But she added: “I can 
repair you.” 

Obviously offended, Finsternis 
withdrew into his silence. 

Samm said to Folly, “How 
much further to destination?” 
Said Folly promptly, “Seven- 
ty-nine earth years, four months 
and three days, six hours and two 
minutes, but you know how little 
that means out here. It could 
seem like a single afternoon or it 
could feel to us like a thousand 
lifetimes. Time doesn’t work 
very well for us.” 

“How did Earth ever find this 
place, anyhow?” said Samm. 

“All I know is that it was two 
very strong telepaths, working to- 
gether on the planet Mizzer. An 
ex-dictator named Casher O’Neill 
and an ex-Lady named Celalta. 
They were doing a bit of psionic 
astronomy and suddenly this sig- 
nal came in strong and clear. You 
know that telepaths can catch di- 
rections very accurately. Even 
over immense distances. And 
they can get emotions, too. But 
they are not very good at actual 
images or things. Somebody else 
checked it out for them.” 

“M-m-m,” said Samm. He had 
heard all this before. Out of sheer 
boredom, he went back to swim- 
ming vigorously. The body might 
not really be his, but it made him 
feel good to exercise it. 

Besides, he knew that Folly 
114 



watched him with pleasure — 
great pleasure, and a little bit of 
envy. 

Rasher O’Neill and the Lady 
Celalta had finished with 
making love. 

They had lain with their bodies 
tired and their minds clear, re- 
laxed. They had stretched out 
on a blanket just above the big 
gushing spring which was the 
source of the Ninth Nile. Both 
telepaths, they could hear a bird- 
couple quarreling inside a tree, 
the male bird commanding the 
female to get out and get to 
work and the female answering 
by dropping deeper and deeper 
into a fretful and irritable sleep. 

The Lady Celalta had whis- 
pered a thought to her lover and 
master, Casher O’Neill. 

“To the stars?” 

“The stars?” thought he with 
a grumble. They were both strong 
telepaths. He had been imprinted, 
in some mysterious way, with 
the greatest telepath-hypnotist of 
all time, the Honorable Agatha 
Madigan, who had gone down in 
history as the Hechizera of Gort- 
falon, the only person in history 
to hypnotize the men and robots 
of a battle fleet so that it des- 
troyed itself in open space. Cash- 
er O’Neill had also retained dim 
memories of a half-grown girl, in- 
credibly lovely in a simple blue 
dress, lost to him somewhere be- 

GALAXY 



yond amnesiac stars, but in the 
Lady Celalta he had a compan- 
ion worthy of his final talents, a 
natural telepath who could her- 
self reach not only all of Miz- 
zer but some of the nearer stars. 
When they teamed up together, 
as she now proposed, they could 
plunge into dusty infinities of 
depth and bring back feelings or 
images which no Go-Captain had 
ever found with his ship. 

He sat up with a grunt of as- 
sent. 

She looked at him fondly, pos- 
sessively, her dark eyes alight 
with alertness, happiness, pos- 
sessiveness and adventure. 

“Can I lift?” she asked, almost 
timidly. 

When two telepaths worked to- 
gether, one cleared the vision for 
both of them as far as their com- 
binded minds could reach and 
then the other sprang, with enor- 
mous effort as far and as fast as 
possible toward any target which 
presented itself. They had found 
strange things, sometimes beauti- 
ful or dramatic ones, by this 
method. 

Casher was already drinking 
enormous gulps of air, filling his 
lungs, holding his breath, letting 
go with a gasp, and then inhaling 
deeply and slowly again. In this 
way he reoxygenated his brain 
very thoroughly for the huge ef- 
fort of a telepathic dive into the 
remote depth of space. He did 
THREE TO A GIVEN STAR 



not even speak to her, nor did he 
telepath a word to her; he ivas 
conserving his strength for a good 
jump. 

He merely nodded to her. 

The Lady Celalta, too, began 
the deep breathing, but she seem- 
ed to need it less than did Cash- 
er. 

They were both sitting up, side 
by side, breathing deeply. 

The cool night sands of Mizzer 
were around them, the harmless 
gurgle of the Ninth Nile beside 
them, the bright star-cluttered 
sky of Mizzer was above them. 

Her hand reached out and took 
hold of his. 

She squeezed his hand. He 
looked at her and nodded to her 
again. 

Within his mind, Mizzer and 
its entire solar system seemed 
to burst into flame with a new 
kind of light. The radiance of 
Celalta’ s mind trailed off uneven- 
ly in different directions but 
there, almost 2° off the pole of 
Mizzer’s ecliptic, he felt some- 
thing wild and strange, a kind 
of being which he had never 
sensed before. Using Celalta’s 
mind as a base, he let his mind 
dive for it. 

The distance'of the plunge left 
them both dizzy, sitting on the 
quiet night sands of Mizzer. It 
seemed to both of them that the 
mind of man had never reached 
so far before. 



115 



IV 



The reality of the phenomenon 
was undoubtable. 

There were animals all around 
them, the usual categories: run- 
ners, hunters, jumpers, climbers, 
swimmers, hiders and handlers. 
It was some of the handlers who 
were intensely telepathic them- 
selves. 

The image of man creat- 
ed an immediate, murderous re- 
sponse : 

“Cackle gabble, gabble cack- 
le, man, man, man, eat them, eat 
them!” 

Casher and Celalta were both 
so surprised that they let the con- 
tact go, after making sure that 
they had touched a whole world 
full of beings, some of them tele- 
pathic and probably civilized. 

How had the beings known 
“man”? Why had their response 
been immediate? Why anthropo- 
phagous and homicidal? 

They took time, before com- 
ing completely out of the trance, 
to make a careful, exact note of 
the direction from which the 
danger-brains had shrieked their 
weaning. 

This they submitted to the In- 
strumentality, shortly after the 
incident. 

And that was how, unknown 
to Folly, Samm and Finsternis, 
the inhabitants on the third 
planet of Linschoten XV had 
come to the attention of man- 
kind. 

116 



Asa matter of fact, the three 
wanderers later on felt a 
vague, remote telepathic contact 
which they sensed as being warm- 
hearted and human, and there- 
fore did not try to track down, 
with their minds or their wea- 
pons. It was O’Neill and Celalta, 
many years later by Mizzer time, 
reaching to see what the Instru- 
mentality had done about Lins- 
choten XV. 

Folly, Samm and Finsternis 
had no suspicion that the two 
most powerful telepaths in the 
human area of the galaxy had 
stroked them, searched them, felt 
them through, and seen things 
about them which the three of 
them did not know about them- 
selves or about each other. 

Casher O’Neill said to the 
Lady Celalta: 

“You got it, too?” 

“A beautiful woman, encased 
in a little ship?” 

Casher nodded: “A red-head 
with skin as soft and transparent 
as living ivory? A woman who 
was beautiful and will be beauti- 
ful again?” 

“That’s what I got,” said the 
Lady Celalta. “And the tired old 
man, weary of his children and 
weary of his own life because his 
children were weary of him.” 
“Not so old,” said Casher 
O’Neill. “And isn’t that a spec- 

GALAXY 




tacular piece of machinery they 
put him into? A metal giant. It 
felt like something about a quar- 
ter of a kilometer high. Acid- 
proof. Cold-proof. Won’t he be 
surprised when he finds that the 
Instrumentality has rejuvenated 
his own body inside that mon- 
ster?” 

“He certainly will be,” said the 
Lady Celalta happily, thinking 
of the pleasant surprise which 
lay ahead of a man whom she 
would never know or see with 
her own bodily eyes. 

They both fell silent. 

Then said the Lady Celalta, 
“But the third person . .” There 
was a shiver in her voice as 
though she dared not ask the 
THREE TO A GIVEN STAR 



question. “The third person, the 
one in the cube.” She stopped, 
as though she could neither ask 
nor say more. 

“It was not a robot or a person- 
ality cube,” said Casher O’Neill. 
“It was a human being all right. 
But it’s crazy. Could you make 
out, Celalta, as to whether it was 
male or female?” 

“No,” said she, “I couldn’t tell. 
The other two seemed to think 
that it was male.” 

“But did you feel sure?” asked 
Casher. 

“With that being, I felt sure of 
nothing. It was human, all right, 
but it was stranger than any lost 
hominid we have ever felt around 
the forgotten stars. Could you 

117 



tel!, Casher, whether it was 
young or old?” 

“No,” said he. “I felt nothing 
— only a desperate human mind 
with all its guards up, living only 
because of the terrible powers of 
the black cube, the sun-killer in 
which it rode. I never sensed 
someone before who was a person 
without characteristics. It’s fright- 
ening.” 

“The Instrumentality are cruel 
sometimes,” said Celalta. 

“Sometimes they have to be,” 
Casher agreed. 

“But I never thought that they 
would do that.” 

“Do what?” asked Casher. 

Her dark eyes looked at him. 
It was a different night, and a 
different Nile, but the eyes were 
only a very little bit older and 
they loved him just as much as 
ever. The Lady Celalta trembled 
as though she herself might think 
that the all-powerful Instrumen- 
tality could have hidden a micro- 
phone in the random sands. She 
whispered to her lover, her mas- 
ter: 

“You said it yourself, Casher, 
just a moment ago.” 

“Said what?” He spoke tender- 
ly but fearlessly, his voice ring- 
ing out over the cool night sands. 

'T'he Lady Celalta went on 
whispering, which was very 
unlike her usual self: “You said 
that the third person was ‘crazy.’ 
118 



Do you realize that you may 
have spoken the actual literal 
truth?” Her whisper darted at 
him like a snake. 

At last, he whispered back : 
“What did you sense? What could 
you guess?” 

“They have sent a madman to 
the stars. Or a mad woman. A 
real psychotic.” 

“Lots of pilots,” said Casher, 
speaking more normally, “are 
cushioned against loneliness with 
real but artificially activated psy- 
choses. It gets them through me 
real or imagined horrors of the 
sufferings of space.” 

“I don’t mean that,” said Celal- 
ta, still whispering urgently and 
secretly. “I mean a real psy- 
chotic.” 

“But there aren’t any. Not 
loose, that is,” said Casher, 
stammering with surprise at last. 
“They either get cured or they 
are bottled up in thought-proof 
satellites somewhere.” 

Celalta raised her voice a little, 
just a little, so that she no longer 
whispered but spoke urgently. 

“But don’t you see, that’s what 
they must have done. The In- 
strumentality made a star-killer 
too strong for any normal mind 
to guide. So the Lords got a 
psychotic somewhere, a real psy- 
chotic, and sent a madman out 
among the stars. Otherwise we 
could have felt its gender or its 
age.” 



GALAXY 



Casher nodded in silent agree- 
ment. The air did not feel colder, 
but he got gooseflesh sitting be- 
side his beloved Celalta on the 
familiar desert sands. 

“You’re right. You must be 
right. It almost makes me feel 
sorry for the enemies out near 
Linschoten Fifteen. Do you see 
nothing of them this time? I 
couldn’t perceive them at all.’’ 

“I did, a little,” said the Lady 
Celalta. “Their telepaths have 
caught the strange minds coming 
at them with a high rate of speed. 
The telepathic ones are wild with 
excitement but the others are 
just going cackle-gabble, cackle- 
gabble with each other, filled with 
anger, hunger and the thought 
of man.” 

“You got that much?” he said 
in wonder. 

“My lord and my lover, I dived 
this time. Is it so strange that I 
sensed more than you did? Your 
strength lifted me.” 

“Did you hear what the wea- 
pons called each other?” 

“Something silly.” He could 
see her knitting her brows in the 
bright starshine which illuminat- 
ed the desert almost the way that 
the Old Original Moon lit up the 
nights sometimes on Manhome 
Itself. “It was Folly, and some- 
thing like ‘Superordinated Alien 
Measuring and Mastery machine’ 
and something like ‘darkness’ in 
the Ancient Doyches Language.” 
THREE TO A GIVEN STAR 



“That’s what I got, too,” said 
Casher. “It sounds like a weird 
team.” 

“But a powerful one, a terribly 
powerful one,” said the Lady 
Celalta. “You and I, my lover 
and master, have seen strange 
things and dangers between 
the stars, even before we met 
each other, but we never saw any- 
thing like this before, did we?” 
“No,” said he. 

“Well, then,” said she, “let us 
sleep and forget the matter as 
much as we can. The Instrumen- 
tality is certainly taking care of 
Linschoten Fifteen, and we two 
not need botlier about it.” 

And all that Samm, Folly and 
Finsternis knew was that a light 
touch, unexplained but friendly, 
had gone over them from the far 
star region near home. Thought 
they, if they thought anything 
about it at all, “The Instrumen- 
tality, which made us and sent 
us, has checked up on us one 
more time.” 

V 

few years later, Samm and 
Folly were talking again 
while Finsternis — guarded, 
impenetrable, uncommunicating, 
detectable only by the fierce glow 
of human life which shone tele- 
pathically out of the immense 
cube — rode space beside them 
and said nothing. 



119 



Suddenly Folly cried out to 
Samm loudly: 

“I can smell them.” 

“Smell who?” asked Samm 
mildly. “There isn’t any smell out 
here in the nothingness of 
space.” 

“Silly,” thought Folly back, 
“I don’t mean really smell. I 
mean that I can pick up their 
sense of odor telepathically.” 
“Whose?” said Samm, being 
dense. 

“Our enemies’, of course,” 
cried Folly. “The man-remem- 
berers who are not man. The 
cackle-gabble creatures. The be- 
ings who remember man and 
hate him. They smell thick and 
warm and alive to each other. 
Their whole world is full of 
smells. Their telepaths are get- 
ting frantic now. They have even 
figured out that there are three 
of us and they are trying to get 
our smells.” 

“And we have no smell. Not 
when we do not even know 
whether we have human bodies 
or not, inside these things. Im- 
agine this metal body of mine 
smelling. If it did have a smell,” 
said Samm, “it would probably 
be the very soft smell of work- 
ing steel and a little bit of lubri- 
cants, plus whatever odors my 
jets might activate inside an at- 
mosphere. If I know the Instru- 
mentality, they have made my 
jets smell awful to almost any 
120 



kind of being. Most forms of life 
think first through their noses 
and then figure out the rest of ex- 
perience later. After all, I was 
built to intimidate, to frighten, 
to destroy. The Instrumentality 
did not make this giant to be 
friendly with anybody. You and I 
can be friends. Folly, because you 
are a little ship which I could 
hold like a cigar between my 
fingers, and because the ship 
holds the memory of a very love- 
ly woman. I can sense what you 
once were. What you may still 
be, if your actual body is still in- 
side that boat.” 

“Oh, Samm!” she cried. “Do 
you think 1 might still be alive, 
really alive, with a real me in a 
real me, and a chance to be my- 
self somewhere again, out here 
between the stars?” 

“I can’t sense it plainly,” said 
Samm. “I’ve reached as much as 
I can through your ship with my 
sensors, but I can’t tell whether 
there’s a whole woman there or 
not. It might be just a memory of 
you dissected and laminated be- 
tween a lot of plastic sheets. 
I really can’t tell, but some- 
times I have the strangest hunch 
that you are still alive, in the old 
ordinary way, and that I am alive 
too.” 

“Wouldn’t that be wonderful!” 
She almost shouted at him. 
“Samm, imagine being us again, 
if we fulfill our mission and con- 

GALAXY 



quer this planet and stay alive 
and settle there! I might even 
meet you and — ” 

They both fell silent at the im- 
plications of being ordinary-alive 
again. They knew that they loved 
each other. Out here, in the im- 
mense blackness of space, there 
was nothing they could do but 
streak along in their fast trajec- 
tories and talk to each other a 
little bit by telepathy. 

“Samm,” said Folly, and the 
tone of her thought showed that 
she was changing a difficult sub- 
ject. “Do you think that we are 
the furthest out that people have 
ever gone? You used to be a 
technician. You might know. Do 
you?” 

“Of course I know,” thought 
Samm promptly. “We’re not. 
After all, we’re still deep inside 
our own galaxy.” 

“I didn’t know,” said Folly 
contritely. 

“With all those instruments, 
don’t you know where you are?” 

“Of course I know where I am, 
Samm. In relation to the third 
planet of Linschoten XV. I even 
have a faint idea of the general 
direction in which Old Earth 
must lie, and how many thou- 
sands of ages it would take us 
to get home, travelling through 
ordinary space, if we did try to 
turn around.” She thought to 
herself but didn’t add in her 
thought to Samm, “Which we 
THREE TO A GIVEN STAR 



can’t.” She thought again to him, 
“But I’ve never studied astrono- 
my or navigation, so I couldn’t 
tell whether we were at the edge 
of the galaxy or not.” 

“Nowhere near the edge,” said 
Samm. “We’re not John Joy 
Tree and we’re nowhere near the 
two-headed elephants which weep 
forever in intergalactic space.” 

C( T°hn Joy Tree?” sang Folly; 

av there was joy and memory 
in her thoughts as she sounded 
the name. “He was my idol when 
I was a girl. My father was a 
subchief of the Instrumentality 
and always promised to bring 
John Joy Tree to our house. We 
had a country and it was unusual 
and very fine for this day and 
age. But mister and Go-Captain 
Tree never got around to visiting 
us, so there I was, a big girl 
with picture-cubes of him all 
over my room. I liked him be- 
cause he was so much older than 
me, and so resolute-looking and 
so tender too. I had all sorts of 
romantic day-dreams about him, 
but he never showed up and I 
married the wrong man several 
times, and my children got given 
to the wrong people, so here I am. 
But what’s this stuff about two- 
headed elephants?” 

“Really?” said Samm. “I don’t 
see how you could hear about 
John Joy Tree and not know 
what he did.” 



121 



“I knew he flew far, far out, 
but I didn’t know exactly what 
he did. After all, I was just a 
child when I fell in love with his 
picture. What did he do? He’s 
dead now, I suppose, so I don’t 
suppose it matters.” 

Finsternis cut in, grimly and 
unexpectedly: “John Joy Tree 
is not dead. He’s creeping around 
a monstrous place on an aban- 
doned planet, and he is immortal 
and insane.” 

“How did you know that?” 
cried Samm, turning his enor- 
mous metal head to look at the 
dark burnished cube which had 
said nothing for so many years. 

There was no further thought 
from Finsternis, not a ghost, not 
an echo of a word. 

Folly prodded him: 

“It’s no use trying to make 
that thing talk if it doesn’t want 
to. We’ve both tried, thousands 
of times. Tell me about the two- 
headed elephants. Those are the 
big animals with large floppy ears 
and the noses that pick things 
up, aren’t they? And they make 
very wise, dependable under- 
people out of them?” 

“I don’t know about the under- 
people part, but the animals are 
the kind you mention, very big 
indeed. When John Joy Tree got 
far outside our cosmos by flying 
through space he found an enor- 
mous procession of open ships 
flying in columns where there 
122 



was nothing at all. The ships 
were made by nothing which man 
has ever even seen. We still don’t 
know where they came from or 
what made them. Each open ship 
had a sort of animal, something 
like an elephant with four front 
legs and a head at each end, and 
as he passed the unimaginable 
ships, these animals howled at 
him. Howled grief and mourning. 
Our best guess was that the 
ships were the tombs of some 
great race of beings and the howl- 
ing elephants the immortal half- 
living mourners who guarded 
them.” 

“But how did John Joy Tree 
ever get back?” 

“Ah, that was beautiful. If you 
go into spaces, you take noth- 
ing more than your own body with 
you. That was the finest engineer- 
ing the human race has ever done. 
They designed and built a whole 
planoform ship out of John Joy 
Tree’s skin, fingernails and hair. 
They had to change his body 
chemistry a bit to get enough 
metal in him to carry the coils 
and the electric circuits, but it 
worked. He came back. That was 
a man who could skip through 
space like a little boy hopping on 
familiar rocks. He’s the only pilot 
who ever piloted himself back 
home from outside our galaxy. I 
don’t know whether it will be 
worth the time and treasure to 
use spaces for intergalactic trips. 

GALAXY 



After all, some very gifted people 
may have already fallen through 
by accident, Folly. You and Fin- 
sternis and I are people who 
have been built into machines. 
We are now ourselves the ma- 
chines. But with Tree they did 
it the other way around. They 
made a machine out of him. And 
it worked. In that one deep flight 
he went billions of times further 
than we will ever go.” 

“You think you know,” said 
Finsternis unexpectedly. “You 
think you know. That’s what you 
always do. You think you know.” 
Folly and Samm tried to get 
Finsternis to talk some more, but 
nothing happened. After a few 
more rests and talks they were 
ready for landing on the third 
planet of Linschoten XV. 

''X^hey landed. 

They fought. 

Blood ran on the ground. Fire 
scorched the valleys and boiled 
the lakes. The telepathic world 
was full of the cackle-gabble of 
fright, hatred throwing itself in- 
to suicide, fury turning into sur- 
render, into deep despair, into 
hopelessless, and at last into a 
strange kind of quiet and love. 
Let us. not tell that story. 

It can be written some other 
time, told by some other voice. 

The beings died by thousands 
and tens of thousands while Fin- 
sternis sat on a mountain-top, 
THREE TO A GIVEN STAR 



doing nothing. Folly wove death 
and destruction, uncoded langu- 
ages, drew maps, showed Samm 
the strong-points and the wea- 
pons which had to be destroyed. 
Part of the technology was very 
advanced, other parts were still 
tribal. The dominant race was 
that of the beings who had evolv- 
ed into handlers and thinkers; 
it was they who were the tele- 
paths. 

All hatred ceased as the haters 
died. 

Only the submissive ones lived 
on. 

Samm tore cities about with 
his bare metal hands, ripped 
heavy guns to pieces while they 
were firing at him, picking the 
gunners off the gun carriages as 
though they were lice, swimming 
oceans when he had to, with 
Folly darting and hovering 
around or ahead of him. 

Final surrender was brought 
by their strongest telepath, a very 
wise old male who had been 
hidden inside a deep mountain; 

“You have come, people. We 
surrender. Some of us have al- 
ways known the truth. We are 
Earth-born, too. A cargo of chick- 
ens settled here unimaginable 
times ago. A time-twist tore us 
out of our convoy and threw us 
here. That’s way, v/hen we sensed 
you far across space, we caught 
the relationship of eat-and-eaten. 
Only, our brave ones had it 

123 




wrong. You eat us: we don’t eat 
you. You are the masters now. 
We will serve you forever. Do 
you seek our death?” 

“No, no,” said Folly. “We 
came only to avert a danger, and 
we have done that. Live on, and 
on, but plan no war and make 
no weapons. Leave that to the 
Instrumentality.” 

“Blessed is the Instrumentality, 
whoever that may be. We accept 
124 



your terms. We belong to you.” t, 

"^XThen this was done, the war 
was over. 

Strange things began to hap- 
pen. 

Wild voices sang from within 
Folly and Samm, voices not their 
own: 

Mission gone. Work finished. 

Go to hill with cube. Go and re- 
joice! 



GALAXY 



Samm and Folly hesitated. 
They had left Finsternis where 
they landed, halfway around the 
planet. 

The singing voices became 
more urgent: 

Go. Go. Go now. Go back to 
the cube. Tell the chicken-people 
to plant a lawn and a grove of 
trees. Go, go, go now to the 
good reward! 

They told the telepaths what 
had been said to them and voy- 
aged wearily up out of the atmo- 
sphere and back down for a 
landing at the original point of 
contact, a long low hill which 
had been planted with huge 
patches of green turf and freshly 
transplanted trees even in the 
hours in which they flew off the 
world and back on it again. The 
bird-telepaths must have had 
strong and quick commands. 

The singing became pure music 
as they landed, chorales of re- 
ward and rejoicing, with the hint 
of martial marches and victory 
fugues woven in. 

Alan, stand up, said the voices 
to Samm. 

Samm stood on the ridge of 
the hill. He stood like a colos- 
sus against the red-dawning sky. 
A friendly, quiet crowd of the 
chicken-people fell back. 

Alan, put your hand to your 
right forehead, sang the voices. 

Samm obeyed. He did not 
know why the voices called him 
THREE TO A GIVEN STAR 



“Alan.” 

Ellen, land, sang the rejoic- 
ing voices to Folly. Folly, herself 
a little ship, landed at Samm’s 
feet. She was bewildered with 
happy confusion and a great deal 
of pain which did not seem to 
matter much. 

Alan, come forth, sang the 
voices. Samm felt a sharp pain 
as his forehead — his huge metal 
forehead, two hundred meters 
above the ground — burst open 
and closed again. There was 
something pink and helpless in 
his hand. 

The voices commanded, Alan, 
put your hand gently on the 
ground. 

Samm obeyed and put his hand 
on the ground. The little pink toy 
fell on the fresh turf. It was a 
tiny miniature of a man. 

Ellen, stand forth, sang the 
voices again. The ship named 
Folly opened a door and a naked 
young woman fell out. 

Alma, wake up. The cube 
named Finsternis turned darker 
than charcoal. Out of the dark 
side, there stumbled a black- 
haired girl. She ran across the 
hill-slope to the figure named 
Ellen. The man-body named 
Alan was struggling to his feet. 

The three of them stood up. 

The voices spoke to them: 
“This is our last message. You 
have done your work. You are 
well. The boat named Folly con- 

125 



VI 



tains tools, medicine and the oth- 
er equipment for a human colony. 
The giant named Samm will 
stand forever as a monument to 
human victory. The cube named 
Finsternis will now dissolve. 
Alan! Ellen! Treat Alma loving- 
ly and well. She is now a for- 
getty.” 

The three naked people stood 
bewildered in the dawn. 

“Good-by and a great high 
thanks from the Instrumentality. 
This is a pre-coded message, ef- 
fective only if you won. You 
have won. Be happy. Live on!” 

Ellen took Alma — who had 
been Finsternis — and held her 
tight. The great cube dissolved 
into a shapeless slag-heap. Alan, 
who had been Samm, looked up 
at his former body dominating 
the skyline. 

For reasons which the travelers 
did not understand until many 
years had passed, the bird-peo- 
ple around them broke into ulu- 
lant hymns of peace, welcome 
and joy. 

“My house,” said Ellen, point- 
ing at the little ship which had 
spat forth her body just minutes 
ago, “is now a home for all of 
us.” 

They climbed into the success- 
ful little ship which had been 
called Folly. They knew, some- 
how, that they would find clothes 
and food. And wisdom, too. They 
did. 

126 



''T^en years later, they had the 
proof of happiness playing 
in the yard before their house — 
a substantial building, made of 
stone and brick, which the local 
people had built under Alan’s di- 
rections. (They had changed their 
whole technology in the process 
of learning from him, and — 
thanks to the efficiency and 
power of the telepathic priestly 
caste — things learned at any 
one spot on the planet were swift- 
ly disseminated to the whole 
group of races on the planet.) 
The proof of happiness consisted 
of the thirty-five human children 
playing in the yard. Ellen had 
had nine, four sets of twins and 
a single. Alma had had twelve, 
two sets of quintuplets and a 
pair of twins. The other fourteen 
had been bottle-grown from ova 
and sperm which they found in 
the ship, the frozen donations of 
complete strangers who had done 
their bit for the offworld settling 
of the human race. Thanks to the 
careful genetic coding of both the 
womb-children and the bottle- 
children, there was a variety of 
types, suitable for natural breed- 
ing over many generations to 
come. 

Alan same to the door. He 
measured the time by the place 
where the great shadow fell. It 
was hard to realize that the gigan- 

GALAXY 



tic, indestructible statue which 
loomed above them all had once 
been his own self. A small glacier 
was beginning to form around 
the feet of Samm and the night 
was getting cold. 

“I’m bringing the children in 
already,” said Ch-tikkik, one of 
the local nurses they had hired 
to help with the huge brood of 
human babies. She, in return, 
got the privilege of hatching her 
eggs on the warm shelf behind the 
electric stove; she turned them 
every hour, eagerly awaiting the 
time that sharp little mouths 
would break the shell and hrunan- 
like little hands would tear an 
opening from which a human- 
like baby would emerge, oddly- 
pretty-ugly like a gnome, and 
unusual only in that it could 
stand upright from the moment 
of birth. 

One little boy was arguing 
with Ch-tikkik. He wore a warm 
robe of vegetable-fiber veins 
knitted to serve as a base for a 
feather cloak. He was pointing 
out that with such a robe he 
could survive a blizzard and 
claiming, quite justly, that he 
did not have to be in the house 
in order to stay warm. Was that 
Rupert? thought Alan. 

He was about to call the child 
when his two wives came to the 
door, arm in arm, flushed with 
the heat of the kitchen where 
they had been cooking the two 
THREE TO A GIVEN STAR 



dinners together — one dinner 
for the human, now numbering 
thirty-seven, and the other for the 
bird-people, who were tremen- 
dously appreciative of getting 
cooked food, Irut v/ho had odd re- 
quirements in the recipes, such 
as “one quart of finely ground 
granite gravel to each gallon of 
oatmeal, sugared to taste and 
served with soybean milk.” 

Alan stood behind his wives 
and put a hand on the shoulder 
of each. 

“It’s hard to think,” he said, 
“that a little over ten years ago, 
we didn’t even know that we were 
still people. Now look at us, a 
family, and a good one.” 

Alma turned her face up to be 
kissed, and Ellen, who was less 
sentimental, lifted 'ner face to be 
kissed too, so that her co-wife 
would not be embarrassed at be- 
ing babied separately. The two 
liked each other very much. Al- 
ma came out of the cube Finis- 
ternis as a forgetty, conditioned 
to remember nothing of her long 
sad psychotic life before the In- 
strumentality had sent her on a 
wild mission among the stars. 
When she had joined Alan and 
Ellen, she knew the words of the 
Old Common Tongue, but very 
little else. 

Ellen had had some time 
to teach her, to love her and to 
mother her before any of the 
babies were born, and the re’T- 

127 



tionship between the two oi’ thein 
was warm and good. 

^'T^he three parents stood aside 
as the bird-women, wearing 
their comfortable and pretty 
feather cloaks, herded the chil- 
dren into the house. The smallest 
children had already been 
brought in from their sunning and 
were being given their bottles by 
bird-girls who never got tired of 
watching the cuteness and help- 
lessness of the human infant. 

“It’s hard to think of that time 
at all,” said Ellen, who had been 
“Folly.” “I wanted beauty and 
fame and a perfect marriage and 
nobody even told me that they 
just didn’t go together. I have 
had to come to the end of the 
stars to get what I wanted, to 
be what I might become.” 

“And me,” said Alma, who had 
been “Finsternis,” “I had a worse 
problem. I was crazy. I was 
afraid of life. I didn’t know how 
to be a person. I didn’t even 
know how to be a woman, a 
sweetheart, a female, a mother. 
How could I ever guess that I 
needed a sister and wife, like the 
one you have been, to make my 
life whole? Without you to show 
me, Ellen, I could never have 
married our husband. I thought I 
was carrying murder among the 
stars, but I was carrying my own 
solution as well. Where else 
could I turn out to be me?” 

128 



“And I,” said Alan, who had 
been “Samm,” “became a metal 
giant between the stars because 
my first wife was dead and my 
own children forgot me and neg- 
lected me. Nobody can say I’m 
not a father now. Thirty-five, and 
more than half of them mine. 
I’ll be more of a father than 
any other man of the human race 
has ever been.” 

There was a change in the sha- 
dow as the enormous right arm 
swung quietly but heavily to- 
ward the sky as a prelude to the 
sharp robotic call that nightfall, 
calculated with astronomical pre- 
cision, had indeed come to the 
place where he stood. 

The arm reached its height, 
pointing straight up. 

“I used to do that,” said Alan. 

The cry came, something like 
a silent pistol-shot which all of 
them heard, but a shot without 
echoes, without reverberations. 

Alan looked around. “All the 
children are in. Even Rupert. 
Come in, my darlings, and let us 
have dinner together.” Alma and 
EUen went ahead of him and he 
barred the heavy doors behind 
them. 

This was peace and happiness; 
that at last was goodness. They 
had no obligation but to live and 
to be happy. The threat and the 
promise of victory were far, far 
behind.

SMALL DEER 

by CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 



Something killed the dinosaurs. 
And where's that Something now? 



Willow Bend, Wisconsin 
June 23, 1966 
Dr. Wyman Jackson, 

Wyalusing College, 

Muscoda, Wisconsin 

My dear Dr. Jackson: 

I am writing to you because 
I don’t know who else to write 
to and there is something I have 
to tell someone who can under- 
stand. I know your name because 
I read your book, “Cretaceous 
Dinosaurs,” not once, but many 
times. I tried to get Dennis to 
read it, too, but I guess he never 
did. All Dennis ever was inter- 
ested in were the mathematics 
of his time concept — not the 
time machine itself. Besides, 



Dennis doesn’t read too well. It 
is a chore for him. 

Maybe I should tell you, to 
start with, that my name is Alton 
James. I live with my widowed 
mother and I run a fix-it shop. I 
fix bicycles and lawn mowers and 
radios and television sets — I fix 
anything that is brought in to me. 
I’m not much good at anything 
else, but I do seem to have the 
knack of seeing how things go 
together and understanding how 
they work and seeing what is 
wrong with them when they 
aren’t working. I never had no 
training of any sort, but I just 
seem to have a natural bent for 
getting along with mechanical 
contraptions. 

Dennis is my friend and I’ll 



129 



admit right off that he is a 
strange one. He doesn’t know 
from nothing about anything, but 
he’s nuts on mathematics. Peo- 
ple in town make fun of him be- 
cause he is so strange and Ma 
gives me hell at times for having 
anything to do with him. She 
says he’s the next best thing to 
a village idiot. I guess a lot of 
people think the way that Ma 
does, but it’s not ei^J:irely true, 
for he does know his math. 

I don’t know how he knows it. 

He didn’t learn it at school 
and that’s for sure. When he got 
to be 17 and hadn’t got no far- 
ther than eighth grade, the school 
just sort of dropped him. He 
didn’t really get to eighth grade 
honest; the teachers after a while 
got tired of seeing him on one 
grade and passed him to the next. 
There was talk, off and on, of 
sending him to some special 
school, but it never got nowhere. 

And don’t ask me what kind 
of mathematics he knew. I tried 
to read up on math once because 
I had the feeling, after seeing 
some of the funny marks that 
Dennis put on paper, that maybe 
he knew more about it than any- 
one else in the world. And I still 
think that he does — or that 
maybe he’s invented an entirely 
new kind of math. For in the 
books I looked through I never 
did find any of the symbols that 



Dennis put on paper. Maybe 
Dennis used symbols he made up, 
inventing them as he went along, 
because no one had ever told 
him what the regular mathemati- 
cians used. But I don’t think 
that’s it — I’m inclined to lean to 
the idea Dennis came up with a 
new brand of math, entirely. 

There were times I tried to 
talk with Dennis about this math 
of his and each time he was sur- 
prised that I didn’t know it, too. 
I guess he thought most people 
knew about it. He said that it 
was simple, that it was plain as 
day. It was the way things work- 
ed, he said. 

I suppose you’ll want to ask 
how come I understood his equa- 
tions well enough to make the 
time machine. The answer is I 
didn’t..! suppose that Dennis and 
I are alike in a lot of ways, but 
in different ways. I know how to 
make contraptions work (without 
knowing any of the theory) and 
Dennis sees the entire universe 
as something operating mathe- 
matically (and him scarcely able 
to read a page of simple type.) 

And another thing. My family 
and Dennis’ family live in the 
same end of town and from the 
time we were toddlers, Dennis 
and I played together. Later on, 
we just kept on together. We 
didn’t have a choice. For some 
reason or other, none of the kids 
would play with us. Unless we 



130 



GALAXY 



iwanted to play alone, we had to 
play together. I guess we got so, 
through the years, that we under- 
stood each other. 

I don’t suppose there’d been 
any time machine if I hadn’t 
been so interested in paleontol- 
ogy. Not that I knew anything 
about it; I was just interested. 
From the time I was a kid I 
read everything I could lay my 
hands on about dinosaurs and 
saber-tooths and such. Later on 
I went fossil hunting in the hills, 
but I never found nothing really 
big. Mostly I found brachiopods. 
There are great beds of them in 
the Platteville limestone. And 
lots of times I’d stand in the 
street and look up at the river 
bluffs above the town and try 
to imagine what it had been like 
a million years ago, or a hundred 
million. When I first read in a 
story about a time machine, I 
remember thinking how I’d like 
to have one. I guess that at one 
time I thought a little about 
making one, but then realized I 
couldn’t. 

'TAennis had a habit of coming 
to my shop and talking, but 
most of the time talking to him- 
self rather than to me. I don’t 
remember exactly how it started, 
but after a while I realized that 
he had stopped talking about 
anything but time. One day he 
told me he had been able to 



figure out everything but time, 
and now it seemed he was get- 
ting that down in black and 
white, like all the rest of it. 

IMostly I didn’t pay too much 
attention to what he said, for a 
lot of it didn’t make much sense. 
But after he’d talked, incessantly, 
for a week or two, on time, I be- 
gan to pay attention. But don’t 
expect me to tell you what he 
said or make any sense of it, 
for there’s no way that I can. 
To understand what Dennis said 
and meant, you’d have to live 
with him, like I did, for twenty 
years or more. It’s not so much 
understanding what Dennis says 
as understanding Dennis. 

I don’t think we actually made 
any real decision to build a time 
machine. It just sort of grew on 
us. All at once we found that we 
were making one. 

We took our time. We had to 
take our time, for we went back 
a lot and did things over, almost 
from the start. It took weeks to 
get some of the proper effects — 
at least, that’s what Dennis called 
them. Me, I didn’t know any- 
thing about effects. All that I 
knew was that Dennis wanted to 
make something work a certain 
way and I tried to make it work 
that way Sometimes, even when 
it worke'd the way he wanted it, 
it turned out to be wrong. So 
we’d start all over. 

But finally we had a working

model of it and took it out on a 
big bald bluff, several miles up 
the river, where no one ever 
went. I rigged up a timer to a 
switch that would turn it on, 
then after two minutes would re- 
verse the field and send it home 
again. 

We mounted a movie cam- 
era inside the frame that car- 
ried the machine, and we set the 
camera going, then threw the 
timer switch. 

I had my doubts that it would 
work, but it did. It went away 
and stayed for two minutes, then 
came back again. 

When we developed the cam- 
era film, we knew without any 
question the camera had traveled 
back in time. At first there were 
pictures of ourselves, standing 
there and waiting. Then there 
was a little blur, no more than 
a flicker, across a half a dozen 
frames, and the next frames 
showed a mastodon walking 
straight into the camera. A frac- 
tion of a second later his trunk 
jerked up and his ears flared out 
as he wheeled around with clum- 
sy haste and galloped down the 
ridge. 

Every now and then he’d 
swing his head around to take a 
look behind him. I imagine that 
our time machine, blossoming 
suddenly out of the ground in 
front of him, scared him out of 
seven years of growth. 



\\Ts were lucky, that was all. 

We could have sent that 
camera back another thousand 
times, perhaps, and never caught 
a mastodon — probably never 
caught a thing. Although we 
would have known it had moved 
in time, for the landscape had 
been different, although not a 
great deal different. But from the 
landscape we could not have told 
if it had gone back in time a hun- 
dred or a thousand years. When 
we saw the mastodon, however, 
we knew we’d sent the camera 
back 10,000 years at least. 

I won’t bore you with how we 
worked out a lot of problems 
on our second model, or how 
Dennis managed to work out a 
time-meter that we could cali- 
brate to send the machine a speci- 
fic distance into time. Because 
all this is not important. What 
is important is what I found 
when I went into time. 

I’ve already told you I’d read 
your book about Cretaceous di- 
nosaurs and I liked the entire 
book, but that final chapter about 
the extinction of the dinosaurs 
is the one that really got me. 
Many a time I’d lie awake at 
night thinking about all the the- 
ories you wrote about and trying 
to figure out in my own mind 
how it really was. 

So when it was time to get into 
that machine and go, 1 knew 
where I would be headed. 



132 



GALAXY 



Dennis gave me no argument. 
He didn’t even want to go. He 
didn’t care no more. He never 
was really interested in the time 
machine. All he wanted was to 
prove out his math. Once the 
machine did that, he was through 
with it. 

I worried a lot, going as far as 
I meant to go, about the rising 
or subsidence of the crust. I knew 
that the land around Willow 
Bend had been stable for millions 
of years. Sometime during the 
Cretaceous a sea had crept into 
the interior of the continent, but 
had stopped short of Wisconsin 
and, so far as geologists could de- 
termine, there had been no dis- 
turbances in the state. But I still 
felt uneasy about it. I didn’t want 
to come out into the Late Cre- 
taceous with the machine buried 
under a dozen feet of rock or, 
maybe, hanging a dozen feet up 
in the air. 

So I got some heavy steel pipes 
and sunk them six feet into the 
rock on the bald bluff top we 
had used that first time, with 
about ten feet of their length ex- 
tending in the air. I mounted the 
time frame on top of them and 
rigged up a ladder to get in and 
out of it and tied the pipes into 
the time field. 

One morning I packed a lunch 
and filled a canteen with water. 
I dug the old binoculars that had 
been my father’s out of the attic 



and debated whether I should 
take along a gun. All I had was 
a shotgun and I decided not to 
take it. If I’d had a rifle, there’d 
been no question of my taking 
it, but I didn’t have one. I could 
have borrowed one, but I didn’t 
want to. I’d kept pretty quiet 
about what I was doing and I 
didn’t want to start any gossip 
in the village. 

I went up to the bluff top and 
climbed up to the frame and 
set the time-meter for 63j4 mil- 
lion years into the past and then 
I turned her on. I didn’t make 
any ceremony out of it. I just 
turned her on and went. 

I told you about the little blur 
in the movie film and that’s the 
best way, I suppose, to tell you 
how it was. There was this little 
blur, like a flickering twilight. 
Then it was sunlight once again 
and I was on the bluff top, look- 
ing out across the valley. 

Except it wasn’t a bluff top 
any longer, but only a high hill. 
And the valley was not the rug- 
ged, tree-choked, deeply cut val- 
ley I had always known, but a 
great green plain, a wide and 
shallow valley with a wide and 
sluggish river flowing at the far 
side of it. Far to the west I 
could see a shimmer in the sun- 
light, a large lake or sea. But a 
sea, I thought, shouldn’t be this 
far east. But there it was, either 



SMALL DEER 



133 



a great lake or a sea — I never 
did determine which. 

And there was something else 
as Vv'ell. I looked down to the 
ground and it was only three feet 
under me. Was I ever glad I 
had used those pipes! 

Looking out across the valley, 
I could see some moving things, 
but they were so far away that 
I could not make them out. So 
I picked up the binoculars and 
jumped down to the ground and 
walked across the hilltop until 
the ground began to slope away. 

I sat down and put the binocu- 
lars to my eyes and worked 
across the valley with them. 

There were dinosaurs out there, 
a whole lot more of them than 
I had expected. They were in 
herds and they were traveling. 
You’d expect that out of any 
dozen herds of them, some of 
them would be feeding, but none 
of them was. All of them were 
moving and it seemed to me there 
was a nervousness in the way 
they moved. Although, I told 
myself, that might be the way 
it was with dinosaurs. 

They all were a long way off, 
even with the glasses, but I could 
make out some of them. There 
w'ere several groups of duckbills, 
waddling along and making 
funny jerky movements with 
their heads. I spotted a couple 
of small herds of thescelosaurs, 
pacing along, with their bodies 

134 



tilted forward. Here and there 
were small groups of triceratops. 
But strangest of all was a large 
herd of brontosaurs, ambling ner- 
vously and gingerly along, as if 
their feet might hurt. And it 
struck me strange, for they were 
a long ways from water and from 
what I’d read in your book, and 
in other books, it didn’t seem too 
likely they ever wandered too far 
away from water. 

And there were a lot of other 
things that didn’t look too much 
like the pictures I had seen in 
books. 

'"T^he whole business had a 
funny feel about it. Could 
it be, I wondered, that I had 
stumbled on some great migra- 
tion, with all the dinosaurs head- 
ing out for some place else? 

I got so interested in watching 
that I was downright careless and 
it was foolish of me. I was in 
another world and there could 
have been all sorts of dangers 
and I should have been watching 
out for them, but I was just sit- 
ting there, flat upon my back- 
side, as if I were at home. 

Suddenly there was a pound- 
ing, as if someone had turned 
loose a piledriver, coming up be- 
hind me and coming very fast. I 
dropped the glasses and twisted 
around and as I did something 
big and tall rushed past me, no 
more than three feet away, so 

GALAXY 



close it almost brushed me. I 
got just a brief impression of it 
as it went past — huge and gray 
and scaly. 

Then, as it went tearing down 
the hill, I saw what it was and 
I had a cold and sinking feeling 
clear down in my gizzard. For I 
had been almost run down by 
the big boy of them all — Tyran- 
nosaurus rex. 

His two great legs worked like 
driving pistons and the light of 
the sun glinted off the wicked, 
recurved claws as his feet pump- 
ed up and down. His tail rode 
low and awkward, but there was 
no awkwardness in the way he 
moved. His monstrous head 
swung from side to side, with 
the great rows of teeth showing 
in the gaping mouth, and he left 
behind him a faint foul smell — 
I suppose from the carrion he 
ate. But the big surprise was that 
the wattles hanging underneath 
his throat were a brilliant irri- 
descence — red and green and 
gold and purple, the color of 
them shifting as he swung his 
head. 

I watched him for just a sec- 
ond and then I jumped up and 
headed for the time machine. I 
was more scared than I like to 
think about. I had, I want to 
testify right here, seen enough 
of dinosaurs for a lifetime. 

But I never reached the time 
machine. 



Up over the brow of the hill 
came something else. I say some- 
thing else because I have no idea 
what it really was. Not as big as 
rex, but ten times worse than 
him. 

It was long and sinuous and it 
had a lor of legs and it stood six 
feet high' or so and was a sort of 
sickish pink. Take a caterpillar 
and magnify it until it’s six feet 
tall, then give it longer legs so 
that it can run instead of crawl 
and hang a death mask dragon’s 
head upon it and you get a faint 
idea. Just a faint idea. 

I t saw me and swung its head 
toward me and made an 
eager whimpering sound and it 
slid along toward me with a side- 
wheeling gait, like a dog when 
it’s running out of balance and 
lop-sided. 

I took one look at it and dug 
in my heels and made so sharp 
a turn that I lost my hat. The 
next thing that I knew, I was 
pelting down the hill behind old 
T yrannosaurus. 

And now I saw that myself and 
rex were not the only things that 
were running down the hill. 
Scattered here and there along 
the hillside were other running 
creatures, most of them in small 
groups and herds, although there 
were some singles. Most of them 
were dinosaurs, but there were 
other things as well. 



SMALL DEER 



135 



I’m sorry I can’t tell you what 
they were, but at that particular 
moment I wasn’t what you might 
call an astute observer. I was 
running for my life, as if the 
flames of hell were lapping at 
my heels. 

I looked around a couple of 
times and that sinuous creature 
was still behind me. He wasn’t 
gaining on me any, although I 
had the feeling that he could if 
he put his mind to it. Matter of 
fact, he didn’t seem to be fol- 
lowing me alone. He was doing a 
lot of weaving back and forth. 
He reminded me of nothing quite 
so much as a faithful farm dog 
bringing in the cattle. But even 
thinking this, it took me a little 
time to realize that was exactly 
what he was — an old farm dog 
bringing in a bunch of assorted 
dinosaurs and one misplaced hu- 
man being. 

At the bottom of the hill I 
looked back again and now that 
I could see the whole slope of the 
hill, I saw that this was a big- 
ger cattle drive than I had imag- 
ined. The entire hill was alive 
with running beasts and behind 
them were a half dozen of the 
pinkish dogs. 

And I knew when I saw this 
that the moving herds I’d seen 
out on the valley floor were not 
migratory herds, but they were 
moving because they were being 
driven — that this was a big 



roundup of some sort, with all 
the reptiles and the dinosaurs 
and myself being driven to a 
common center. 

I knew that my life depended 
on getting lost somehow, and be- 
ing left behind. I had to find a 
place to hide and I had to dive 
into this hiding place without be- 
ing seen. Only trouble was there 
seemed no place to hide. The 
valley floor was naked and noth- 
ing bigger than a mouse could 
have hidden there. 

Ahead of me a good-size swale 
rose up from the level floor and 
I went pelting up it. I was run- 
ning out of wind. My breath was 
getting short and I had pains 
throbbing in my chest and I 
knew I couldn’t run much farth- 
er. 

I reached the top of the swale 
and started down the reverse 
slope. And there, right in front 
of me, was a bush of some sort, 
three feet high or so, bristling 
with thorns. I was too close to 
it and going too fast to even try 
to dodge it, so I did the only 
thing I could — I jumped over 
it. 

But on the other side there 
was no solid ground. There was, 
instead, a hole. I caught just a 
glimpse of it and tried to jerk 
my body to one side, and then 
I was falling in the hole. 

It wasn’t much bigger than I 



136 



GALAXY 



was. It bumped me as I fell and 
I picked up some bruises, then 
landed with a jolt. The fall 
knocked the breath out of me 
and I was doubled over, with my 
arms wrapped about my belly. 

My breath came slowly back 
and the pain subsided and I was 
able to take a look at where I 
was. 

The hole was some three feet 
in diameter and perhaps as much 
as seven deep. It slanted slightly 
toward the forefront of the slope 
and its sides were worn smooth. 
A thin trickle of dirt ran down 
from the edge of it, soil that I 
had loosened and dislodged when 
I had hit the hole. And about half- 
way up was a cluster of small 
rocks, the largest of them about 
the size of a human head, pro- 
jecting more than half their 
width out of the wall. I thought, 
idly, as I looked at them, that 
some day they’d come loose and 
drop into the hole. And at the 
thought I squirmed around a 
little to one side, so that if they 
took a notion to fall I’d not be 
in the line of fire. 

Looking down, I saw that I’d 
not fallen to the bottom of the 
hole, for the hole went on, deep- 
er in the ground. I had come to 
rest at a point where the hole 
curved sharply, to angle back 
beneath the swale top. 

I hadn’t noticed it at first, I 
suppose because I had been too 



shook up, but now I became 
aware of a musky smell. Not an 
overpowering odor, but a sort of 
scent — faintly animal, although 
not quite animal. 

A smooth-sided hole and a 
musky smell — there could be no 
other answer: I had fallen not 
into just an ordinary hole, but 
into a burrow of some sort. And 
it must be the burrow of quite 
an animal, I thought, to be the 
size it was. It would have taken 
something with hefty claws, in- 
deed, to have dug this sort of 
burrow. 

And even as I thought it, I 
heard the rattling and the scrab- 
bling of something coming up the 
burrow, no doubt coming up to 
find out what was going on. 

I did some scrabbling myself. I 
didn’t waste no time. But 
about three feet up I slipped. I 
grabbed for the top of the hole, 
but my fingers slid t’nrough the 
sandy soil and I couldn’t get a 
grip. I shot out my feet and stop- 
ped my slide short of the bottom 
of the hole. And there I was, with 
my back against one side of the 
hole and my feet braced against 
the other, hanging there, half- 
way up the burrow. 

While all the time below me 
the scrabbling and the clicking 
sounds continued. The thing, 
whatever it might be, was getting 
closer, and it was coming fast. 



SMALL DEER 



137 



Right in front of me was the 
nest of rocks sticking from the 
wall. I reached out and grabbed 
the biggest one and jerked and 
it came loose. It was heavier than 
I had figured it would be and I 
almost dropped it, but managed 
to hang on. 

A snout came out of the curve 
in the burrow and thrust itself 
quickly upward in a grabbing 
motion. The jaws opened up and 
they almost filled the burrow 
and they were filled with sharp 
and wicked teeth. 

I didn’t think. I didn’t plan. 
What I did was instinct, I drop- 
ped the rock between my spread- 
out legs straight down into that 
gaping maw. It was a heavy rock 
and it dropped four feet or so 
and went straight between the 
teeth, down into the blackness of 
the throat. When it hit it splash- 
ed and the paws snapped shut 
and the creature backed away. 

How I did it, I don’t know, but 
I got out of the hole. I clawed 
and kicked against the wall and 
heaved my body up and rolled 
out of the' hole onto the naked 
hillside. 

Naked, that is, except for the 
bush with 'the inch-long thorns, 
the one that I’d jumped over be- 
fore i fell into the burrow. It 
was the only cover that there 
was and I made for the upper 
side of it, for by now, I figured, 
the big cattle drive had gone 



past me and if I could get the 
bush between myself and the 
valley side of the swale, ! might 
have a chance. Otherwise, sure 
as hell, one of those dogs would 
see me and would come out to 
bring me in. 

For a while there was no ques- 
tions that they were dinosaur 
herders, they probably couldn’t 
tell the difference betv/een me 
and a dinosaur. 1 was ali've and 
could run and that would qualify 
me. 

There was always the chance, 
of course, that the owner of the 
burrow would come swarming 
out, and if he did I couldn’t stay 
behind the bush. But I rather 
doubted he’d be coming out, not 
right away, at least. It would 
take him a while to get that stone 
out of his throat. 

I crouched behind the bush and 
the sun was hot upon my 
back and, peering 'through the 
branches, I could see, far out on 
the valley floor, the great herd 
of milling beasts. All of them 
had been driven together and 
there they were, running in a 
knotted circle, while outside the 
circle prowled the pinkish dogs 
and something else as well — 
what appeared to be men driv- 
ing tiny cars. The cars and men 
were all of the same color, ,-i sort 
of greenish gray, and the two of 
them, the cars and men, seemed 



138 



GALAXY 



to be a single organism. The men 
didn’t seem to be sitting in the 
cars; they looked as if they grew 
out of the cars, as if they and the 
cars were one. And while the 
cars went zipping along, they 
appeared to have no wheels. It 
was hard to tell, but they seemed 
to travel with the bottom of them 
flat upon the ground, like a snail 
would travel, and as they trav- 
elled, they rippled, as if the body 
of the car were some sort of flow- 
ing muscle. 

1 crouched there watching and 
now. for the first time, I had a 
chance to think about it, to try 
to figure out what was going on. 
I had come here, across more 
than sixty million years, to see 
some dinosaurs, and I sure was 
seeing them, but under what you 
might say were peculiar circum- 
stances. The dinosaurs fit, all 
right. They looked mostly like 
the way they looked in books, 
but the dogs and car-men were 
something else again. They were 
distinctly out of place. 

The dogs v/ere pacing back and 
forth, sliding along in their sinu- 
ous fashion, and the car-men 
were zipping back and forth, and 
every once in a while one of the 
beasts would break out of the 
circle and the minute that it did, 
a half dozen dogs and a couple 
of car-men would race to inter- 
cept it and drive it back again. 

The circle of beasts must have 



had roughly, a diameter of a 
mile or more — a mile of milling, 
frightened creatures. A lot of pal- 
eontologists have wondered 
whether dinosaurs had any voice 
and I can tell you that they did. 
They were squealing and roaring 
and quacking and there were 
some of them that hooted — I 
think it was the duckbills hoot- 
ing, but I can’t be sure 

Then, all at once, there was 
another sound, a sort of flutter- 
ing roar that seemed to be com- 
ing from the sky. I looked up 
quickly and I saw them coming 
down — a dozen or so spaceships, 
they couldn’t have been anything 
but spaceships. They came down 
rather fast and they didn’t seem 
too big and there were tails of 
thin, blue flame flickering at 
their bases. Not the billowing 
clouds of flame and smoke that 
our rockets have, but just a thin 
blue flicker. 

For a minute it looked like 
one of them would land on top 
of me, but then I saw that it was 
too far out. It missed me, mat- 
ter of fact, a good two miles or 
so. It and the others sat down 
in a ring around the milling herd 
out in the valley. 

I should have known what 
would happen out there. It 
was the simplest explanation one 
could think of and it was logical. 
I think, maybe, way deep down. 



SMALL DEER 



139 



I did know, but my surface mind 
had pushed it away because it 
was too matter-of-fact and too 
ordinary. 

Thin snouts spouted from the 
ships and purple fire curled mist- 
ily at the muzzle of those snouts 
and the dinosaurs went down in 
a fighting, frightened, squealing 
mass. Thin trickles of vapor 
drifted upward from the snouts 
and out in the center of the circle 
lay that heap of dead and dying 
dinosaurs, all those thousands of 
dinosaurs piled in death. 

It is a simple thing to tell, of 
course, but it was a terrible thing 
to see. I crouched there behind 
the bush, sickened at the sight, 
startled by the silence when all 
the screaming and the squealing 
and the hooting ceased. And 
shaken, too — not by what shakes 
me now as I write this letter, but 
shaken by the knowledge that 
something from outside could do 
this to the earth. 

For they were from outside. It 
wasn’t just the spaceships, but 
those pinkish dogs and gray- 
green car-men which were not 
cars and men, but a single organ- 
ism, were not things cf earth, 
could not be things of earth. 

I crept back from the bush, 
keeping low in hope that the 
bush would screen me from the 
things down in the valley until I 
reached the swale top. One of 
the dogs swung around and look- 



ed my way and I froze, and after 
a time he looked away. 

Then I was over the top of the 
swale and heading back toward 
the time machine. But half way 
down the slope, I turned around 
and came back again, crawling 
on my belly, squirming to the 
hilltop to have another look. 

It was a look I’ll not forget. 

The dogs and car-men had 
swarmed in upon the heap of 
dead dinosaurs, and some cf the 
cars already v.'ere crawling back 
toward the grounded spaceships, 
which had let down ramps. The 
cars were moving slowly, for 
they were heavily loaded and the 
loads they carried were neatly 
butchered hams and racks of 
ribs. 

And in the sky there was a 
muttering and I looked up to see 
yet other spaceships coming 
down — the little transport ships 
that would carry this cargo of 
fresh meat up to another larger 
ship that waited overhead. 

It was then I turned and ran. 

I reached the top of the hill 
and piled into the time machine 
and set it at zero and came 
home. I didn’t even stop to hunt 
for the binoculars I’d dropped. 

A nd now that I am home, I’m 
not going back again. I’m 
not going anywhere in that time 
machine. I’m afraid of what I 
might find any place I go. If 



140 



GALAXY 



Wyalusing College has any need 
of it, I’ll give them the time ma- 
chine. 

But that’s not why I wrote. 

There is no doubt in my mind 
what happened to the dinosaurs, 
why they became extinct. They 
were killed off and butchered 
and hauled away, to some other 
planet, perhaps many light years 
distant, by a race which looked 
upon the earth as a cattle range 
— a planet that could supply a 
vast amount of cheap protein. 

But that, you say, happened 
more than sixty million years 
ago. This race did once exist. But 
in sixty million years it would 
almost certainly have changed its 
ways or drifted off in its hunting 
to some other sector of the gal- 
axy, or, perhaps, have become 
extinct, like the dinosaurs. 

But I don’t think so. I don’t 
think any of those things hap- 
pened. I think they’re still 
around. I think earth may be 
only one of many planets which 
supply their food. 

And I’ll tell you why I think 
so. They were back on earth 
again, I’m sure, some 10,000 or 
1 1 ,000 years ago, when they 
killed off the mammoth and the 
mastodon, the giant bison, the 
great cave bear and the sabre- 
tooth and a lot of other things. 
Oh, yes, I know they missed Af- 
rica. They never touc.hed the big 
game there. Maybe, after wiping 



out the dinosaurs, they learned 
their lesson, and left Africa for 
breeding stock. 

And now I come to the point 
of this letter, the thing that has 
me worried. 

Today there are just a few less 
than three billion of us humans 
in the world. By the year 2,000 
tliere may be as many as six bil- 
lion of us. 

We’re pretty small, of course, 
and these things went in for ton- 
nage, for dinosaurs and mastodon 
and such. But there are so many 
of us! Small as we are, we may 
be getting to the point where 
we’ll be worth their while.

Some of them were on their way 
out, but these were isolated in- 
firmities: a commercially fool- 
ish editorial policy in one in- 
stance, the publisher’s personal 
circumstances in another. As a 
group they were promising, 



though they were essentially 
one-man operations started by 
people who had scraped together 
a little capital or credit. In some 
hope of profit, they were in the 
business of reprinting what each 
personally considered the best 
magazine science fiction pub- 
lished to that date. 

What they produced was var- 
ious. It varied from one com- 
pany’s systematic resurrection of 
every big name undermined by 
the new techniques of the 1940s 
Astounding, through Hadley’s 
editions of such interesting but 
idiosyncratic pieces as L. Ron 
Hubbard’s Final Blackout, to 
Arkham House’s beautifully 
made volumes not only of How- 
ard Phillips Lovecraft but of 
A. E. van Vogt’s Sian and Ray 
Bradbury’s first and best collec- 
tion, Dark Carnival.

They did most of their business 
by mail order; their ads were 
column inches in the prozines, 
mimeographed pages in the fan- 
zines. But in any largish city you 
could usually find one bookstore 
which was not above stocking one 
copy each for the nut trade, and 
here and there you could find 
booksellers who boasted that 
they specialized in it. 

1950 was about the time when 
book review columns became reg- 
ular features in the prozines. Be- 
fore that, reviews, like books, 
had been occasional pieces. They 
had run as fillers at the bottoms 
of pages short on story text, and 
they were often obviously too 
thrilled at the thought that any- 
thing at all had found its way 
into boards. By 1950, the volume 
had not only gotten high enough 
to justify regular columns, it 
had gotten high enough to justify 
a nice cathartic bent of expres- 
sion when a bad one came in, be- 
cause the bad ones were in hope- 
less contrast to the good ones. 

C '’ od grant that such a luxuriant 
' time will never again come 
to science fiction book publish- 
ing. The great board of top- 
rank material waiting to be put 
into books was the bittersweet re- 
sult of persistent neglect. Writers 
had lived, written and died with- 
out ever seeing permanent pub- 
lication. Most of them were not 



specially conscious of great de- 
privation in this area, however 
— not very many people knew 
the area existed. It was entirely 
possible to be a science-fiction 
fan in 1945 and not realize that 
there had been a Golden Age 
just before World War II; it was 
only when these books began 
coming out that the shape and 
nature of that work became fully 
apparent. 

I would not want you to think 
that I believe some cosmic switch 
had clicked over in 1939 and 
then back in 1944. Neither is it 
true that between these arbi- 
trary dates Astounding Science 
Fiction published seventy-two 
issues of solid immortal litera- 
ture while none of its competi- 
tors did a thing but move in 
place. What Astounding did do, 
over a period of years, was to 
develop and, until 1950, keep 
writers who fairly often wrote a 
certain broad type of story well. 
It was a type of story which was 
better received by articulate sci- 
ence-fiction readers of those days 
than was any other type of story; 
those same readers were now 
ready to buy these same stories 
again in book form, and it so hap- 
pened that a good number of peo- 
ple who had never read that kind 
of science fiction before were able 
to share their taste. 

The ASF “Golden Age” in sci- 
ence fiction had been slightly an- 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



143 



ticipated by a similar phenome- 
non in crime fiction, with Dashiell 
Hammett and Raymond Chan- 
dler, among others, emerging 
from the crumbled pages of Black 
Mask. Apparently something just 
before the War acted to create 
pulp writers who were willing to 
break out of the post-World War 
I shell of neverland cliches which 
persisted in the pulps until the 
middle of the 1930s. It may have 
been an echo of the same tough 
attitude toward life that had 
produced Hemingway and Stein- 
beck in the “mainstream” some- 
what earlier. Crime stories in the 
new mode had been getting ser- 
ious book publishing attention 
all during World War II. Now 
it was perhaps science fiction’s 
turn. The material was there. The 
new publishers picked it up and 
made books of it. 

Fantasy Press went back a lit- 
tle farther, to publish the early 
E.E. Smith and Stanley Wein- 
baum as well as other forerun- 
ners of “modern” science fiction 
as these same book publishers 
now proceeded to define it, creat- 
ing sharp distinctions from the 
past, and from Flash Gordon, 
simply by running full notices of 
previous publication and thus 
making it clear where the “good” 
— the most readable — material 
had come from. Centering their 
attention exactly on the Camp- 
bellian writers were Gnome Press 



and Shasta; while Shasta brought 
out Heinlein’s Future History se- 
ries, for example. Gnome was 
busy doing Asimov’s Foundation 
stories. Arkham House, Sian 
aside, was meanwhile tending 
toward selections from such 
fantasy magazines as Weird 
Tales and Unknown, which had 
had little golden ages of their 
own and which Fantasy Press’s 
program also included. Prime 
Press did a little of both, in- 
cluding collections by Lester del 
Rey ( . .And Some Were Hu- 
man) and Theodore Sturgeon 
{Without Sorcery) which split 
their sources mainly between As- 
founding and Unknown, and by 
George O. Smith (Fenus Equila- 
teral) which was without peer 
as an example of ASF wiring-dia- 
gram fiction. Shasta brought out 
the Don A. Stuart stories {Who 
Goes There?, Cloak of Aesir), 
and Gnome did Van Vogt’s The 
Mixed Men and Henry Kuttner’s 
Gallegher stories {Robots Have 
No Tails, by “Lewis Padgett”). 

In other words, in the few 
years between the end of the war 
and the earliest 1950s, these var- 
ious people with their varied re- 
sources brought out the books 
which are still the liver and 
lights of any permanent collec- 
tion of good science fiction. Ran- 
dom House had issued its legen- 
dary Healy-McComas anthology, 
Adventures in Time and Space, 



144 



GALAXY 



and Crown had brought out Groff 
Conklin’s A Treasury of Science 
Fiction, but Gnome had counter- 
ed with Martin Greenberg’s Men 
Against the Stars, an entry fully 
qualified to run in that field. 

If it hadn’t been for the houses 
listed in Paragraph One of this 
necessarily breathless history, 
grown up science fiction might 
have taken years to find a per- 
manent place in literature via 
the library catalogues. With the 
few exceptions mentioned imme- 
diately above, the established 
major houses hadn’t touched 
anything but Verne and Wells in 
years, the only significant war- 
time exceptions being Poc’^et’s 
original paperback, The Pocket 
Book of Science Fiction, and Vik- 
ing’s Portable Novels oj Science. 
Doth of these had been edited 
and one assumes fought into life 
by Donald Wollheim, who has 
gone on to do his impressive job 
of making bricks without stnaw 
for Ace paperbacks. He, Healy 
and McComas, Groff Conklin 
and a few others might eventual- 
ly have succeeded by applying 
unremitting pressure over a 
long period of time. The little 
specialist houses, operating out 
of lofts, book stores and their 
owners’ basements, cut that time 
dramatically short. They made 
the 1950s into boom year . 
from which they themselves 
would draw little but disaster. 



T)y 1951, these people had ac- 
complished two major things, 
both suicidal. They had exhaust- 
ed the supply of easily found, 
high-quality reprints from the 
magazines, and they had estab- 
lished the financial value of the 
sf book market. They had gotten 
to that point because you can 
succeed with almost any sensible 
small venture in publishing as 
long as you’re not doing some- 
thing the potential major com- 
petitors want to do as well. At 
that point, the first Science Fic- 
tion Book Club had appeared on 
the back cover of a prozine. Ex- 
cept for differences of detail, it 
looked and read exactly like its 
sister ads for the Detective Book 
Club, which had been riding the 
back covers of the crime maga- 
zines for years. Merchandising 
had come to the business of pub- 
lishing sf books for profit, and 
the incidence of major company 
names on new sf titles had be- 
gun to rise sharply. 

A major publishing house has, 
by definition, the equipment 
needed to be a major publisher 
— a staff of editorial specialists, 
a production staff which does 
nothing all day but buy supplies 
and services having to do with 
publishing and a sales staff which 
can consist of hundreds of speci- 
alists, some of them out on the 
road calling on bookstore owners 
they have known for years and 

145 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



others sitting home and writing 
punchy brochure copy. This is 
what these people do for a living. 
They have been trained for it un- 
der the impetus of believing that 
this is all they can do for a liv- 
ing. They are paid to do their 
one thing at least as well as their 
opposite numbers at the next ma- 
jor house. With this sort of or- 
ganization, it is possible to pro- 
duce a million copies of some- 
thing that may look and be frac- 
tionally better than the work of 
one busy man working for him- 
self. If you have a hundred such 
specialists, they can produce, say, 
ten times as many things to make 
a million copies of. 

Once such a major organization 
has been put in train, it is com- 
mitted by the inertia of sched- 
ules and capital investment. The 
sight of a major publishing com- 
pany winding up to give birth 
to a new program is so impres- 
sive that few of its rivals can 
restrain themselves from follow- 
ing suit. Once the herd has been 
set in motion it must, by the 
nature of the beast, proceed along 
the line of least resistance for an 
indefinite period of time, leaving 
nothing in its wake but a stubble 
of grasses cropped too short to 
sustain life. 

fn the area of wholesale book- 
JL selling, the brief contention 
was thus between the specialists 

146 



in science fiction and the spe- 
cialists in publishing. In the area 
of simple packaging — of pro- 
ducing at a profit a book which 
appears to be worth the retail 
customer’s money — the contest 
was only a little longer in the 
drawing out. It was in fact ex- 
tended past its natural run by 
something like a happenstance. 
The merchandising machinery 
having gotten turned on, the var- 
ious sales organizations sponsor- 
ed by the major publishers im- 
mediately needed more product 
than the publishers themselves 
were yet able to furnish. So for 
a little while the small houses 
were able to supply copies to the 
book club operations owned more 
or less by their direct competitors. 
Thus they acquired a little more 
money to operate on, at the same 
time that their choice of produc- 
tion standards was sharply nar- 
rowed to the more expensive 
bands of the book-making spec- 
trum. 

What this meant for the retail 
customers was that more con- 
ventional-looking science fiction 
books in far greater quantities 
had become available. Shopping 
for books became considerably 
more convenient. Book prices 
were reduced, in several senses; 
over the short terms, there was 
the benefit of having the speci- 
alist houses throw their stocks 
on the cut-rate market in an 



GALAXY 



effort to get hold of additional 
working capital or simply to bail 
out. Over the long term, book 
prices were reduced (not abso- 
lutely, but relative to the still 
rising cost of production) by the 
combination of high-volume sales 
and production economies of 
which only major publishers are 
capable. 

In fact, the only place the sf 
book-reading public lost anything 
tangible at all was one from 
which the small publishers could 
not have rescued them, but from 
which the big publishers could. 
That was in the paucity of re- 
maining publishable book-length 
material. The result was that the 
middle 1950s v/ere bad years for 
quality, and looked worse by 
comparison to the immediate 
past. 

The middle 1950s were the 
years in which we got the 
“novels” pasted together from se- 
ries short stories, the “science fic- 
tion” by outside writers who had 
obviously seen a monster movie 
once and the unfortunate experi- 
ments in hapless antiquarianism 
reminiscent of that pioneering 
California company which had 
staked its all on Ralph Milne 
Farley. 

These were the years in which 
knowledgeable critics lambasted 
the major companies day and 
night. If Gnome Press had been 
able to bring out Isaac Asimov’s 

GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



I, Robot, why in Heaven’s name 
couldn’t a giant outfit like Dou- 
bleday do better than Nelson 
Bond’s Lancelot Biggs series dis- 
guised as a novel? Answer, Dou- 
bleday wasn’t about to do I, Ro- 
bot — yet. Gnome’s excellently 
manufactured edition, with its 
flossy Cartier jacket making it 
look exactly like a big-time book, 
was still very much on sale. Dou- 
bleday would of course get to 
it in the course of time, but mean- 
while there was Max Ehrlich’s 
The Big Eye, and that was 
science fiction too. You could tell 
by the rocket on the title page. 

I t wasn’t all bad. Gnome’s City, 
by Clifford Simak, was the 
outstanding example of a pasteup 
that had been begging to be done. 
Doubleday’s The Martian Chro- 
nicles dates from that time — a 
beautiful Bradbury collection 
which owes part of its charm to 
the loose connecting passages be- 
tween stories, which may be the 
fragile vestiges of earlier plans 
to make a novel. Simon 85 
Schuster did take the bit in its 
teeth and publish an edition 
of Sian. Grossett 85 Dunlap 
came out with a mass-priced 
edition of Henry Kuttner’s Fury. 
Frederick Fell, hitherto known 
as the promulgator of Oscar J. 
Friend’s The Kid from Mars — 
which is not quite as bad as its 
title — began publishing the 

147 



Bleiler-Dikty annual ‘best” col- 
lections of magazine stories, 
whic/i served the function of pro- 
viding the cinderblock base for 
Judith Merril to later build big- 
ger and better for Simon 86 
Schuster and Dell. And Twayne, 
another small but nevertheless 
full-scale publisher wh., hoped to 
ride up among the majors on the 
strength of this new boom, did 
something very interesting with 
its “Triplet” series, fostered by 
Fletcher Pratt and Dr. John D. 
Clark. 

These were anthologies of 
three novellas each by three ma- 
jor sf writers, who were given a 
loose outline of a basic story 
problem and a detailed descrip- 
tion of the solar system in which 
it was to occur, each writer then 
going his own way as he saw fit. 
This was one attempt to create 
books. With all the will and bud- 
get in the world, the science-fic- 
tion magazines of that time could 
only supply the best of the new 
gout of wordage the book pub- 
lishers now needed as they jock- 
eyed for control of the market. 
They couldn’t supply all of it, by 
a long shot. 

Perforce, the book publishers 
had to be willing to pay enough 
for original material so that good 
writers could be induced to oc- 
casionally forego the magazines 
as a primary market 

No publisher in the world ever 



pays more than he has to, but the 
major publishers have people 
trained to pay that minimum 
with checks drawn on impres- 
sive banks, and with cheerily 
mesmerrhetic references to the 
freemasonry of the arts. In this 
case the book publishers were not 
only broadening the primary 
market for original sf, they were 
now applying the coup de grace 
to the little specialists, as well as 
.shaking off the coattail riders in 
their own ranks. 

Twayne was one oi the com- 
panies which dropped out of the 
picture. But its program left 
some significant orphans. Among 
the ultimate results of Fletcher 
Pratt’s brainchild was James 
Blish’s Hugo-winning A Case oj 
Conscience, which ran as a long 
one-parter in If before expanding 
up to its prize book length. Two 
other Twayne stories, an Asimov 
and a Poul Anderson, appeared 
as serials in Astounding. In its 
own leflhanded way, this was the 
first major case of important 
work being fed from a book pub- 
lisher into the magazines — a 
complete reversal of the estab- 
lished precedence. 

A t about this same time, two 

^ other interesting things hap- 
pened. 

A publisher of paperback 
originals got on the stands with 
his edition of a middling-impor- 



148 



GALAXY 



tant novel before it had finished 
running as a serial in Astound- 
ing. And Doubleday published 
Cyril Kornbluth’s Takeoff, a ma- 
jor novel by a major magazine 
writer, which had seen no maga- 
zine publication at all. 

After the inevitable stumbling 
start, the big book houses were 
getting their programs into full 
flight. In every other impor- 
tant field of magazine fiction, 
most of the long serials had in 
fact been already under contract 
as books. That had now become 
the situation in science fiction, as 
well, and with various ups and 
downs, that is the situation today. 
In all, it took the major houses 
about five years, from 1950 to 
1955, to make it so. 

After ten years, this pendulum 
may now be getting ready to 
swing back the other v/ay. Too 
many new (novels) are not form- 
er magazine serials — however 
arrived at — but puffed-up nove- 
lettes. Some of them were books 
all along, cut down for magazine 
use. But by far the greater per- 
centage are not — they are pad- 
ded, patched together or pub- 
lished in a design form that 
makes a lousy forty thousand 
words stretch across too many 
pages which are mostly margin 
and elephantiasical type. They 
are sometimes written by third- 
rate writers who are being over- 
paid in compensation for missing 

GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



the apprenticeship that magazine 
work forces on its steady practi- 
tioners. These flat souffles are 
in turn subjected to the atten- 
tions of blurb writers and sales 
promotion directors who des- 
cribe and package them to be 
more attractive and rewarding 
than they really are. 

It is my fervent hope that 
these easy promises will have 
their effect; that the second or 
third time the customer is in- 
duced to part with four dollars 
for a two-dollar experience, a 
certain chill will settle over the 
romance. 

In looking over the titles pro- 
duced by the pioneers of 1950 — 
not all of whom were honest 
men with the look of far hori- 
zons in their eyes, and some of 
whom rooked their customers 
and writers unmercifully, some- 
times from sheer naivete — one 
is struck by how odd a profession- 
al production man for, say, Big- 
gers 8s Better & Sons Co. would 
find them. He might forgive them 
for the early “hardcover” book 
which was bound in limp lea::iier 
by the only bindery in town and 
looks exactly like a bible, or for 
the jobs which were obviously 
done on flatbed weekly newspa- 
per presses. He might under- 
stand that the publishers were 
limited in their choices of pro- 
duction methods and sources of 
supply for such things as paper 

149 



and binding cloth. He, a book 
designer and a professional pack- 
et copywriter might have the 
patience to understand that the 
publishers of these books had to 
handle those functions them- 
selves and could not really be 
faulted for not having as much 
esthetic sense or writing ability 
as they had editorial judgment 
. 01 whatever it was they had. 

It is after all a truism in big- 
time publishing that talent is ex- 
actly as deep as frosted glass par- 
tition. What would puzzle and 
dismay the production man would 
be the frequent appearance of 
expensive interior halftone illus- 
strations — often done in the 
publisher’s best self-taught style 
— tipped in on expensive en- 
ameled stock; the use of opulent 
text papers, of foundry type, of 
cut initials, of attempts at full- 
color reproduction of jacket de- 
signs which were often even 
worse than the interior illustra- 
tions. 

These were struggling people. 
They typed their own invoices, 
wrapped their own product and 
stood in line at the post office 
to mail it, walking back to their 
thirty-dollar-a-month offices with 
sheafs of stamps sticking out of 
their shirt pockets. Almost to a 
man, they thought they could 
solve problems that have wreck- 
ed the careers of professional 
specialists, and almost to a man 

150 



they didn’t even realize they had 
failed. They didn’t even know, 
beyond a vague sense of some- 
thing not quite right, why their 
books felt harder to read than a 
similar text composed and de- 
signed by a man drawing fifteen 
grand a year from Biggers Sa Bet- 
ter — mostly for having on file 
the phone numbers of all the dis- 
play type houses in town. 

They weren’t all like that, of 
course. The bigger outfits, like 
Gnome and Shasta, farmed out 
most of these problems to com- 
mercial book manufacturers. Ark- 
ham House and Fantasy Press 
books are distinguishable from 
today’s commercial products by 
the simple fact that they are 
among the best-looking items in 
your library. But there is not one 
in which the careful eye will not 
detect some trace of ingenuous- 
ness, some certain sign that the 
publisher concerned was copying 
what he remembered from the 
books of his youth — the J. Al- 
len St. John illustrations in his 
pre-War Grossett 8e Dunlap Tar- 
zan books, the creamy paper of 
the days when pulp forests were 
not yet the property of news- 
paper cartels. 

These are the things that catch 
the eye as one leafs through one 
of these productions. They are 
the signs of love, dreams and 
spirit, even among the scoundrels.

They were fearing our world 
down atour. ^ i,:. Too ban' they 

weren't tearing us down tool 



tt^"T^hey don’t build slums like 
they used to,” VVhitey 
Edwards told me, reaching up 
for a loose corner of the flexo 
and pulling it down to prove his 
point. It domed springily over 
our dreg-bottomed coffee cups, 
revealing in the hidden space 
behind it the limp multicolored 
spaghetti of the utilities piping: 
gas, water, metered syntho-milk, 
sewage, coaxed TV, med-mist, 
Musik, robo-talk, robo-juice, 
tele, vele, elec, gelec, and such. 
Few of them running fat with 
their peculiar contributions to 
the good life, I judged. 

“That may be so,” I answer- 



ed, slapping aside the dodderer’s 
hands and thumbing the blue 
elastic panel back in place with 
a fast rub along its adhesive 
edge. Again it decently covered 
the flaccid tangle of what looked 
like rainbow-hued sheep’s gut 
and rubber unmentionables. “But 
they built Ma like a bull and 
she’ll gore and trample you if 
she finds you tearing down her 
kitchen. It’s bad enough what 
the giant centipedes are doing.” 
The jumbo TV, jammed be- 
tween sink and fridge flickered 
weak and ghostly. A gaggle of 
five-job wives and eight-job men 
were having a closed-end dis- 




cussion of everything in creation 
on the executive patio edge of 
a swimming pool big enough to 
hide a space-to-seabottom cruis- 
er. Their sweet eldritch cackle 
was unintelligible, but their state 
of undress was a slight counter- 
irritant to boredom. 

Whitey Edwards sighed, not 
looking at these suburban god- 
desses, but squinting his rheumy 
eyes against the Monday sun 
coming up like doom over the 
dusty flats between Beatsville 
and the Henleys’ happy if fragile 
little family castle. Earth’s spot- 
ted, spitting, seething star shot 
its angry rays under the great 
awning rigged in front of our 
windows and door. 

“Once,” the old boy said, shak- 
ing the head -topping that gave 
him his name, “they built slums 
solid with steel beams and heavy 
lath and great bloody pipes of 
iron and tile and lead that made 
’em think twice before they tore 
’em down. But now . .” He 
sighed his wheezy grief. Whitey’d 
used to be a con-and-destruc- 
tion worker decades back, be- 
fore the robots took that over, 
before I was born. 

The TV zoomered in on a 
taut little job in bolero jacket 
and loincloth. The sound clear- 
ed for her fast happy words 
“. caring for this pool put 
my husband and I in the pool- 
counselor raquette . and died. 



I started to tell Whitey 1 had 
even more current job-sorrows 
than his. Since Thursday I’d 
been terminated from my street- 
smiler’s job for competing with 
the psychiatrists, robot and hu- 
man, and for all I know with 
the giant centipedes. Just then 
my brother Dick erupted from 
the bed-closets, throwing clothes 
over his sallow nakedness like a 
Gypsy escaping from a Nazi gas 
chamber — or as if he were a 
six-job man at least and not a 
sprint-in-the-gutter one- jobber. 
And with that job only since 
Friday night after being three 
weeks on probationary relief. 

I called sweetly at him, “Are 
you scared a customer vi/ill put 
a gush of quarters into one of 
your metal bandits with her own 
little pinkies if you’re a minute 
late?” 

Dick scowled, gyrating around 
a stubborn trouser leg. “Don’t 
you worry, Dickie,” I kejit on. 
“All the women I illicitly psyched 
were as nervous of machinery as 
sex, they wanted a man to do it 
for them.” 

Society, graciously, used to let 
people work vending and other 
coin - operated machines, like 
laundromats. But now, like laun- 
dromats too, you have to pay 
an attendant to do it for you — 
because machines are tempera- 
mental and individual enterprise 
is almost as holy as money and

anyway, there aren’t enough jobs 
to go around more than two or 
three times. 

Dick groggled something at me 
and got the door open, all set 
for a spring-heel take-off. But 
there in his way was a tiny 
man, dressed like a respectable 
beetle, with dimpled fist raised 
to knock. He had glasses with 
zoomer lenses; silver antennae 
quivered out of his gray hat; a 
flat black belly-box was his ven- 
tral carapace. He looked around, 
especially at the cluttered floor, 
as if we were a touch unsavory, 
but he held his ground. 

As Dick paused at this col- 
eopterous apparition, Ma came 
charging out of the bed-closets, 
red in the face and black was 
the rest of her. She grappled 
Dick around the elbows and roar- 
ed, “Stop! No son of mine is 
going out to give battle to the 
21st Century on an empty stom- 
ach.” Grabbing a quarter orange 
she shoved it between his teeth 
like a boxer’s mouthpiece and 
then snatching this way and that 
she slammed a sandwich in his 
one hand and a cup in the other 
and on the next time around 
poured it steaming full. 

"VTo one can deny that Ma 

^ stands squarely in back of 
her four sons, like the manager 
of a quartet of fistic champions, 
conscious of our genius and de- 



termined that it get recognition 
in the form of seven- or eight - 
job careers. Though at the mo- 
ment Dick was the only one of 
us with any job at all, except 
for Tom, who lives away with his 
wife and two kids. But obstruc- 
tions and set-backs never daunt 
Ma. It’s not the money she’s 
after, mostly, it’s the glory of 
the House of Henley pitted 
against the whole bloody world. 

Pricked by tender filial warmth 
I eyed her — a murderous son- 
punishing behemoth but my 
blessed mother — while Whitey 
gave her an unseen wave. He’s 
an old admirer she tolerates ever 
since Pa recognized her superior 
nuclear power and died. 

Dick bit out and swallowed 
the meat of the orange and ton- 
gued aside the peel so as to yell 
that the coffee was burning his 
hand and what would it do to 
his throat? Ma ripped the fridge 
open against the pull of the 
great spring I’d fixed outside to 
keep it shut since the latch 
broke. She whisked out an ice- 
cube and tucked it in Dick’s cup. 
The fridge door thudded shut 
and the spring whirred like a 
rattlesnake about to jump loose 
and strike, but it didn’t. 

Then Dick gulped his coffee 
while Ma held him and screech- 
ed in his ear about using lunch 
hour to scout for a second job 
and not stalk girls. When he’d

finished his drink, she gagged 
him with his sandwich and let 
him go. 

The beetle-man dodged aside. 
Dick took off with a straight- 
line velocity that would have 
broken his neck and scattered 
his bones if we’d still been living 
on the twentieth floor and not 
in this ground-level flat they 
tricked us into exchanging for. 

The TV blinked and — presto 
— there was a soldierly file of 
eight-job men (tabbed for that 
by the digit on their left shoul- 
der) single-footing with pleasant 
monotony past the golden plas- 
tic statue of a twelve- jobber. 
Each as he reached screen-cen- 
ter turned head and shouted an 
inaudible by optimistic some- 
thing at me and bared all his 
perfectly tended teeth in a daz- 
zling grin. 

I breathed a happy sigh and 
got set for a spell of quiet 
— at least until the centipedes 
decided to start scuttling — but 
just then the beetle-man poked 
his head in and piped politely 
at Ma, “Good morning, Mrs. 
Henley, I’m your area med stat- 
istician, come to take your blood- 
pressure and photo-snap your 
insides and all for posterity, like 
we arranged for a week ago.” 

Ma slowly turned her head and 
glared at him like a bull that 
spots the matador, or, more like- 



ly, a peanut-vendor strolling 
across the ring. The red in her 
face went purple and she slowly 
reached for the bubbling coffee 
flask and slowly lifted it. The 
beetle-man innocently watched 
the lethal globe ascend with its 
tip-tilting seething brown hemi- 
core, as if all this were a job- 
indoctrination demonstration in 
astrophysics. 

Whitey started up, but I push- 
ed him back in his chair, saying 
rapidly, “Not you. Even being 
an old friend of the family 
wouldn’t save you from the horns 
at this moment.” 

Then I rasped loud as ambu- 
lance-brakes at Ma, “Hold your 
hand, you murdering old frump!” 

She turned at once, as I’d 
known she would. I cited her 
and she charged me with the 
coffee flask high, very much like 
a small Miura, but armed in a 
fashion to have made Manolete 
himself turn pale. But I slipped 
her with a half veronica and as 
she went past I kissed her low 
on the back of the neck, Just at 
the spot where the matador’s 
sword goes in. I whisked my 
arms around her beloved thick 
waist, and the next instant she 
and Whitey and I were as happy 
as tin larks together flitting 
through a sparkling star cluster, 
and she was pouring fresh tof- 
fee for us. 

But the bettle-man, never 



154

dreaming the deadly peril he’d 
been in, advanced another step 
into the kitchen and called, “Mrs. 
Henley, it’s very needful you 
have your medical inspection. 
You’re distorting area med stat- 
istics and there are drastic pen- 
alties for evading med census. 
No need for you to undress, just 
hold still now — ” 

I pushed the coffee flask back 
against the wall and I stroked 
Ma as I held her tight, so she 
didn’t go quite as purple as she 
howled at him, “You filthy med- 
spy! — do you think I’ll submit 
to your peepings and be stuff for 
your filt'ny pictures when I’m 
not granted decent human med 
service if I do sicken? Here I 
have four grand sons, supermen 
all — Meaghan here, who’s a 
master mind doctor, and Harry 
who’s still in bed, the greatest 
poet in the world, and Dick the 
Prince of Personalities, whom 
you saw speeding to work and I 
need not comment on, and Tom, 
who’s a bloody wonder — and 
the filthy world takes so little 
note of them that if I go to the 
clinic it’s only robot doctors 
who’ll see me and never a flesh- 
and-blood physician!” 

Whatever the topic of her rant, 
Ma always gets in a commercial 
for her boys. 

The beetle-man quivered back 
a little at all that, but not very 



far, and piped soothingly, “Mrs. 
Henley, there’s nothing vulgar or 
inferior about robo med. The 
Secretary of Mental Health him- 
self prefers — ” he started to take 
another step into the room. 

“That old sham!” Ma roared, 
palpitating in my grasp and 
purpling dark. “He’s the same 
one whose minions are forever 
sentencing my genius son Harry 
to the clutches of the remedial 
psychiatrists.” 

“But Mrs. Henley,” the little 
fellow went on with rash cour- 
age, “I can see with my own 
eyes you’re not in the best of 
health. An immediate med- 
check — ” 

That gave me my opening and 
I shoved Ma into Whitey’s arms 
and advanced on the beetle-man 
quickly, wavering my finger like 
a sword between his bug eyes. 
“You watch yourself, lad,” I 
cried, “or they’ll be terminating 
you for making diagnoses who 
are only a census-taker. That’s 
what the licensed psychers did 
to me for adding only a few 
words of insight and wisdom Co 
my street-smiling.” 

At that very moment a ghost- 
ly pattering began and swiftly 
grew louder. It seemed to come 
from everywhere. 

“What’s that?” the little chap 
asked wonderingly. 

“The giant centipedes,” I told 
him. 



THE GOOD NEW DAYS

T T e paled and his zoomered 
eyes searched the shadows 
under table and sink as he scut- 
tled backwards, and just at that 
moment, perhaps from the floor 
being swayed by our movements, 
the great spring on the fridge 
came loose and went klishing 
across the floor very close to 
his feet — a twenty-inch coil of 
gray wire. He leaped for the lin- 
tel of the doorway to hoist him- 
self out of reach of the veno- 
mous monster of his imagination, 
but he missed and fell and went 
leaping off as if old Fu-Manchu’s 
whole blessed menagerie were at 
his heels. In pure pity I follow- 
ed him under the great awning, 
polka -dotted now by the shad- 
ows showing through of the stuff 
pattering down on it, and caught 
up with him just beyond the 
mounting flake-drift. 

“Don’t be frightened,” I told 
him, grappling him gently and 
forcing him to lift his zoomers 
to the ragged-topped wall be- 
hind, now only four to six stories 
high instead of the thirty it had 
been a week ago. Along its roll- 
er coaster margin two sinuous 
many-legged great silver beasties 
scampered, chomping great bites 
out of it and raining the digest- 
ed fragments down from their 
rear ends in concrete cornflakes. 

“Those are the giant centi- 
pedes,” I explained. “Demolish- 
ment robots, only.” 



I was thinking of how Harry 
might make a shuddery poem of 
them: glittery cosmic crawlers 
nibbling the gray rim of infinity, 
eating their way in toward us 
from the ends of the universe — 
when at that instant a weightier 
chunk, rejected by one of the 
creature’s delicate digestive ap- 
paratus, no doubt, came thank- 
ing down like a meteor not four 
feet from us, denting the hard 
ground and raising a geyser of 
dust. The beetle-man darted off 
a dozen more steps while 1 duck- 
ed back under the awning, calling 
to him, “Now be off with you, 
little official, and trouble Ma no 
more. She’s too much for you, 
but let that not cast you down. 
Look on her as a revenant from 
a hardier, crueller age — a duch- 
ess out of place.” 

I ’d no sooner got back in the 
kitchen, where Ma and Whitey 
were chatting over their coffee, 
than Ellie, Dick’s wife, came out 
of the bed-closets full-dressed 
with bright suitcases in her hands 
and a dirty dark look in her 
eyes. She was saying, “Listen all 
of you, for I’ll not tell it twice, 
I’m leaving that one-job no-good 
and going back to my last hus- 
band, who’s still got the three 
jobs I left him with when I 
thought to better myself by en- 
tering this house of mad pride 
and sloth and poets snoring,” and 



156

she brushed past me, the silver 
spring twinging again as she 
chanced to kick it. 

“Meaghan, let her go, who 
can’t appreciate the Prince of 
Personalities,” Ma said to me 
loftily, her color down to lady- 
like bright pink again, but I still 
would have followed and argued 
with Ellie — Dick didn’t deserve 
to be deserted when he’d just 
got a toe on the bottom rung of 
the ladder, which of course was 
why she was leaving him though 
she didn’t know it, a jealous no- 
job little wifey — except that 
just then who should appear in 
the doorway but my eldest broth- 
er, Tom, filling it with his big 
grin and his great shoulders and 
his aura of three-job success — 
or would it be four now? — and 
saying, “Hi, Ma. Ellie leaving 
Dick again? Who’s the tiny one 
hanging around outside? Hous- 
ing official come to coax you 
once more from this death trap? 
Hello, Whitey. No, no coffee, 
Ma, I want to talk to Meaghan 
here. I’ve got something for the 
lad!” 

I knew what that meant, of 
course, and I was already hunch- 
ed on my hands and knees, start- 
ing to fix the spring to the fridge 
again — a job that might easily 
take the rest of the day, I decid- 
ed — when I felt Ma’s kindly tal- 
ons on my shoulders, lifting me 
up, and she saying, “Whitey’U 



fix that, Meaghan,” and then her 
beloved claws were propelling me 
to a seat at the table flush 
against the blue flexo, with my 
cup in front of me and beyond 
that Tom’s great face as full of 
a smile of eager elder-brother 
benignity as my cup was of 
steaming coffee — Ma having 
poured again and dropped in a 
pinch of dexy (I saw her) to 
give me spirit. 

A 11 the while I was thinking 
chiefly. What job’s he found 
now that’s so bad he won’t take 
it himself but offer "^t to me? 
It’d have to be pretty bad, for 
at last count Tom’s three jobs 
were grinding mirrors for leisure- 
time astronomers who hadn’t 
time to grind their own — that’s 
one — and selling retailers a 
brand of all-cornsilk cancer-free 
cigarets with the genuine coal- 
tar taste and the nicotine life — 
that’s two — and answering for 
a robot answering service when- 
ever the decibal-rating of the 
caller’s voice began to indicate 
extreme rage. He still had the 
third job, at any rate, by the 
phone-rig hanging around his 
neck. 

“Meaghan,” he beamed, “next 
to an all-girl squad of revivalist 
angels, there’s naught so won- 
drous as brother-love. I got 
something great for you. By the 
by, I’ve Number Four myself

now — I travel in ladies’ glow- 
in-the-dark underthings.” 

As Ma raised a cheer at that, 
1 looked around for escape, but 
Whitey was squatting at the 
fridge and blocking the door to 
the outer world, as happy with 
his tinkering as a great-grand- 
father cockroach (one of which 
was walking up his leg) while 
Ma, cheering still but with a 
policeman’s eye on me, was tak- 
ing a cup of coffee big and smok- 
ing as a volcano into the bed- 
closets — to fire Harry’s poetic 
genius, no doubt, or in lieu of 
that toss him on his lazy feet. 

“Meaghan — ” Tom began, but 
just then his neck phone rang 
and he twitched it on and I 
could hear a voice like angry 
wasps. Tom listened and his face 
grew pink — he takes after Ma 
in that — and he said, “Certain- 
ly, madam. However — ’’ and 
then his face grew purple and 
he began to bubble his mouth 
like a fish. 

I leaned across the table and 
put my lips to the mouthpiece 
and shouted, “I love you dearly, 
unknown, indeed I do. I love 
you dearly, madam, brood upon 
that,” and I tw'itched the thing 
off. 

“That won’t satisfy her,” Tom 
said when he got his right color 
back and his breath. 

“It will for twenty minutes," 
I told him, “and what in this 



world is good for any longer?” 
And then I added, reckless in 
my light-heartedness, “You were 
saying . .?” 

“Meaghan,” Tom began again, 
“I know you had this trifling 
street-smiler’s job — ” 

“Not so trifling or iittle,” I 
defended, though I hadn’t in- 
tended to. “The sociologists de- 
cided people looked too tense 
and glum going back and forth 
to work and shopping and so on, 
so they hired folk like myself to 
mingle among ’em and strike up 
talk, casual-like, to cheer ’em 
up. Not quite the worst idea in 
the world, either.” 

CC^Tes, but you went too far,” 
Tom reminded me. “You 
pried into people’s minds to find 
their real troubles and set ’em 
straight. That’s psychers’ v/ork, 
my lad, and you can’t blame that 
august profession for resenting 
your competition and having you 
terminated.” 

“I helped the people I talked 
to,” I countered stubbornly. “I 
couldn’t have talked to them at 
all, Tom, if I hadn’t something 
solid to say.” 

“I love you dearly, madam, 
brood upon that,” Tom said. 
“Solid!” 

“I don’t worry ’em or push any 
of their desperation buttons, 
though I glimpsed banks of 
those,” I protested on. “1 just 



158

encouraged ’em to widen their 
minds and feelings a little and 
get some of the comic side-wash 
of others’ troubles and cheer up 
naturally.” 

“There you’ve hit the nub of 
it,” Tom asserted, wagging a fin- 
ger in my face. “You tried to 
deliver more than your job call - 
ed for, instead of learning to do 
it with a minimum of effort and 
finding another job to go with 
it, to swell your income — and 
then another after that.” He gave 
a quick look around — to make 
sure Ma hadn’t come back, I 
soon realized — and then lean- 
ing forward said with a confi- 
dential hush, “Oh, Meaghan, my 
boy, I’ve learned so much of the 
world since I got away from 
here and Ma’s no longer firing 
me with resentments and wild 
ambitions. The world’s a very 
tidy comfortable place if only 
you’ll remember there are three 
billion other lunatic climbers in 
it — and do no more than you’re 
told and watch the smiles .and 
frowns of your superiors and 
keep your eyes open and your 
nostrils flared for flicker or scent 
of another chance to make mon- 
ey. Step fast, keep adding one 
little job to the next like beads 
on a necklace, and forget Ma 
and her wild dreams. Oh and did 
I tell you my Katie’s got two 
jobs herself now too? — and 
never a one she’d have had with , 



Ma around to hold her down.” 
“Ma’s all right,” I told him 
.sharply. “She’s got more courage 
and determination and vision 
than the four of us’ll ever have 
together. And such a fierce self- 
punishing drive I wonder she’s 
still alive. How would you ever 
have got out of here to a place 
of your own without Ma boot- 
ing you?” 

tt'T^rue, true,” he agreed. 

“Nevertheless, Ma’s a 
hopeless romantic. She wants her 
four sons to be Dukes of the 
World, lording it over all.” 

I couldn’t help chuckling at 
that, “When I was still street- 
smiling,” I confided, “a little 
man, who thought he was a 
great romantic, opened his mind 
to me wanting only to escape 
from the prison of his life and 
aim a flashing sword at other 
men and capture with love their 
women — and corral all the sin- 
gle girls going around loose too. 
After we both looked at this 
stirring picture a while, we rea- 
lized that what he really wanted 
was to have all women mother 
him and puff him up and lead 
him through life like a great 
bobbing red balloon.” 

“That’s the way with all ro- 
mantics, including Ma,” Tom 
said, taking advantage of me 
straightway. “She wants her sons 
to be princes and kings, or board 



THE GOOD NEW DAYS

chairmen at all events, not rea- 
lizing there’s a billion others 
starting up the success-ladder 
with them — and not one with 
a genuine ion drive. Not realiz- 
ing that the competition’s too 
stiff for any man to dream of 
being more than an eight-job 
statistic with his peers. Or ten 
at most.” 

The TV now was sailing over 
a great pile of gently crumpled 
bedclothes, which struck me as 
most pleasant and unlikely. Then 
I realized it was orbiting the 
Earth high above the clouds and 
there low in the foreground were 
the backs of beautifully barber- 
ed heads and now a sign flash- 
ing across the clouds: “Vacation 
Jaunts through Space for Nine- 
Job Heroes of Democracy.” 

“You’re right about the com- 
petition,” I agreed quickly with 
Tom. “I’m no enemy of democ- 
racy, I’m one of its darlingest 
friends, but there’s no question 
it’s upped the competition more 
than ever it was in Earth’s his- 
tory. We’ve got more machines, 
more health, more freedom of 
movement, more education, mcwe 
leisure, more time for making 
money in our spare time, more 
almost equal people, and more 
incentives, more quick showy re- 
wards for the quickly successful 
— with the result that the com- 
petition burns us out fast enough 
to equalize all the longevity 



created by medical advance.” 

“It doesn’t seem to be burn- 
ing you out,” Tom observed. 

4<XJow listen here, Tom my 
^ ^ boy,” I continued, warm- 
ing to my subject. “Isn’t there 
something altogether crazy about 
a world that wants to turn every- 
one into merchants no matter 
what their natural psychological 
class — a world that’s turned 
even scientists and poets and 
adventurers and soldiers and 
priests into merchants busy sell- 
ing themselves — a world that’s 
feared so much that the machine 
would take away all jobs that 
it’s gone ape creating jobs and 
financial ventures by the billions. 
With each reduction in working 
hours paralleled by an equal or 
greater increase in time spent on 
part-time and side-line jobs — a 
world that’s so money- conscious 
that a man who takes his eyes 
off the dollar for a month or a 
day or even ten seconds — ” 
“Your eyes don’t look red with 
squinting at silver,” Tom observ- 
ed like a lemon. “Besides, you’re 
deafening me.” 

Just then Ma came lumbering 
daintily in again and asked Tom, 
“What’s this wondrous jo’o 
you’ve got for Meaghan? I can’t 
wait any longer to hear.” Just 
as if she hadn’t been hearing 
every word and writhing at my 
negativisms. 



160 



GALAXY 



I groaned as if on the verge 
of defeat. Tom laughed and 
said, “1 was forgetting about 
that. What with Mea talking 
of billions of jobs, my one gst 
lost in the stampede. Well, it 
seems that the repair robots are 
getting unpredictable every- 
where, spending too much time 
on some jobs and not enough 
on others, and passing up still 
others altogether. One repaired 
a leak so well it built an armor 
wall six feet thick around the 
leak and himself — Fortunata, 
they called that one. Another 
found a leak and did nothing 
but start making identical leaks 
in all the pipes he followed — 
until thousands of them were 
squirting behind him. A demo- 
lition robot started shooting 
rocks at a new-risen glastic 
building. Yet the circuits of these 
robots are in perfect order and 
they always behave properly un- 
der factory tests. So what must 
be done is to have a man follow 
each metal trouble-shooter and 
note every move he makes, 
watch his behavior day after 
day — taking weeks if necessary 
so the robot will get used to 
his presence and not vary his 
behavior to please or confuse or 
harm the watcher. Oh, it’s a 
fine sort of job — no work at all 
— sort of like what they called 
Sidewalk Inspecting back in the 
depths of history.” 



I said, “I suppose the robots 
they’re having the most trou- 
ble with are the ones that re- 
pair heat-tunnels and sewers and 
other delightful underground 
conduits.” 

“How did you know that?” 
Tom asked me very quickly. 
“Old sunken spillways and aqua- 
ducts and chimneys too, though 
— some of the last poking thou- 
sands of feet high into the clear 
heady air. A most healthful job, 
my boyo — a regular mountain- 
climbing and spelunking vaca- 
tion.” 

I said softly, “I think I’d rath- 
er drown parboiled in this coffee 
cup than play psychiatric aide to 
a manic genius robot with a 
breakneck wander-urge who’s 
waiting for his metal conscious- 
ness to brighten with its first 
jeweled unhuman pictures and 
electricity-loving impulses. The 
machines are coming awake, did 
you know that, Tom? All the 
machines — ” 

“No, it’s but one machine,” a 
softer dreamier voice, mournful 
as a breeze through dead leaves, 
cut in on me. The adolescent 
wraith with hair like blond spi- 
derweb, who was Ma’s poet ge- 
nius and my youngest brother 
Harry, came drifting in from the 
bed-closets as if blown rather 
than walking. I could tell from 
the light-year look in his blue 
eyes that he’d conned his re-

medial psycher out of some pills. 

He went on, “The whole Earth 
is one great metal machine, a 
dull steel marble amongst the 
aggies and glassies of the other 
planets. If anyone ever went out 
there with earth-eyes and not a 
spaceman’s, he’d see it rolling 
along, over and over, like a great 
silver shop-made tumblebug 
spotted with cities and wet here 
and there with oceans, blinking 
the eyes of its ice-caps and smok- 
ing its volcanos and folding and 
unfolding its harrow-footed 
space-crazy legs in time with the 
phases of the moon. And if you 
looked real close you’d see mil- 
lions of fleas jumpin’ off it and 
beginning the long fall to the 
nadir.” 

At that moment the TV jump- 
ed to a 24-hour satellite star- 
ward of Terra and showed us 
the whole moonlit Earth backed 
by the Milky Way, as if snared 
by a diamond-dewy spiderweb. 
Ma squeaked a proud sigh at 
Harry’s words thus coming out 
illustrated. 

“Will you take the job?” Tom 
rasped at me. 

“Tomorrow I will for sure,” 
I told him. “And that’s all the 
answer you’ll ever get from me 
— tomorrow or any other day.” 

TV T a tapped her hoof and flash- 
ed a rageful eye at me. 
“Tom,” she said to him, “if 



Meaghan scorns it, how about 
Harry. Think of it, Harry, you 
always claim you want to be 
alone. Roaming those cool tun- 
nels and sewers all by yourself 
except for some witless machine 
you’ll catch onto in ten minutes. 
You’ll have all the time and 
quiet in the world to create your 
poetry. Why, underground your 
poetry will sprout like roots, I’m 
sure, and run fast as crabgrass.” 

“Ma,” Harry said, “sooner 
than take that job I’d head for 
Beatsville today rather than to- 
morrow.” 

“You wouldn’t do that, Har- 
ry,” Ma wailed menacingly. “Tell 
me you wouldn’t.” Ma’s always 
prided herself that no matter 
how slumlike we live and close 
to Beatsville, we’d never get 
there. In Beatsville they pretend 
even worse than in the suburbs, 
pretend to be supermen and pre- 
tend to be animals, and creep 
each night to the electrified 
boundary to pick up the food 
and drink left for them. 

But Harry nodded again and 
then Ma began yelling at Tom 
that he was trying to break up 
what was left of her family, hav- 
ing splintered himself off first. 
Whitey came alive and flapped 
his hands at her cautiously, like 
a torero ready to jump the 
fence. I slitted my eyes as if I 
were falling asleep. Tom got red 
as Ma and said the hell with us,

he was going for good. So Ma 
stamped this way and that, now 
roaring at Harry and me for our, 
sloth, now bellowing at Tom for 
his disloyalty. Then she lifted 
her arms to heaven and froze. 

At that instant the beetle-man 
popped into the doorway and 
pointed his antennae at her. No 
one saw him but me. 

Tom’s face grew redder and 
he gave a snort and turned on 
his heel toward the door just 
as the beetle-man ducked out of 
sight. Tom had no sooner stamp- 
ed out than the beetle-man pop- 
ped in again behind him, waving 
a gray-black transparency he’d 
whipped from his black belly- 
box. 

“Mrs. Henley,” he piped rap- 
idly, “I got a perfect shot of all 
your insides, but that’s all that’s 
perfect about it. You must come 
to the clinic right away with me. 
Your heart’s like a watermelon 
and your aorta and pulmonary 
like summer squash.” He wag- 
gled a finger at me. “Diagnosis 
by a med-spector is permissable 
in dire emergencies.” 

M a’s face went purple. At 
that instant I felt the build- 
ing quiver from the top down 
and a heartbeat later something 
burst through tlie awning and 
struck Tom as if he were a very 
thick spike and it a hammer 
driving him into the ground. 



Ma screamed a great single 
scream and took a step forward 
and then stiffened and fell back 
and I caught her in my arms 
and lowered her to the floor and 
pillowed her head. Outside I 
could hear the beetle-man buzz- 
ing into his neckphone for an 
ambulance like the fool he was 
— for Tom’s head was smashed 
to the neck. Then I was wonder- 
ing how Tom’s blood could have 
got on Ma, for there was blood 
on her chest and then more and 
more of it, like a bull fallen from 
the final thrust and pumping his 
heart out, and then I realized 
it was Ma’s blood from her lungs, 
gurgling with her Cheyne-Stokes 
breathing. 

Whitey came fluttering down 
at her other side. 

Harry was standing looking at 
us and he was trembling, and 
then we heard the siren far off, 
and then another, and then the 
two of them coming closer fast, 
and as they came closer and 
their angry wailing grew louder, 
Harry began to tremble more, 
and as their sound burst into the 
open of the razed blocks, he 
cried, “I’m off to Beatsville,” 
and he was sprinting by the time 
he v,^ent through the door. 

I knew what was coming, al- 
though there was nothing I could 
do but hold Ma. Then I knew 
that what was coming had come, 
for there was a shout and a 



THE GOOD NEW DAYS 



163 



great squealing of brakes and a 
scream and a thud, and the 
brakes still squealing. 

Then Ma stopped breathing, 
but she still looked angry. 

It was a long time before any- 
one came in, I went on holding 
Ma and wiping her face clean, 
though it stayed red for all that. 
I heard one ambulance leave and 
then the other. Finally a doctor 
came in, and the beetle-man too, 
and the doctor looked at Ma 
and shook his head and said that 
if only she’d been med-checked 
regularly it need never have 
happened, but I told him, “You 
didn’t know Ma.” And the 
beetle-man buzzed into his neck- 
phone for an ambulance back. 

I said, chokily, “She died 
brave, charging the muleta dead 
on, and I’m damned if I’ll award 
society a single hoof of her, let 
alone the horns or the tail.” No 
one got it. The beetle-man eyed 
me and took a surreptitious note. 

■''T^hen for a while I was signing 
papers and listening to this 
and that, but finally they were 
all gone, the living and dead, and 
I was alone with Whitey and I 
remembered we ought to tell 
Dick. 

The TV was showing a great 
musical review with hundreds 



of highly talented actors and 
actresses, all of them seven- job 
folk and this the eighth job for 
all of them. Flights of smiles 
were going back and forth across 
the screen, like seagulls wheeling 
at sunset. 

The concrete cornflakes were 
still pattering on the awning. I 
marched us straight under the 
hole the rock had made that 
killed Tom, and they pelted on 
our hair and shoulders and necks 
like feathery hail. 

We climbed the flake-drift and 
I paused and turned round. The 
giant centipedes were busily 
crawling back and forth, the one 
swinging aside most cleverly to 
let the other pass. They’d chew- 
ed their way here and there 
down to the second floor. 

I looked down to our shadow- 
ed doorway with the faintest 
flicker of TV still coming out 
of it, and I thought I’d like to 
drive a nail a mile long down 
through the center of that room, 
pinning it there forever, and en- 
grave in the head of the nail, 
in letters a foot deep, “A Family 
Lived Here.” 

But that was a little beyond 
the scope of my engineering, so 
pushing Whitey ahead of me, off 
I went to tell Dick, laughing and 
crying. — FRITZ LEIBER

GALAXY 



by ISAAC ASIMOV 




Five of them had come fo the pianef. 
Four were dead. The other had only 
one chance left — to live forever! 



''T^he original combination of 
-*■ catastrophes had taken place 
five years ago — five revolutions 
of this planet, HC-12549d by the 
charts, and nameless otherwise. 
Six-plus revolutions of Earth, but 
who was counting — any more? 

If the men back home knew, 
they might say it was a heroic 
fight, an epic of the Galactic 
Corps; five men against a hostile 
world, holding their bitter own 
for five (or six-plus) years. And 
now they were dying, the battle 
lost after all. Three were in final 
coma, a fourth had his yellow- 



tinged eyeballs still open, and a 
fifth was yet on his feet. 

But it was no question of hero- 
ism at all. It had been five men 
fighting off boredom and des- 
pair and maintaining their metal- 
lic bubble of livability only for 
the most unheroic reason that 
there was nothing else to do 
while life remained. 

If any of them felt stimulated 
by the battle, he never mentioned 
it. After the first year, they 
stopped talking of rescue, and 
after the second, a moratorium 
descended on the word, “Earth.” 



165 




But one word remained always 
present. If unspoken it had to be 
found in their thoughts; “Am- 
monia.” 

It bad come first while the 
landing was being scratched out 
against all odds on limping mo- 
tors and in a battered space can. 

You allow for bad breaks, of 
course; you expect a certain 
number — but one at a time. A 
stellar flare fries out the hyper- 
circuits — that can be repaired, 
given time. A meteorite disaligns 
the feeder-valves — they can be 
straightened, given time. A tra- 
jectory is miscalculated under 
tension and a momentarily un- 
bearable acceleration tears out 
the jump-antennae and dulls the 
senses of every man on board — 
but antennae can be replaced 
and senses will recover, given 
time. 

The chances are one in count- 
less many that all three will 
happen at once; and still less 
that they will happen during a 
particularly tricky landing when 
the one necessary currency for 
the correction of all errors, time, 
is the one thing that is most 
lacking. 

'"T^he Cruiser John hit that one 
chance in countless many, 
and it made a final landing, for 
it would never lift off a planetary 
surface again. 

That it had landed essentially 



intact was itself a near-mir u I .- 
The five were given life for scr.ie 
years at least. Beyond that, oaly 
the blundering arrival of another 
ship could help, but no one ex- 
pected that. They had had their 
life’s share of coincidences, they 
knew, and all had been bad. 

That was that. 

And the key word was “am- 
monia.” With the surface spirall- 
ing upward, and death (merciful- 
ly quick) facing them at consider- 
ably better than even odds, Chou 
somehow had time to note the 
absorption spectrograph, which 
was registering raggedly. 

“Ammonia,” he cried out. The 
others heard but there was no 
time to pay attention. There was 
only the wrenching fight against 
a quick death for the sake of a 
slow one. 

When they landed finally, on 
sandy ground with sparse, rag- 
ged bluish vegetation; reedy 
grass; stunted tree-like objects 
with blue bark and no leaves; no 
sign of animal life; and with 
an almost greenish cloud- 
streaked sky above — the word 
came back to haunt them. 

“Ammonia?” said Petersen 
heavily. 

Chou said, “Four percent.” 

“Impossible,” said Petersen. 

But it wasn’t. The books 
didn’t say impossible. What the 
Galactic Corps had discovered 
was that a planet of a certain 



166 



GALAXY 



mass and volume and at a certain 
temperature was an ocean planet 
and had one of two atmospheres; 
nitrogen/oxygen or nitrogen/car- 
bon dioxide. In the former case, 
life was rampant in the latter, it 
was primitive. 

No one checked beyond mass, 
volume and temperature any 
longer. One took the atmosphere 
(one or the other of them) for 
granted. But the books didn’t say 
it had to be so; just that it al- 
ways was so. Other atmospheres 
were thermodynamically pos- 
sible, but extremely unlikely so 
they weren’t found in actual 
practice. 

Until now. The men of the 
Cruiser John had found one and 
were bathed for the rest of such 
life as they could eke out by a 
nitrogen /carbon dioxide/ ammon- 
ia atmosphere. 

'^'^he men converted their ship 
into an underground bubble 
of Earth-type surroundings. 
They could not lift off the sur- 
face, nor could they drive a com- 
municating beam through hyper- 
space, but all else was salvage- 
able. To make up for inefficien- 
cies in the cycling system, they 
could even tap the planet’s own 
water and air supply within lim- 
its; provided, of course, they sub- 
tracted the ammonia. 

They organized exploring par- 
ties since their suits were in ex- 



cellent condition and it passed 
the time. The planet was harm- 
less; no animal life; sparse plant 
life everywhere. Blue, always 
blue ; ammoniated chlorophyll ; 
arnmoniated protein. 

They set up laboratories, an- 
alyzed the plant components, 
studied microscopic sections, 
compiled vast volumes of find- 
ings. They tried growing native 
plants in ammonia-free atmos- 
phere and failed. They made 
themselves into geologists and 
studied the planet’s crust; as- 
tronomers and studied the spec- 
trum of the planet’s sun. 

Barrere would say sometimes, 
“Eventually, the Corps will reach 
this planet again and we’ll leave 
a legacy of knowledge for them. 
It’s a unique planet after all. 
There might not be another 
Earth-type with ammonia in all 
the Milky Way.” 

“Great,” said Sandropoulos, 
bitterly. “What luck for us.” 

Sandropoulos worked out the 
thermodynamics of the situation. 
“A metastable system,” he said. 
“The ammonia disappears stead- 
ily through geochemical oxida- 
tion that forms nitrogen; the 
plants utilize nitrogen and re- 
form ammonia, adapting them- 
selves to the presence of ammon- 
ia. If the rate of plant formation 
of ammonia dropped two per- 
cent, a declining spiral would set 
in. Plant life would wither, re- 



FOUNDING FATHER 



167 



ducing the ammonia still further 
and so on.” 

“You mean if we killed enough 
plant life,” said Vlassov, “we 
could wipe out the ammonia.” 

“If we had air-sleds and wide- 
angle blasters, and a year to work 
in, we might,” said Sandropoulos, 
“but we haven’t and there’s a bet- 
ter way. If we could get our 
plants going, the formation of 
oxygen through photosynthesis 
would increase the rate of am- 
monia oxidation. Even a small 
localized rise would lower the 
ammonia in the region, stimulate 
Earth-plant growth further, and 
inhibit the native growth, drop 
the ammonia further and so on.” 

They became gardeners 
through all the growing season. 
That was, after all, routine for 
the Galactic Corps. Life on 
Earth-type planets was usually 
of the water/protein type, but 
variation was infinite and other- 
world food was rarely nourishing 
and even more often happened 
(not always, but often) that 
some types of Earth-plants 
would overrun and drown out the 
native flora. With the native 
flora held down, other Earth- 
plants could take root. 

T^ozens of planets had been 
converted into new Earths 
in this fashion. In the process 
Earth-plants developed hundreds 
of hardy varieties that flourished 



under extreme condition.s — All 
the better with which to seed the 
next planet. 

The ammonia would kill any 
Earth-plant, but the seeds at the 
disposal of the Cruiser John were 
not true Earth-plants but other- 
world mutations of these plants. 
They fought hard but not well 
enough. Some varieties grew in a 
feeble, sickly manner and died. 

At that they did better than 
did microscopic life. The planet’s 
bacterioids were far more flour- 
ishing than was the planet’s 
straggly blue plant-life. The na- 
tive microorganisms drowned out 
any attempt at competition from 
Earth-samples. The attempt to 
seed the alien soil with Earth- 
type bacterial flora in order to 
aid the Earth-plants failed. 

Vlassov shook his head, “It 
wouldn’t do anyway. If our bac- 
teria survived, it would only be 
by adapting to the presence of 
ammonia.” 

Sandropoulos said, “Bacteria 
won’t help us. We need the 
plants ; they carry the oxygen 
manufacturing systems.” 

“We could make some our- 
selves,” said Petersen. “We could 
electrolyze water.” 

“How long will our equipment 
last? If we could only get our 
plants going it would be like elec- 
trolyzing water forever, little by 
little, but year after year, till the 
planet gave up.” 



168 



GALAXY 



Barrere said, “Let’s treat the 
soil then. It’s rotten with am- 
nnK)nium salts. We’ll bake the 
salts out and replace the ammon- 
ia-free soil.” 

“And what about the atmos- 
phere?” asked Chou. 

“In ammonia-free soil, they 
may catch hold despite the at- 
mosphere. They almost make it 
as is.” 

They worked like longshore- 
men, but with no real end in 
view. None really thought it 
would work, and there was no 
future for themselves, personally, 
even if it did work. But working 
passed the days. 

The next growing season, they 
had their ammonia-free soil, but 
Earth-plants still grew only feeb- 
ly. They even placed domes over 
several shoots and pumped am- 
monia-free air within. It helped 
slightly but not enough. They ad- 
justed the chemical composition 
of the soil in every possible fash- 
ion. There was no reward. 

The feeble shoots produced 
their tiny whiffs of oxygen, but 
not enough to topple the am- 
monia atmosphere off its base. 

“One more push,” said San- 
dropoulos, “one more. We’re 
rocking it; we’re rocking it; but 
we can’t knock it over.” 

''T^heir tools and equipment 
blunted and wore out with 
time and the future closed in 



steadily. Each month there was 
less room for maneuver. 

When the end came at last, it 
was with almost gratifying sud- 
denness. There was no name to 
place on the weakness and ver- 
tigo. No one actually suspected 
direct ammonia poisoning. Still, 
they were living off the algal 
growth of what had once been 
ship-hydroponics for years and 
the growths were themselves 
aberrant with possible ammonia 
contamination. 

It could have been the work- 
ings of some native microorgan- 
ism which might finally have 
learned to feed off them. It might 
even have been an Earthly mic- 
roorganism, mutated under the 
conditions of a strange world. 

So three died at last and did 
so, circumstances be praised, 
painlessly. They were glad to 
go, and leave the useless fight. 

Chou said, in a voiceless whis- 
per, “It’s foolish to lose so bad- 
ly.” 

Petersen, alone of the five to 
be on his feet (was he immune, 
whatever it was?) turned a griev- 
ing face toward his only living 
companion. 

“Don’t die,” he said, “don’t 
leave me alone.” 

Chou tried to smile. “I have 
no choice. But you can follow us, 
old friend. Why fight? The tools 
are gone and there is no way of 
winning now, if there ever was.” 



FOUNDING FATHER 



169 



Even now, Petersen fought off 
final despair by concentrating on 
the fight against the atmosphere. 
But his mind was weary, his 
heart worn out, and when Chou 
died the next hour, he was left 
with four corpses to work with. 

He stared at the bodies, count- 
ing over the memories, stretching 
them back (now that he was 
alone and dared wail) to Earth 
itself, which he had last seen on 
a visit eleven years before. 

He would have to bury the 
bodies He would break off the 
bluish branches of the native 
leafless trees and build crosses 
of them. He would hang the 
space helmet of each man on top 
and prop the oxygen cylinders 
below. Empty cylinders to sym- 
bolize the lost fight. 

A foolish sentiment for men 
who could no longer care, and 
for future eyes that might never 
see. 

But he was doing it for him- 
self, to show respect for his 
friends, and respect for himself, 
too, for he was not the kind of 
man to leave his friends untend- 
ed in death while he himself 
could stand. 

Besides — 

Besides? He sat in weary 
thought for some moments. 

While he was still alive, he 
would fight with such tools as 
were left. He would bury his 
friends. 



T T e buried each in a spot of 
^ ^ ammonia-free soil they had 
so laboriously built up; buried 
them without shroud and with- 
out clothing; leaving them naked 
in the hostile ground for the slow 
decomposition that would come 
with' their own microorganisms 
before those, too, died with the 
inevitable invasion of the native 
bacterioids. 

Petersen placed each cross, 
with its helmet and oxygen cylin- 
ders, propped each with rocks 
then turned away, grim and sad- 
eyed, to return to the buried ship 
that he now inhabited alone. 

He worked each day and even- 
tually the symptoms came for 
him, too. 

He struggled into his space 
suit and came to the surface for 
what he knew would be one last 
time. 

He fell to his knees on the 
garden-plots. The Earth plants 
were green. They had lived 
longer than ever before. They 
looked healthy, even vigorous. 

They had patched the soil, 
babied the atmosphere, and now 
Petersen had used the last tool, 
the only one remaining at his dis- 
posal, and he had given them fer- 
tilizer as well — 

Out of the slowly corrupting 
flesh of the Earthmen came the 
nutrients that supplied the final 
push. Out of the Earth-plants 
came the oxygen that would beat 



170 



GALAXY 



back the ammonia and push the 
planet out of the unaccountable 
niche into which it had stuck. 

If Earthmen ever came again 
(when? a million years hence?) 
they would find a nitrogen/oxy- 
gen atmosphere and a limited 
flora strangely reminiscent of 
Earth’s. 

The crosses would rot and de- 
cay, the metal rust and decom- 
pose. The bones might fossilize 



and remain to give a hint as to 
what happened. Their own rec- 
ords, sealed away, might be 
found. 

But none of that mattered. If 
nothing at all was ever found, 
the planet itself, the whole 
planet, would be their monu- 
ment. 

And Petersen lay down to die 
in the midst of their victory.

FORECAST 

Actually our editorial this month is our forecast, but it's on a some- 
whdt longer-range scale than usual. Restricting our view to the single issue 
coming up next, here's what it looks like now: 

The lead is by C. C. MacApp, a writer who hitherto has appeared in 
Galaxy only as the author of a couple of biting and sardonically funny 
short stories like And All the Earth a Grave and A Flask of Fine Arcturan. 
Next month's is quite different. It's an adventure story. The place is the 
planet Mercury. The time, some hundreds of years in the future; and the 
title is The Mercurymen. Pederson has done the cover for it; and if the 
object you see in the background looks to you like a covered wagon — if 
is! It has to be, in fact — for reasons you will discover when you read the 
story. 

Robert Silverberg will join us again next issue with a long novelette 
called The Warriors of Light. And we have a pointed and funny novelette 
by a new writer named Norman Kagan (you may remember that he was 
one of the "firsts" we print in every issue of our companion magazine, If, 
some time ago. His story then was called The Mathenauts, and it was im- 
mediately selected for "best of the year" honors). What Kagan is writing 
about this time is politics — the grandest game of them all, as they say; 
but in Kagan's story the rules are those invented by Franz Kafka, and nat- 
urally enough the story is called Laugh Along with Franz. 

We also have a couple of shorts of special interest, since both mark 
the first and long overdue appearance of their authors in Galaxy. One is 
a very short one by Arthur C. Clarke (but he calls it the longest story ever 
written, for reasons you will see when you read it); the other is by Harlan 
Ellison. If they fit they'll be in!

Shall We Have 
a Little Talk? 

by ROBERT SHECKLEY 

Illustrated by GAUGHAN 



Earth didn't just walk in and conquer 
planets — there were definite rules! 
Why wouldn't these people cooperate? 



I 

'"T^he landing was a piece of cake 
despite gravitational vaga- 
ries produced by two suns and 
six moons. Low-level cloud cover 
could have given him some 
trouble if Jackson had been com- 
ing in visually. But he considered 
that to be kid stuff. It was better 
and safer to plug in the computer 
and lean back and enjoy the 
ride. 



The cloud cover broke up at 
2000 feet. Jackson was able to 
confirm his earlier sighting : there 
was a city down there, just as 
sure as sure. 

He was in one of the world’s 
loneliest jobs; but his line of 
work, paradoxically enough, re- 
quired an extremely gregarious 
man. Because of this built-in con- 
tradiction, Jackson was in the 
habit of talking to himself. Most 
of the men in his line of work 



172 



did. Jackson would talk to any- 
one, human or alien, no matter 
what their size or shape or color. 

It was what he was paid to do, 
and what he had to do anyhow. 
He talked when he was alone on 
the long interstellar runs, and he 
talked even more when he was 
with someone or something that 
would talk back. He figured he 
was lucky to be paid for his com- 
pulsions. 

“And not just paid, either,” he 
reminded himself. “Well paid, 
and with a bonus arrangement on 
top of that. And furthermore, 
this feels like my lucky planet. 
I feel like I could get rich on this 
one; unless they kill me down 
there, of course.” 

The lonely flights between the 
planets and the imminence of 
death were the only disadvan- 
tages of this job; but if the work 
weren’t hazardous and difficult, 
the pay wouldn’t be so good. 

Would they kill him? You 
could never tell. Alien life-forms 
were unpredictable — just like 
humans, only more so. 

“But I don’t think they’ll kill 
me,” Jackson said. “I just feel 
downright lucky today.” 

This simple philosophy had 
sustained him for years, across 
the endless lonely miles of space, 
and in and out of ten, twelve, 
twenty planets. He saw no reason 
to change his outlook now. 

The ship landed. Jackson 

SHALL WE HAVE A LITTLE TALK 



switched the status controls to 
standby. 

He checked the analyzer for 
oxygen and trace-element con- 
tent in the atmosphere, and took 
a quick survey of the local micro- 
organisms. The place was viable. 
He leaned back in his chair and 
waited. It didn’t take long, of 
course. They — the locals, in- 
digenes, authochtones, whatever 
you wanted to call them — came 
out of their city to look at the 
spaceship. And Jackson looked 
through the port at them. 

“Well now,” he said. “Seems 
like the alien life-forms in this 
neck of the woods are honest-to- 
Joe humanoids. That means a 
five thousand dollar bonus for old 
Uncle Jackson.” 

''X^he inhabitants of the city 
were bipedal monocepha- 
loids. They had the appropriate 
number of fingers, noses, eyes, 
ears and mouths. Their skin was 
a flesh-colored beige, their lips 
were a faded red, their hair was 
black, brown or red. 

“Shucks, they’re just like 
home-folks!” Jackson said. “Hell, 
I ought to get an extra bonus for 
that. Humanoidissmus, eh?” 

The aliens wore clothes. Some 
of them carried elaborately 
carved lengths of wood like 
swagger-sticks. The women deco- 
rated themselves with carved 
and enameled ornaments. At a 

173 



flying guess. Jackson ranked 
them about equivalent to Late 
Bronze Age on Earth. 

They talked and gestured 
among themselves. Their lan- 
guage was, of course, incompre- 
hensible to Jackson; but that 
didn’t matter. The important 
thing was that they had a lan- 
guage, and that their speech 
sounds could be produced by his 
vocal apparatus. 

“Not like on that heavy planet 
last year.’’ Jackson said. “Those 
supersonic sons of bitches! I had 
to wear special earphones and 
mike, and it was 110 in the 
shade.” 

The aliens were waiting for 
him, and Jackson knew it. That 
first moment of actual contact — 
it always was a nervous business. 

That’s when they were most 
apt to let you have it. 

Reluctantly he moved to the 
hatch, undogged, it, rubbed his 
eyes and cleared his throat. He 
managed to produce a smile. He 
told himself, “Don’t get sweaty, 
member, you’re just a little old 
Jackson, don’t choke up. Re- 
member you’re just a little old 
interstellar wanderer — kind of 
galactic vagabond — to extend 
the hand of friendship and all 
that jazz. You’ve just dropped in 
for a little talk, nothing more. 
Keep on believing that, sweety, 
and the extraterrestrial Johns will 
believe right along with you. Re- 



member Jackson’s Law: All in- 
telligent life-forms share the di- 
vine faculty of gulli'Diiity; which 
means that the triple-tongued 
Thung of Orangus V can be 
conned out of his skin just as 
easily as Joe Doakes of St. Paul.” 

And so, wearing a brave, arti- 
ficial little smile, Jackson swung 
the port open and stepped out 
to have a little talk. 

tW'oll now, how jhall?” Jack- 
^ son asl.ed at once, just to 
hear the sound of his own voice. 

The nearest aliens shrank away 
from him. Nearly all of them were 
frowning. Several of the younger 
ones carried bronze knives in a 
forearm scabbard. These were 
clumsy weapons, but as effective 
as anything ever invented. The 
aliens started to draw. 

“Now take it easy,” Jackson 
said, keeping his voice light and 
unalarmed. 

They drew their knives and 
began to edge forward. Jackson 
stood his ground, waiting, ready 
to bolt through the hatch like a 
jet-propelled jack-rabbit, hoping 
he could make it. 

Then a third man (might as 
well call them men Jackson de- 
cided) stepped in front of the 
belligerent two. This one was 
older. He spoke rapidly. He ges- 
tured. The two with the knives 
looked.

GALAXY 



“That’s right,” Jackson said 
encouragingly. “Take a good look. 
Heap big spaceship. Plenty strong 
medicine. Vehicle of great power, 
fabricated by a real advanced 
technology. Sort of makes you 
stop and think, doesn’t it?” 

It did. 

The aliens had stopped; 
and if not thinking, they were at 
least doing a great deal of talk- 
ing. They pointed at the ship, 
then back at their city. 

“You’re getting the idea,” 
Jackson told them. “Power 
speaks a universal language, eh, 
cousins?” 

He had been witness to many 
of these scenes on many different 
planets. He could nearly write 
their dialogue for them. It usu- 
ally went like this: 

Intruder lands in outlandish 
space vehicle, thereby eliciting 
(1) curiosity, (2) fear and (3) 
hostility. After some minutes of 
awed contemplation, one autoch- 
thone usually said to his friend: 
“Hey, that damned metal thing 
packs one hell of a lot of power.” 

“You’re right, Herbie,” his 
friend Fred, the second autoch- 
tiion, would reply. 

“You bet I’m right,” Herbie 
would say. “And hell, with that 
much power and technology and 
stuff, this son of a gun could like 
enslave us: I mean he really 
could.” 

“You’ve hit it, Herbie, that’s 
SHALL WE HAVE A LITTLE TALK 



just exactly what could happen.” 
“So what I say,” Herbie would 
continue, “I say, let’s not take 
any risks. I mean, sure, he looks 
friendly enough, but he’s just got 
too damned much power, and 
that’s not right. And right now is 
the best chance we’ll ever get to 
take him on account of he’s just 
standing there waiting for like an 
ovation or something. So let’s 
put this bastard out of his misery, 
and then we can talk the whole 
thing over, and see how it stacks 
up situationwise.” 

“By Jesus, I’m with you!” 
cries Fred. Others signify their 
assent. 

“Good for you, lads,” cries 
Herbie. “Let’s wade in and take 
this alien joker like now!" 

So they start to make their 
move; but suddenly, at the last 
second. Old Doc (the third 
autochthon) intervenes, saying, 
“Hold it a minute, boys, we can't 
do it like that. For one thing, 
we got laws around here — ” 

“To hell with that,” says P'red 
(a born troublemaker and some- 
what simple to boot). 

“ — and aside from the laws, 
it would be just too damned 
dangerous for us.” 

“Me’n Fred here ain’t scared,” 
says valiant Herb. “Maybe you 
better go take in a movie or 
something, Doc. Us guys’ll handle 
this.” 

“I was not referring to a short- 

175 



range personal danger,” Old Doc 
says scornfully. “What I fear is 
the destruction of our city, the 
slaughter of our loved ones and 
the annhilation of our culture.” 
Herb and Fred stop. “What 
you talking about, Doc? He’s just 
one stinking alien; you push a 
knife in his guts, he’ll bleed like 
anyone else.” 

“Fools! Schlemiels!” thunders 
the wise old Doc. “Of course you 
can kill him! But what happens 
after that?” 

“Huh?” says Fred, squinting 
his china-blue pop eyes. 

“Idiots! Cochons! You think 
this is the only spaceship these 
aliens got? You think they don’t 
even know whereabouts this guy 
has gone? Man, you gotta assume 
they got plenty more ships where 
this one came from, and you got- 
ta also assume that they’ll be 
damned mad if this ship doesn’t 
show up when it’s supposed to, 
and you gotta assume that when 
these aliens learn the score they’re 
gonna be damned sore and buzz 
back here and stomp on every- 
thing and everybody.” 

“How come I gotta assume 
that? asks feeble-witted Fred. 

“Cause it’s what you’d do in a 
deal like that, right?” 

“I guess maybe I would at 
that,” says Fred, with a sheep- 
ish grin. “Yeah, I just might do 
that little thing. But look, may- 
be they wouldn’t. 

176 



“Maybe, maybe,” mimics wise 
old Doc. “Well, baby, v-je can’t 
risk the whole ball game on a 
goddamned maybe. We can’t af- 
ford to kill this alien joker 
or the chance that maybe his 
people wouldn’t do what any 
reasonable-minded guy would do, 
which is namely to blow us all 
to hell.” 

“Well, I suppose we maybe 
can’t,” Herbie says. “But Doc, 
what can we do?” 

“Just wait and see what he 
wants . 

II 

A scene very much like that, 
according to reliable recon- 
struction, had been enacted at 
least thirty or forty times. It 
usually resulted in a policy of 
wait-and-see. Occasionally the 
contactor from Elarth was killed 
before wise counsel could prevail; 
but Jackson was paid to take 
risks like that. 

Whenever the contactor was 
killed, retribution followed with 
swift and terrible inevitability. 
Also with regret, of course, be- 
cause Earth was an extremely 
civilized place and accustomed to 
living within the law. No civiliz- 
ed law-abiding race likes to 
commit genocide. In fact, the 
folks on Earth consider genocide 
a very unpleasant matter, and 
they don’t like to read about it 

GALAXY 



or anything like it in their morn- 
ing papers. Envoys must be pro- 
tected, of course, and murder 
must be punished ; everybody 
knows that. But it still doesn’t 
feel nice to read about a geno- 
cide over your morning coffee. 
News like that can spoil a man’s 
entire day. Three or four geno- 
cides and a man just might get 
angry enough to switch his vote. 

Fortunately, there was never 
much occasion for that sort of 
mess. Aliens usually caught on 
pretty fast. Despite the language 
barrier, aliens learned that you 
simply don’t kill Earthmen. 

And then, later, bit by bit, they 
learned all the rest. 

^"T^he hot-heads had sheathed 
their knives. Everybody was 
smiling except Jackson, who was 
grinning like a hyena. The aliens 
were making graceful arm-and- 
leg motions, probably of wel- 
come. 

“Well, that’s real nice,” Jack- 
son said, making a few graceful 
gestures of his own. “Makes me 
feel real to-home. And now, sup- 
pose you take me to your leader, 
show me the town and all that 
jazz. Then I’ll set myself down 
and figure out that lingo of yours, 
and we’ll have a little talk. And 
after that, everything will proceed 
splendidly. En avanti” 

So saying, Jackson stepped out 
at a brisk pace in the direction 
SHALL WE HAVE A LIHLE TALK 



of the city. After a brief hesita- 
tion, his new-found friends fell 
into step behind him. 

Everything was moving accord- 
ing to plan. 

Jackson, like all the other Con- 
tactors, was a polyglot of singu- 
lar capabilities. As basic equip- 
ment, he had an eidetic memory 
and an extremely discriminating 
ear. More important, he possess- 
ed a startling aptitude for langu- 
age and an uncanny intuition for 
meaning. When Jackson came up 
against an incomprehensible ton- 
gue, he picked out, quickly and 
unerringly, the significant units, 
the fundamental building blocks 
of the language. Quite without 
effort he sorted vocalizations in- 
to cognitive, volitional and emo- 
tional aspects of speech. Gram- 
matical elements presented them- 
selves at once to his practiced ear. 
Affixes and suffixes were no 
trouble: word sequence, pitch and 
reduplication were no sweat. He 
didn’t know much about the 
science of linguistics, but he didn’t 
need to know. Jackson was a nat- 
ural. Linguistics had been devel- 
oped to describe and explain 
things which he knew intuitively. 

He had not yet encountered 
the language which he could not 
learn. He never really expected 
to find one. As he often told his 
friends in the Forked Totigue 
Club in New York, “Waal, shu- 
kins, there just really ain’t nuthin 

177 



tough about them alien tongues. 
Leastwise, not the ones I’ve run 
across. I mean that sincerely. I 
mean to tell you, boys, that the 
man who can express hisself in 
Sioux or Khmer ain’t going to 
encounter too much trouble out 
there amongst the stars.” 

And so it had been, to date . 

Once in the city, there were 
many tedious ceremonies which 
Jackson had to endure. They 
stretched on for three days — 
about par for the course. He 
knew the reason for them, of 
course; it wasn’t every day that a 
traveller from Space came in for 
a visit. So naturally enough every 
mayor, governor, president and 
alderman, and their wives, wanted 
to shake his hand. It was all very 
understandable, but Jackson re- 
sented the waste of his time. He 
had work to do, some of it not 
very pleasant, and the sooner 
he got started the quicker it 
would be over. 

On the fourth day he was able 
to reduce the official nonsense to 
a minimum. That was the day 
in which he began in earnest to 
learn the local language. 

A language, as any linguist will 
tell you, is undoubtedly the 
most beautiful creation one is 
ever likely to encounter. But 
with that beauty goes a certain 
element of danger. 

Language might aptly be com- 
178 



pared to the sparkling, ever- 
changing face of the sea. Like 
the sea, you never know what 
reefs may be concealed in its 
pellucid depths. The brightest 
water hides the most treacherous 
shoals. 

Jackson, well-prepared for 
trouble, encountered none at first. 
The main language (Hon) of this 
planet (Na), was spoken by the 
overwhelming majority of its in- 
habitants (En-a-To-Na — liter- 
ally, men of the Na, or Naians, 
as Jackson preferred of think of 
them). Hon seemed quite a 
straightforward affair. It used 
one term for one concept, and 
allowed no fusions, juxtapositions 
or agglutinations. Concepts were 
built up by sequences of simple 
words (‘spaceship’ was ho-pa- 
aie-an — boat-flying-outer-sky). 
Thus, Hon was very much like 
Chinese and Annamite on Earth. 
Pitch differences were employed 
not only intentionally to differ- 
entiate between homonyns, but 
also positionally, to denote grad- 
ations of ‘perceived realism,’ 
bodily discomfort and three class- 
es of pleasurable expectation. All 
of which was mildly interesting 
but of no particular difficulty to 
a competent linguist. 

To be sure, a language like 
Hon was rather a bore because of 
the long word-lists one had to 
memorize. But pitch and position 
could be fun, as well as being ab- 

GALAXY 



solutely essential if one wanted 
to make any sense out of the 
sentence-units. So, taken all in 
all, Jackson was not dissatisfied, 
and he absorbed the language as 
quickly as it could be given to 
him. 

It was a proud day for Jack- 
son, about a week later, when he 
could say to his tutor: “A very 
nice and pleasant good morning 
to you, most estimable and hon- 
ored tutor, and how is your bless- 
ed health upon this glorious 
day?’ 

“Felicitations most ird wunk!” 
the tutor replied with a smile of 
deep warmth. “Your accent, dear 
pupil, is superb ! Positively gor 
nak, in fact, and your grasp of my 
dear mother tongue is little short 
of ur nak tai.” 

Jackson glowed all over from 
the gentle old tutor’s compli- 
ments. He felt quite pleased with 
himself. Of course, he hadn’t 
recognized several words; ird 
wunk and ur nak tai sounded 
faintly familiar, but gor nak was 
completely unknown. Still lapses 
were expected of a beginner in 
any language. He did know 
enough to understand the Naians, 
and to make himself understood 
by them. And that was what his 
job required. 

He returned to his spaceship 
that afternoon. The hatch had 
been standing open during his 
entire stay on Na but he found 

SHALL WE HAVE A LITTLE TALK 




179 



that not a single article had been 
stolen. He shook his nead rue- 
fully at this, but refused to let it 
upset him. He loaded his pockets 
with a variety of objects and 
sauntered back to the city. He 
was ready to perform the tinal 
and most important part of his 
job. 

HI 

n the heart of the business dis- 
trict, at the intersection of Um 
and Alhretto, he found what he 
was looking for; a real estate of- 
fice. He entered, and was taken 
to the office of Mr. Erum, a jun- 
ior partner of the firm. 

“Well, well, well, well!” Erum 
said, shaking hands heartily. 
“This is a real honor, sir, a very 
considerable and genuine privi- 
lege. Are you thinking of acquir- 
ing a piece of property?” 

“That was my intention,” 
Jackson said. “Unless, of course, 
you have discriminatory laws 
that forbid your selling to a fore- 
igner.” 

“No difficulty there,” Erum 
said. “In fact, it’ll be a veritable 
orai of a pleasure to have a man 
from your distant and glorious 
civilization in our midst.” 

Jackson restrained a snicker. 
“The only other difficulty I can 
imagine is the question of legal 
tender. I don’t have any of your 
currency, of course; but I have 
180 



certain quantities of gold, plati- 
num, diamonds and other objects 
which are considered valuable on 
Earth.” 

“They are considered valuable 
here, too,” Erum said. “Quanti- 
ties, did you say? My dear sir, we 
will have no difficulties; not even 
a blaggle shall mit or ows, as the 
poet said.” 

“Quite so,” Jackson replied. 
Erum was using some words he 
didn’t know, but that didn’t mat- 
ter. The main drift was clear 
enough. “Now, suppose we begin 
with a nice industrial site. After 
all, I’ll have to do something with 
my time. And after that we can 
pick out a house.” 

“Most decidedly prominex,” 
Erum said gaily. “Suppose I just 
raish through my listings here 
. Yes, what do you say to a 
bromicaine factory? It’s in a first- 
class condition, and could easily 
be converted to vor manufacture, 
or used as it is.” 

“Is there any real market for 
bromicaine?” Jackson asked. 

“Well, bless my muergentan, 
of course there is! Bromicaine is 
indispensable, though its sales are 
seasonable. You see, refined 
bromicaine, or ariisi, is used by 
the protigash devolvers, who of 
course harvest by the solstice- 
season, except in those branches 
of the industry that have switch- 
ed over to ticothene revature. 
Those from a steadily — ”’ 



GALAXY 



“Fine, fine,” Jackson said. He 
didn’t care what a bromicaine 
was, and never expected to see 
one. As long as it was a gainful 
employment of some kind it fill- 
ed his specifications. 

“I’ll buy it,” he said. 

“You won’t regret it,” Erum 
told him. “A good bromicaine 
factory is a garveldis hagatis, and 
menifoy as well.” 

“Sure,” Jackson said, wishing 
that he had a more extensive 
Hon vocabulary. “How much?” 
“Well, sir, the price is no dif- 
ficulty. But first you’ll have to 
fill out the ollanbrit form. It is 
just a few sken questions which 
ny naga of everyone.” 

E rum handed Jackson the form. 

The first question read: 
“Have you, now or at any past 
time, elikated mushkies forsical- 
ly? State date of all occurrences. 
If no occurrences, state the rea- 
son for transgrishal reduct as 
found.” 

Jackson read no farther. “What 
does it mean,” he asked Erum, 
“to elikate mushkies forsically?” 
“Mean?” Erum smiled uncer- 
tainly. “Why, it means exactly 
what it says. Or so I would im- 
agine.” 

“I meant,” Jackson said, “that 
I do not understand the words. 
Could you explain them to me?” 
“Nothing simpler,” Erum re- 
plied. “To elikate mushkies is 
SHALL WE HAVE A LITTLE TALK 



almost the same as a bifur pro- 
bishkai.” 

“I beg your pardon?” Jackson 
said. 

“It means — well, to elikate 
is really rather simple, though 
perhaps not in the eyes of the 
law. Scorbadising is a form of 
elikation, and so is manruv gar- 
ing. Some say that when V7e 
breathe drorsically in the evening 
subsis we are actually elikating. 
Personally, I consider that a bit 
fanciful.” 

“Let’s try mushkies,” Jackson 
suggested. 

“By all means, let’s!” Erum re- 
plied, with a coarse boom of 
laughter. “If only one could — 
eh?” He dug Jackson in the ribs 
with a sly elbow. 

“Hm, yes,” Jackson replied 
coldly. “Perhaps you could tell 
me what, exactly, a mushkie is?” 

“Of course. As it happens, 
there is no such thing,” Erum 
replied. “Not in the singular, at 
any rate. One mushkie would be 
a logical fallacy, don’t you see?” 

“I’ll take your word for it. 
What are mushkies?” 

“Well, primarily, they’re the 
object of elikation. Secondarily, 
they are halfsize wooden sandals 
which are used to stimulate ero- 
tic fantasies among the Kutor 
religionists.” 

“Now we’re getting some- 
place!” Jackson cried. 

“Only if your tastes happen to 

181 



run that way,” Erum answered 
with discernable coldness. 

“I meant in terms of under- 
standing the question on the 
form — ” 

“Of course, excuse me,” Erum 
said. “But you see, the question 
asks if you have ever elikated 
mush kies forsically. And that 
makes all the difference.” 

“Does it really?” 

“Of course! The modification 
changes the entire meaning.” 

“I was afraid that it would,” 
Jackson said. “I don’t suppose 
you could explain what forsically 
means?” 

“I certainly can!” Erum said. 
“Our conversation now could — 
with a slight assist from the 
deme imagination — be termed 
a forsically designed talk." 

“Ah,” said Jackson. 

“Quite so,” said Erum. “For- 
sically is a mode, a manner It 
means ‘spiritually-forward-lead- 
ing - by - way - of - fortuitous 
- frieindship.’ ” 

“That’s a little more like it,” 
Jackson said. “In that case, when 
one elikates mushkies forsical- 
ly — ” 

• 

ttT’m terribly afraid you’re on 
Ji- the wrong track,” Erum 
said. “The definition I gave you 
applies only to conversations. It 
is something rather different 
when one speaks of mushkies.” 
“What does it mean then?” 

182 



“Well, it means — or rather it 
expresses — an advanced and 
intensified case of mushkie eliki- 
dation, but with a definite nmog- 
metic bias. I consider it a rather 
unfortunate phraseology, person- 
ally.” 

“How would you put it?” 

“I’d lay it on the line and to 
hell with the fancy talk,” Erum 
said toughly. “I’d come right 
out and say: ‘Have you now or 
at any other time dunfiglers voc 
in illegal, immoral, or insirtis 
circumstances, with or without 
the aid and/or consent of a 
brachniian? If so, state when and 
why. If not, state neugris kris and 
why not.’ ” 

“That’s how you’d put it, huh ?” 
Jackson said. 

“Sure I would,” Erum said di- 
fiantly. “These forms are for 
adults, aren’t they? So why not 
come right out and call a spigler 
a spigler a spey? Everybody dun- 
figlers voc some of the time, and 
so what? No one’s feelings are 
ever hurt by it, for heaven’s sake. 
I mean, after all, it simply in- 
volves oneself and a twisted old 
piece of wood, so why should 
anyone care?” 

“Wood?” Jackson echoed. 

“Yes, wood. A commonplace, 
dirty old piece of wood. Or at 
least that’s all it would be if 
people didn’t get their feelings 
so ridiculously involved.” 

“What do they do with the 
GALAXY 



wood?” Jackson asked quickly. 

“Do with it? Nothing much, 
when you come right down to it. 
But the religious aura is simply 
too much for our so-called in- 
tellectuals. They are unable, in 
my opinion, to isolate the simple 
primordial fact — wood — from 
the cultural volturneiss which 
surrounds it at festerhius, and to 
some extent at Uuis, too.” 

“That’s how intellectuals are,” 
Jackson said. “But you can iso- 
late it, and you find — ” 

“I find it’s really nothing to 
get excited about. I really mean 
that. I mean to say that a cath- 
edral, viewed correctly, is no 
more than a pile of rocks, and a 
forest is just an assembly of 
atoms. Why should we see this 
case differently? I mean, really, 
you could elikate mushkies forsi- 
cally without even using woodl 
What do you think of that?” 
“I’m impressed,” Jackson said. 
“Don’t get me wrong! I’m not 
saying it would be easy, or natur- 
al, or even right. But still, you 
damned well could! Why, you 
could substitute cormed grayti 
and still come out all right!” 
Erum paused and chuckled. 
“You’d look foolish, but you’d 
still come out all right.” 

“Very interesting,” Jackson 
said. 

“I’m afraid I became a bit 
vehement,” Erum said, wiping his 
forehead. “Was I talking very 
SHALL WE HAVE A LIHLE TALK 



loudly? Do you think perhaps I 
was overheard?” 

“Of course not. I found it all 
very interesting. I must leave 
just now, Mr. Erum, but I’ll be 
back tomorrow to fill out that 
form and buy the property.” 
“I’ll hold it for you,” Erum 
said, rising and shaking Jackson’s 
hand warmly. “And I want to 
thank you. It isn’t often that I 
have the opportunity for this 
kind of frank, no-holds-barred 
conversation.” 

“I found it very instructive,” 
Jackson said. He left Emm’s 
office and walked slowly back 
to his ship. He was disturbed, 
upset and annoyed. Linguistic in- 
comprehension irked him, no 
matter how comprehensible it 
might be. He should have been 
able to have figured out, some- 
how, how one went about elikat- 
ing mushkies forsically. 

Never mind, he told himself. 
You’ll work it out tonight. Jack- 
son baby, and then you’ll go 
back in there and cannonball 
through them forms. So don’t 
get het up over it, man. 

He’d work it out. He damned 
well had to work it out, since he 
had to own a piece of property. 

That was the second part of 
his job. 

E arth had come a long way 
since the bad old days of 
naked, aggressive warfare. Ac- 

183 



cording to the history books, a 
ruler back in those ancient times 
could simply send out his troops 
to seize whatever the ruler want- 
ed. And if any of the folks at 
home had the temerity to ask 
why he wanted it, the ruler 
could have them beheaded, or 
locked up in a dungeon, or sewn 
up in a sack and thrown into the 
sea. And he wouldn’t even feel 
guilty about doing any of those 
things because he invariably be- 
lieved that he was right and they 
were wrong. 

This policy, technically called 
the droit de signeur, was one of 
the most remarkable features of 
the laissez fake capitalism which 
the ancients knew. 

But, down the slow passage of 
centuries, cultural processes were 
inexorably at work. A new ethic 
came into the world; and slowly 
but surely, a sense of fair play 
and justices was bred into the 
human race. Rulers came to be 
chosen by ballot, and were re- 
sponsive to the desires of the elec- 
torate. Conceptions of Justices, 
Mercy and Pity came to the 
forefront of men’s minds, ameli- 
orating the old law of tooth and 
talon, and amending the savage 
bestiality of the ancient time of 
unreconstruction. 

The old days were gone for- 
ever. Today, no ruler could simp- 
ly take; the voters would never 
stand for it. 

184 



Nowadays one had to have an 
excuse for taking. 

Like for example a Terran citi- 
zen who happened to own pro- 
perty all legal and aboveboard 
on an alien planet, and who urg- 
ently needed and requested Ter- 
ran military assistance in order 
to protect himself, his home, his 
means of a legitimate liveli- 
hood . 

But first he had to own that 
property. He had to really own 
it, to protect himself from the 
bleeding-hearts Congressmen and 
the soft-on-aliens newsmen who 
always started an investigation 
whenever Earth took charge of 
another planet. 

To provide a legal basis for 
conquest — that was what the 
Contactors were for. 

“Jackson,” Jackson said to 
himself, “you gonna sit your- 
self that li'l ole bromicaine fac- 
tory tomorrow and you gonna 
own it without let or hindrance. 
You heah me, boy? I mean it 
sincerely.” 

On the morrow, shortly before 
noon, Jackson was back in the 
city. Several hours of intensive 
study, and a long consultation 
with this tutor, had sufficed to 
show him where he had gone 
wrong. 

It was simple enough. He had 
merely been a trifle hasty in 
assuming an extreme and invari- 
ant isolating technique in the 

GALAXY 



IV 



Hon use of radicals. He had 
thought, on the basis of his early 
studies, that word-meaning and 
word-order were the only signifi- 
cant factors required for an un- 
derstanding of the language. But 
that wasn’t so. Upon further ex- 
amination, Jackson found that 
the Hon language had some unex- 
pected recourses; affixation, for 
example, and an elementary form 
of reduplication. Yesterday he 
hadn’t even been prepared for 
any morphological inconsisten- 
cies; when they had occurred, he 
had found himself in semantic 
difficulties. 

The new forms were easy 
enough to learn. The trouble was, 
they were thoroughly illogical 
and contrary to the entire spirit 

of Hon. 

One word produced by one 
sound, and bearing one meaning 

— that was the rule he had pre- 
viously deduced. But now he dis- 
covered 18 important exceptions 

— compounds produced by a va- 
riety of techniques, each of them 
with a list of modifying suffixes. 
For Jackson, this was as odd as 
stumbling across a grove of palm 
trees in Antarctica. 

He learned the 18 exceptions, 
and thought about the article he 
would write when he finally got 
home. 

And the next day, wiser and 
warier, Jackson strode meaning- 
fully back to the city. 

SHALL WE HAVE A LIHLE TALK? 



I n Emm’s office, he filled out 
the government forms with 
ease. That first question — ■ 
“Have you now or at any past 
time, elikated mushkies forsical- 
ly?” — he could now answer with 
an honest no. The plural ‘mush- 
kies’ in its primary meaning, rep- 
resented in this context, the sin- 
gular ‘woman.’ (The singular 
‘mushkie’ used similarly, would 
denote an uncorporeal state of 
femininity.) 

Elikation was, of course, the 
role of sexual termination, unless 
one employed the modifier ‘forsi- 
cally.’ If one did, this quiet term 
took on a charged meaning in this 
particular context, tantamount 
to edematous polysexual advoca- 
tion. 

Thus, Jackson could honestly 
write that, since he was not a 
Naian, he had never had that par- 
ticular urge. 

It was as simple as that. Jack- 
son was annoyed at himself for 
not having figured it out on his 
own. 

He filled in the rest of the 
questions without difficulty, and 
handed the paper back to Emm. 

“That’s really quite skoe,’’ 
Erum said. “Now, there are just 
a few more simple items for us 
to complete. The first we can 
do immediately. After that I will 
arrange a brief official ceremony 

185 



for the Property Transferral Act, 
and ttiat will be followed by 
several other small bits of busi- 
ness. All of it should take no 
more than a day or so, and then 
the property will be all yours.” 

“Sure, kid, that’s great,” Jack- 
son said. He wasn’t bothered by 
the delays. Quite the contrary, 
he had expected many more of 
them. On most other planets, the 
locals caught on quickly to what 
was happening. It took no great 
reasoning power to figure out that 
Earth wanted what she wanted, 
but wanted it in a legalistic man- 
ner. 

As for why she wanted it that 
way — that wasn’t too hard to 
fathom, either. A great majority 
of T errans were idealist, and they 
believed fervently in concepts 
such as truth, justice, mercy and 
the like. And not only did they 
believe, they also let those noble 
concepts guide their actions — 
except when it would be incon- 
venient or unprofitable. When 
that happened, they acted ex- 
pediently, but continued to talk 
moralistically. This meant that 
they were hypocrites — a term 
which every race has its counter- 
part of. 

Terrans wanted what they 
wanted, but they also wanted 
that what they wanted should 
look nice. This was a lot to ex- 
pect sometimes, especially when 
what they wanted was ownership 
186 



of someone else’s planet. But in 
one way or another, they usually 
got it. 

Most alien races realized that 
overt resistance was impossible, 
and resorted to various stalling 
tactics. 

Sometimes they refused to 
sell, or they required an in- 
finite multiplicity of forms, or 
the approval of some local offici- 
al who was always absent. But for 
each ploy the Contactor always 
had a suitable counter-ploy. 

Did they refuse to sell proper- 
ty on racial grounds? The laws of 
Earth specifically forbade such 
practices, and the Declaration of 
Sentient Rights stated the free- 
dom of all sentients to live and 
work wherever they pleased. This 
was a freedom that Terra would 
fight for, if anyone forced them 
to. 

Were they stalling? The Terran 
Doctrine of Temporal Propriety 
would not allow it. 

Was the necessary official ab- 
sent? The Uniform Earth Code 
Against Implicit Sequestration in 
Acts of Omission expressly for- 
bade such a practice . And so 
on and so on. It was a game of 
wits Earth invariably won, since 
the strongest is usually judged 
the cleverest. 

But the Naians weren’t even 
trying to fight back. Jackson con- 
sidered that downright despic- 
able. 



GALAXY 




'"T^he exchange of Naian cur- 
rency for Terran platinum 
was completed and Jackson was 
given his change in crisp 50-Vrso 
bills. Erum beamed with pleasure, 
and said, “Now, Mr. Jackson, we 
can complete today’s business if 
you will kindly trombramcthulan- 
chierir in the usual manner.” 
Jackson turned, his eyes nar- 
rowed and his mouth compressed 
into a bloodless downward-curv- 
ing line. 

“What did you say?” 

“I merely asked you to — ” 

“I know what you asked! But 
what does it mean?” 

“Well, it means — it means — ” 
Erum laughed weakly. “ — it 
means exactly what it says. That 
SHALL WE HAVE A LITTLE TALK? 



is to say — ethybolically speak- 
ing — ” 

Jackson said in a low, danger- 
ous voice, “Give me a synonym.” 

“There is no synonym,” Erum 
said. 

“Baby, you better come up 
with one anyhow,” Jackson said, 
his hand closing over Erum’s 
throat. 

“Stop! Wait! Ulp!” Erum cried. 
“Mr. Jackson, I beg of you! How 
can there be a synonym when 
there is one and only one term 
for the thing expressed — if I 
may so express it?” 

“You’re putting me on!” Jack- 
son howled. “And you better quit 
it, on account of we got laws 
against willful obfuscation, inten- 

137 



tional obstructionism, implicit 
superimposition and other stuff 
like you’re doing. You hear me?” 
“I hear you,” Erum trembled. 
“Then hear this: stop agglut- 
inating, you devious dog! You’ve 
got a perfectly ordinary run-of- 
the-mill analytical-type langu- 
age, distinguished only by its ex- 
treme isolating tendency. And 
when you got a language like 
that, man, then you simply don’t 
agglutinate a lot of big messy 
compounds. Get me?” 

“Yes, yes,” Erum cried. “But 
believe me, I don’t intend to 
numniscaterate in the slightest! 
Not noniskakkekaki, and you 
really must debruchili that!” 
Jackson drew back his fist, but 
got himself under control in time. 
It was unwise to hit aliens if 
there was any possibility that 
they were telling the truth. Folks 
on Terra didn’t like it. His pay 
could be docked; and if, by some 
unlucky chance, he killed Erum, 
he could be slapped with a six 
month jail sentence. 

But still . 

• “I’ll find out if you’re lying 
or not!” Jackson screamed, and 
stormed out of the office. 

T Te walked for nearly an hour, 
mingling with the crowds in 
the slum quarters of Grath-Eth, 
below the gray, evil-smelling Un- 
gperdis. No one paid any atten- 
tion to him. To all outward ap- 



pearances, he could have been a 
Naian, just as any Naian could 
have been a Terran. 

Jackson located a cheerful sa- 
loon on the corner of Niis and 
Da Streets, and went in. 

It was quiet and masculine in- 
side. Jackson ordered a local 
variety of beer. When it was 
served, he said to the bartender, 
“Funny thing happened to me 
the other day.” 

“Yeah?” said the bartender. 

“Yeah, really,” Jackson said. 
“I had this big business deal on, 
see, and then at the last minute 
they asked me to trombramcthu- 
lanchierir in the usual manner.” 

He watched the bartender’s 
face carefully. A faint expression 
of puzzlement crossed the man’s 
stolid features. 

“So why didn’t you?” the bar- 
tender asked. 

“You mean you would have?” 

“Sure I would have. Hell, it’s 
the standard cathanpriptiaia, 
ain’t it?” 

“Course it is,” one of the loung- 
ers at the bar said. “Unless, of 
course, you suspected they was 
trying to numniscaterate.” 

“No, I don’t think they were 
trying anything like that,” Jack- 
son said in a flat low, lifeless 
voice. He paid for his drink and 
started to leave. 

“Hey,” the bartender called af- 
ter him, “You sure they wasn’t 
noniskakkekaki ?” 



188 



GALAXY 



“You never know,” Jackson 
said, walking slump-shouldered 
into the street. 

Jackson trusted his instincts, 
both with languages and with 
people. His instincts told him now 
that the Naians were straight, 
and were not practicing an elabo- 
rate deception on him. Erum had 
not been inventing new words for 
the sake of willful confusion. He 
had been really speaking the Hon 
language as he knew it. 

But if that were true, then Na 
was a very strange language. In 
fact, it was down-right eccentric. 
And its implications were not 
merely curious. 

They were disastrous. 

V 

'T^hat evening Jackson went 
back to work. He discovered 
a further class of exceptions 
which he had not known or even 
suspected. That was a group of 
29 multi-valued potentiators. 
These words, meaningless in 
themselves, acted to elicit a com- 
plicated and discordant series of 
shadings from other words. Their 
particular type of potentiation 
varied according to their position 
in the sentence. 

Thus, when Emm had asked 
him “to trombramcthulanchierir 
in the usual manner,” he had 
merely wanted Jackson to make 
an obligatory ritual obeisance. 

SHALL WE HAVE A LITTLE TALK? 



This consisted of clasping his 
hands behind his neck and 
rocking back on his heels. 
He was required to perform 
this action with an expres- 
sion of definite yet modest pleas- 
ure, in accordance with the total- 
ity of the situation, and also in 
accord with the state of his sto- 
mach and nerves and with his re- 
ligion and ethical code, and bear- 
ing in mind minor temperamental 
differences due to fluctuations in 
heat and humidity, and not for- 
getting the virtues of patience, 
similitude and forgiveness. 

It v/as all quite understandable. 
And all completely contradictory 
to everything Jackson had pre- 
viously learned about Hon. 

It was more than contradic- 
tory; it was unthinkable, impos- 
sible, and entirely out of order. 
It was as if, having discovered 
palm trees in frigid Antarctica, 
he had further found that the 
fruit of tiiese trees was, not co- 
conuts, but muscatel grapes. 

It couldn’t be — but it was. 

Jackson did what was required 
of him. When he had finished 
trombramcthulanchierering in 
the usual manner, he had only to 
get through the official ceremony 
and the several small require- 
ments after it. 

Erum assured him that it was 
all quite simple, but Jackson sus- 
pected that he might some- 
how have difficulties. 



189 



So, in preparation, he put in 
three days of hard work acquir- 
ing a real mastery of the 29 ex- 
ceptional potentiators, together 
with their most common posi- 
tions, and their potentiating ef- 
fect in each of these positions. 
He finished, bone-weary and with 
his irritability index risen to 
97.3620 on the Grafheimer scale. 
An impartial observer might have 
noticed an ominous gleam in his 
china-blue eyes. 

Jackson had had it. He was 
sick of the Hon language and of 
all things Naian. He had the ver- 
tiginous feeling that the more 
he learned, the less he knew. It 
was downright perverse. 

“Hokay,” Jackson said, to him- 
self and to the universe at large. 
“I have learned the Naian lan- 
gauge, and I have learned a set 
of completely inexplicable excep- 
tions, and I have also learned a 
further and even more contradic- 
tory set of exceptions to the ex- 
ceptions.” 

Jackson paused, and in a very 
low voice said; “1 have learned 
an exceptional number of excep- 
tions. Indeed, an impartial ob- 
server might think that this lan- 
guage is composed of nothing 
but exceptions. 

“But that” he continued, “is 
damned well impossible, unthink- 
able and unacceptable. A lan- 
guage is by God and by defini- 
tion systematic, which means it’s 
19C 



gotta follow some kind of rules. 
Otherwise nobody can’t under- 
stand nobody. That’s the way it 
works and that’s the way it’s got- 
ta be. And if anyone thinks they 
can horse around linguisticwise 
with Fred C. Jackson — ” 

Here Jackson paused and drew 
the blaster from his holster. He 
checked the charge, snapped off 
the safety and replaced the wea- 
pon. 

“Just better no one give old 
Jackson no more doubletalking,” 
old Jackson muttered. “Because 
the next alien who tries it is go- 
ing to get a three-inch circle 
drilled through his lousy cheating 
guts.” 

So saying, Jackson marched 
back to the city. He was feeling 
decidedly light-headed, but ab- 
solutely determined. His job was 
to steal this planet out from un- 
der its inhabitants in a legal man- 
ner, and in order to do that he 
had to make sense out of their 
language. Therefore, in one way 
or another, he was going to make 
sense. Either that, or he was go- 
ing to make some corpses. 

At this point, he didn’t much 
care which. 

■prum was in his office, wait- 
ing for him. With him were 
the mayor, the President of the 
City Council, the Borough Presi- 
dent, two aldermen and the Di- 
rector of the Board of Estimates. 

GALAXY 



All of them were smiling — affab- 
ly, albeit nervously. Strong spir- 
its were present on a sideboard, 
and there was a subdued air of 
fellowship in the room. 

All in all, it looked as if Jack- 
son were being welcomed as a 
new and highly respected prop- 
erty owner, an adornment to 
Fakka. Aliens took it that way 
sometimes : made the best of a 
bad bargain by trying to ingrat- 
iate themselves with the Inevit- 
able Earthman. 

“Mun,” said Emm, shaking his 
hand enthusiastically. 

“Same to you, kid,” Jackson 
said. He had no idea what the 
word meant. Nor did, he care. He 
had plenty of other Naian words 
to choose among, and he had the 
determination to force matters 
to a conclusion. 

“Mun!” said the mayor. 

“Thanks, pop,” said Jackson. 

“Mun!” declared the other of- 
ficials. 

“Glad you boys feel that way,” 
said Jackson. He turned to Erum. 
“Well, let’s get it over with, 
okay?” 

“Mun-mun-mun,” Emm re- 
plied. “Mun, mun-mun.” 

Jackson stared at him for sev- 
eral seconds. Then he said, in a 
low, controlled voice, “Erum, 
baby, just exactly what are you 
trying to say to me?” 

“Mun, mun, mun,” Erum stat- 
ed firmly. “Mun, mun mun mun. 
SHALL WE HAVE A LITTLE TALK 



Mun mun.” He paused, and in a 
somewhat nervous voice asked 
the mayor: “Mun, mun?” 

“Mun . mun mun,” the 
mayor replied firmly, and the 
other officials nodded. They all 
turned to Jackson. 

“Mun, mun-mun?” Erum 
asked him, tremulously, but with 
dignity. 

Jackson was numbed speech- 
less. His face turned a choleric 
red and a large blue vein started 
to pulse in his neck. But he man- 
aged to speak slowly, calmly and 
with infinite menace. 

“Just what,” he said, “do you 
lousy third-rate yokels think 
you’re pulling?” 

“Mun-mun?” the mayor asked 
Erum. 

“Mun-mun, mun-mun-mun,” 
Erum replied quickly, making a 
gesture of incomprehension. 

“You better talk sense,” Jack- 
son said. His voice was still low, 
but the vein in his neck writhed 
like a firehose under pressure. 

“Mun!” one of the aldermen 
said quickly to the Borough 
President. 

“Mun mun-mun mun?” the 
Borough President answered pit- 
eously, his voice breaking on the 
last word. 

“So you won’t talk sense, 
huh?” 

“Mun! Mun-mun!” the mayor 
cried his face gone ashen with 
fright. 



191 



others looked, and saw 
Jackson’s right hand 
clearing the blaster and taking 
aim at Erum’s chest. 

“Quit horsing around!” Jack- 
spn commanded. The vein in his 
neck pulsed like a python in 
travail. 

“Mun - mun - mun!” Erum 
pleaded, dropping to his knees. 

“Mun-mun-mun!” the mayor 
shrieked, rolling his eyes and 
fainting. 

“You get it now,” Jackson said 
to Erum. His finger whitened on 
the trigger. 

Erum, his teeth chattering, 
managed to gasp out a strangled 
“Mun-mun, mun?” But then his 
nerves gave way and he waited 
for death with jaw agape and 
eyes unfocused. 

Jackson took up the last frac- 
tion of slack in the trigger. Then, 
abruptly, he let up and shoved 
the blaster back in its holster. 

“Mun, mun!” Erum managed 
to say. 

“Shaddap,” Jackson said. He 
Stepped back and glared at the 
cringing Naian officials. 

He would have dearly loved 
to blast them all. But he couldn’t 
do it. Jackson had to come to a 
belated acknowledgement of an 
unacceptable reality. 

His impeccable linguist’s ear 
had heard, and his polyglot brain 
had analyzed. Dismayingly he 
had realized that the Naians were 
192 



not trying to put anything over 
on him. They were speaking, not 
nonsense, but a true language. 

This language was made up at 
present of the single sound ‘mun.’ 
This sound could carry an exten- 
sive repei'toire of meanings 
through variations in pitch and 
pattern, changes in stress and 
quantity, alteration of rhythm 
and repetition, and through ac- 
companying gestures and facial 
expressions. 

A language consisting of infin- 
ite variations on a single word! 
Jackson didn’t want to believe it, 
but he was too good a linguist to 
doubt the evidence of his own 
trained senses. 

He could learn this language, 
of course. 

But by the time he had learned 
it, what would it have changed 
into? 

J ackson sighed and rubbed his 
face wearily. In a sense it 
was inevitable. All languages 
change. But on Earth and the few 
dozen worlds she had contacted, 
the languages changed with rel- 
ative slowness. 

On Na, the rate of change was 
faster. Quite a bit faster. 

The Na language changed like 
fashions change ’'on Earth, only 
faster. It changed like prices 
change or like the weather chang- 
es. It changed endlessly and in- 
cessantly, in accordance with un- 

GALAXY 



known rules and invisible prin- 
ciples. It changed its form like 
an avalanche changes its shape. 
Compared with it, English was 
like a glacier. 

The Na language was, truly 
and monstrously, a simulacrum 
of Heraclitus’s river. 

You cannot step into the same 
river twice, said Heraclitus: for 
other waters are forever flowing 
on. 

Concerning the language of 
Na, this was simply and literally 
true. 

That made it bad enough. But 
even worse was the fact that an 
observer like Jackson could never 
hope to fix or isolate even one 
term out of the dynamic shifting 
network of terms that composed 
the Na language. For the observ- 
er's action would be gross enough 
by itself to disrupt and alter the 
system, causing it to change un- 
predictably. And so, if the term 
were isolated, its relationship to 
the other terms in the system 
would necessarily be destroyed, 
and the term itself, by definition, 
would be false. 

By the fact of its change, the 
language was rendered imperv- 
ious to codification and control. 
Tlirough indeterminacy, the Na 
longue resisted all attempts to 
coiu|uer it. And Jackson had 
gone from Heraclitus to Heisen- 
berg without touching second 
base. He was dazed and dazzled, 
SHALL WE HAVE A LITTLE TALK? 



'and he looked upon the officials 
with something approaching awe. 

“You’ve done it, boys,” he told 
them. “You’ve beaten the system. 
Old Earth could swallow you and 
never notice the difference: yoU 
couldn’t do a damned thing about 
it. But the folks back home like 
their legalism, and our law says 
that we must be in a state of 
communication as a prior condi- 
tion to any transaction.” 

“Mun?” Erum asked politely. 

“So I guess that means I leave 
you folks alone,” Jackson said. 
“At least, I do as long as they 
keep that law on the books. But 
what the hell, a reprieve 's the 
best anyone can ask for. Eh?” 

“Mun mun,” the mayor said 
hesitantly. 

“I’ll be getting along now,” 
Jackson said. “Fair’s fair . 
But if I ever find out that you 
Naians were putting one over on 
me — ” 

He left the sentence unfinished. 
Without another word, Jackson 
turned and went back to his ship. 

In half an hour he was space- 
worthy, and fifteen minutes after 
that he was underway. 

VI 

I n Emm’s office, the officials 
watched while Jackson’s 
spaceship glowed like a comet in 
the dark afternoon sky. It dwin- 
dled to a brilliant needle-point, 

193 



and then vanished into the vast- 
ness of space. 

The officials were silent for a 
moment; then they turned and 
looked at each other. Suddenly, 
spontaneously, they burst into 
laughter. Harder and harder they 
laughed, clutching their sides 
while tears rolled down their 
cheeks. 

The mayor was the first to 
check the hysteria. Getting a grip 
on himself he said, “Mun, mun, 
mun-mun.” 

This thought instantly sobered 
the others. Their mirth died 
away. Uneasily they contemplat- 
ed the distant unfriendly sky, and 
they thought back over their re- 
cent adventures. 

At last young Erum asked, 
“Mun-mun? Mun-mun?” 

Several of the officials smiled 
at the naivete of the question. 
And yet, none could answer that 
simple yet crucial demand. Why 
indeed? Did anyone dare hazard 
even a guess? 

It was a perplexity leaving in 
doubt not only the future but the 
past as well. And, if a real an- 
swer were unthinkable, then no 
answer at all was surely insup- 
portable. 

The silence grew, and Emm’s 



young mouth twisted downward 
in premature cynicism. He said 
quite harshly, “Mun! Mun-mun! 
Mun?” 

His shocking words were no 
more than the hasty cruelty of 
the young; but such a statement | 
could not go unchallenged. And ^ 
the venerable first alderman ’ 
stepped forward to essay a reply. 

“Mun mun, mun-mun,” the old 
man said, with disarming sim- 
plicity. “Mun mun mun-rnun? 
Mun mun-mun-mun. Mun mun 
mun; mun mun mun; mun mun. 
Mun, mun mun mun — mun mun 
mun. Mun-mun? Mun mun mun 
mun!” 

This straightforward declara- 
tion of faith pierced Erum to the 
core of his being. Tears sprang 
unanticipated to his eyes. All 
postures forgotten, he turned to 
the sky, clenched his fist and 
shouted, “Mun! Mun! Mun- 
mun!” 

Smiling serenely, the old aider- 
man murmured, “Mun-mun- 
mun; mun, mun-mun.” 

This was, ironically enough, ^ 
the marvellous and frightening 
truth of the situation. Perhaps 
it was just as well that the others 
did not hear.

Forgotten road to success in writing 



By J. D. Ratcliff 

T can’t imagine why more beginners don’t 
take the short road to publication — by 
writing magazine and newspaper articles. 

I've made a good living for 25 years 
writing articles, and I've enjoyed every 
minute of it. I’ve interviewed Nobel Prize 
winners and heads of state. I’ve covered 
stories from Basel to Bangkok to Buffalo. 

It’s a great life. No commuter trains to 
catch, no office routine. Whether I’m at 
home or abroad on a.ssignment, I write 
from eight to noon every day — no more, 
no less. My afternoons are my own. 

The market for articles is vast and hun- 
gry. Over 350,000 were sold last year to 
magazines alone. Editors want pieces on 
almost any subject that comes natural to 
you — but they demand that your writing 
be sound and professional. 

To teach professional writing techniques 
to serious beginners, I joined with Rod 
Serling, Faith Baldwin, Bennett Cerf, and 
eight other leading authors to start the 
Famous Writers School. 

We poured everything we know about 
successful writing into a new kind of 
course which trains you at home, in spare 
time. You begin with the fundamentals of 
all good writing. Then, you specialize in 
articles and other non-fiction. (Or in Fic- 
tion, Advertising or Business Writing.) 

You learn to write hy wriiinf’. Our in- 
structors, themselves all published au- 
thors, work with you by mail much as 
editors do with established writers. 

Our School is young. Yet students, many 
still in training, have broken into print in 
more than 60 publications. Several sold 
pieces they wrote as School assignments. 



Writing Aptitude Test offered 

To find out if you too can be a published 
writer, send for the School’s revealing Apti- 
tude Test. If you test well — or olTer other 
evidence of writing ability you may enroll. 
However, there is no obligation to do so.
