POWER FROM THE SUN — Solar power plant designed to produce electrical 
energy. Sun heat, collected by acres of gloss pones, four layers thick, is 
concentrated on tiers of water pipes. Water is heated to 250 degrees Fahren- 
heit under pressure, released into "flosh“ tanks (located in center of gloss 
panes) ond converted into steam. The toll, square tower cools water; balloon- 
like tonk is for water storoge. Problem: too expensive unless oil Earth's fuel is 
exhausted

you're that man. here's something chat will 
interest you. 

Not a magic formula— not a get*rich«quick 
scheme — but something more substantial, more 
practical. 

Of course, you need something more than just 
the desire to be an accountant. You've got to pay 
the price— be willing to study earnestly, thoroughly. 

Soil, wouldn't it be wonh your while to sacri- 
fice some of your leisure in favor of interesiiog 
borne study— over a comparatively brief period.^ 
Always provided that the rewards were good — a 
salary of $4,000 to S 10.000' 

An accountant's duties are interesting, varied 
and of real worth ro his employers. He has •fjmJtagf 

Do you feel chat such things aren't for you? 
Veil, don't be coo sure. Very possibly they fSH be! 

Why not. like so many before you. investigate 
LaSalle's modern Problem Method of training for 
an accountancy, position^ 

Just suppose you were permitted to work in a 
targe accounting house under the personal super- 
vision of an expert accountant. Suppose, with his 
aid. you studied accounting principles and solved 
problems day by day — easy ones at first— then 
more difficult ones. If you could do this — and 
could turn co him for advice as the problems be- 
came complex— soon you'd master them all. 

That's the training you follow in principle un- 
der (he LaSalle Problem Method. 

You cover accountancy from the basic Prin- 
ciples light up inrough Accoununcy Systems aisd 
Income Tax Procedure. Then you add C. P. A. 
Training and prepare for (he C. P. A examina- 
(sons. 

As you go along, you absorb the pnneiptes of 
Audiung, Cost Accounting. Business Law, Sta- 



cisticai Control. Organiation. Management and 
Finance. 

Your progress is as speedy as you care to make 
it — depending on your own eagerness to learn 
and the time you spend in study. 

Will recognition come.^ The only answer, as 
you know, is thai success ifvj come to the man 
who is really twneJ. Ir's possible your employers 
will notice your improvement in a very few weeks 
or months. Indeed, many LaSalle graduates have 
paid for their training— with increased earnings 
— before they have completed it! For accoununcs. 
who axe trained in orgamaation and management, 
are the executives of (he future.

A CHAT WITH 
THE EDITOR 

THE WORD “successful” is some- 
thing of a “gimmick”, and the defi- 
nition in the dictionary is rather 
ambiguous, too. “Resulting or ter- 
minating favorably or as desired; 
also, achieving success, wealth, posi- 
tion or the like. Syn. Prosperous, 
fortunate, thriving, flourishing.” It’s 
a popular definition, of course, but 
if you look at the word long and 
thoughtfully, you begin to see loop- 
holes in the dictionary definition 
— and after awhile (maybe years) 
you wind up with a definition all 
your own. 

What does “successful” mean? 
And to that question you might 
add: “Successful in what?” From 
that point you can go into a multi- 
tude of definitions and near-an- 
swers and generalities. Like the 
person voted by his or her class to 
be most successful. Like the twen- 
ty or thirty or some-number of 
men or women voted by some peo- 



ple to be the most successful in 
the country or the state or some- 
thing. 

But you can’t measure success 
that way. You can’t use a given 
yardstick; it is a nebulous quality 
and it must be broken down many 
times to get its shades of value. 
Like successful in what? Then: 
“Who is successful in what?” And 
still: “Who considers himself suc- 
cessful in what?” That which the 
public considers successful is en- 
tirely different from what the in- 
dividual might consider success 
for himself. 

Let’s go back to the old phrase, 
“there goes a successful man”. 
How does anyone but that person 
know he’s successful? Oh, you say, 
he’s president of the bank. Or, he 
made a million dollars last year. 
Or. he’s got fourteen children and 
feeds them three square meals a 
day. Or, he’s the world’s cham- 
pion bo.xer or swimmer or golfer. 
Sure, that’s got it square on the 
head — if being president, or hav- 
ing a million bucks, or having 
fourteen children or being cham- 
pion — if that is what he or she 
wants and it makes him happiest, 
then that person is successful. But 
it’s pretty safe to venture that — 
nine limes out of ten — this isn’t 
always the case, at least as far as 
the indivdual is concerned. 

A man’s life is made up of many 
facets and intangibles and if he’s 
hap|>y or successful in one of them 
he’s lucky or fortunate. 

Some years ago I met a blind 
man who raised strawberries on a 
little patch of ground less than an 
acre in size. They were wonderful 
strawberries and he was happy 



4 




raising them. Some people consid- 
ered him unfortunate. He con- 
sidered himself successful. Another 
time I met a retired railroad engi- 
neer whose worldly goods were 
certainly not pretentious. But after 
hearing him tell of his experiences 
during the early days of railroad- 
ing and brag about bringing in his 
train on time through some of the 
difficulties he faced and seeing his 
face light up with each story — you 
couldn’t doubt that his life had 
been a success. What was even more 
important, he thought it was. Con- 
versely, you can talk to people in 
the limelight, famous people who 
have been successful by the general 
yardstick, and they’ll sometimes 
open up and say “hell no! what I 
wanted was something else.” Some- 
times people who haven’t got it, 
have it more than you think. And 
sometimes those who seems to have 
it, haven’t got it after all. 

It is the inner .success of the in- 
dividual upon which hinges the 
ultimate success of mankind. Now, 
what is the ultimate success of man- 
kind? 

I would say that mankind has 
been successful, so far, in many 
ways. Simply propagating and liv- 
ing in such close quarters on this 
globe may be one. Gaining new 
knowledge of the universe and its 
components may be another. Beat- 
ing some diseases and lengthening 
the life of individuals may be still 
another. In these things we cannot 
doubt that mankind has been suc- 
cessful. But are these individual 
successes enough? There are other 
goals to strive for — and there is the 
fly in the ointment. Shadings and 
meanings that were part of each 



man’s personality have gone into 
making up the individual successes, 
and tliey color world leadership too. 
In leadership, personal success is 
not enough, yet the shadings en- 
ter into — let’s say — statesmanship. 
Whether war is avoided or plowed 
right into is a part of a personal or 
patriotic desire to achieve success. 
And the immediate success becomes 
the goal. But the ultimate success 
of mankind is a larger goal than 
that. What is that goal? And, hav- 
ing attained the goal, will mankind 
be “successful”? 

Let’s say the goal is the welfare 
of all the peoples of the world . 
and start all over again with states- 
manship. 

Or — with human nature? 

FOR SOME TIME now we have been 
reading some of the most interest- 
ing manuscripts that have ever 
come into this office. Not by pro- 
fessional standards, of course — but 
because they represent the ideas and 
imaginations of students in colleges 
all over the United States and Can- 
ada. These manuscripts are their 
answers to the theme question 
in IP’s first nationwide College 
Science Fiction Contest: “What 
Will Life In America Be Like 100 
Years From Now?” When the win- 
ners have been selected, seven 
young men and women will receive 
$2,000 in cash prizes, with $1,000 
going to the author of the man- 
uscript judged the best. The 
awards will be announced in next 
month’s issue (November), with 
the winning .stories appearing in 
subsequent issues. Don’t miss them; 
they contain some refreshingly new 
approaches to science fiction. — jlq

ESCAPE VELOCITY 



It was a duel to the death and Kraas’ had all the advantages, 
including offense and defense. Jonner had neither, 
but he employed an old equation peculiarly adaptable to the 
situation. And the proper equation properly worked . 

BY CHARLES L. FONTENAY 



M urdering stcin was easy. 

Kraag waited until Jonner 
donned his spacesuit and went out 
to have a personal look at the as- 
teroid. Even then Kraag held his 
patience, because he wanted Jon- 
ner to come back to the .ship un- 
suspecting. 

Kraag sat tensely at the back of 
the control room while Stein, the 
navigator and communications 
man, operated the radio. There 
was a brief period when Stein 
talked with Marsport, then he got 
in touch with Jonner. Until Jon- 
ner got some distance from the 
wrecked ship, most of their con- 
versation was an argument. 

“I still think two of us ought to 



go out and one stay at the ship,” 
argued Stein. “Kraag agrees with 
me. What if you fall into a crev- 
ice?” 

“There’s not much danger, and 
you’ve got a directional fix on me,” 
replied Jonner’s voice through the 
loudspeaker. “If we had a large 
crew. I’d agree we ought to explore 
in pairs. Since there are just three 
of us, only one ought to be endan- 
gered at a time. I’m the captain, so 
I’m it.” 

“Well, don’t get out of sight,” 
warned Stein. “We don’t have an 
atmosphere here to bounce radio 
waves over the horizon.” 

Through the glassite port, Kraag 
could see Jonner poking around at

the asteroid’s surface with his steel 
probe. Against the incredibly 
curved horizon, jonner’s suited fig- 
ure leaned at a slight angle under 
the black, star-studded sky. The 
distant sun gleamed from the 
sphere of his helmet. 

“Pretty smooth terrain,’’ re- 
marked Jonner. “It's not much of 
a planet, but it seems to have 
enough mass to pull down any 
mountains. Looks like there should 
be some hills, though. It must have 
been in a molten state when the 
original trans-Martian planet was 
broken up.’’ 

“That ought to mean high al- 
bedo,’’ said Stein. “Higher than it 
ought to be.” 

“Sounds more like Vesta,” said 
Jonner. “Sure we’re on Ceres?” 

Stein looked at the notes he had 
made from the ship’s instruments, 
before the crash. 

“The escape velocity was 1,552.41 
feet per second,” he said, “and the 
diameter 0.06. 1 figure the mass at 
.000108.” 

“All those figures are off accord- 
ing to the latest table for Ceres,” 
said Jonner. 

“The fellows that made that 
table were on Mars,” reminded 
Stein. “Vesta doesn’t have a 480- 
mile diameter. It must be Ceres.” 

“You’re the navigator,” surren- 
dered Jonndr. “I’ll lake your word 
for it.” 

The personnel sphere of the ship 
rested on the ground, tilted at al- 
most a 20-degrec angle from the 
horizontal. The tilt was no incon- 
venience, however. Each of the 
men weighed only five or six 
pounds here, and slippage was 
hardly noticeable. 

“I’ll turn you over to Kraag,” 



said Stein at last, glancing up at 
the chronometer. “It’s my day to 
fix supper, you know.” 

It was the signal Kraag had 
been waiting for. He reached be- 
hind him and fumbled in the rack 
for a gun. 

The one he brought out was 
Jonner’s, and it wasn’t a heat-gun 
but the ancient pistol Jonner swore 
by. Kraag put it back hurriedly, 
but not before Stein had turned in 
his chair and seen it. 

“What’s up, Kraag?” asked Stein 
without alarm. “Why the gun?” 

Kraag pulled a heat-gun from 
the rack. 

“Nothing’s up,” he said, and shot 
Stein. 

The ray burned into Stein’s 
shoulder, and Kraag swung it down 
across Stein’s chest to his stomach 
before relaxing his pressure on the 
trigger. 

“My God, Kraag!” gurgled 
Stein. Summoning a last effort, he 
croaked into the microphone: 
“Jonner! Watch out! Kraag 
shot. .” 

Kraag blasted him in the face, 
cutting him off. Stein’s body floated 
forward and upward out of the 
chair and began to settle slowly to- 
ward the slanting floor. 

“What’s going on, Stein?” came 
Jonner’s alarmed voice over the 
loudspeaker. “Stein? Stein!” 

“It’s all right, Jonner,” said 
Kraag as calmly as he could, when 
he could reach the microphone. 
“Stein just fainted.” 

There was silence from Jonner. 

“I’ll take care of Stein and then 
take over the mike till you get ready 
to come in,” said Kraag into the 
microphone. 

“I want to talk to Stein when he

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




comes around,” said Jonner. His 
voice sounded cold. 

So Jonner suspected something. 
Well, that couldn’t be helped. May- 
be he could be talked around. 

“All right, Jonner,” agreed 
Kraag soothingly. 

Stein’s body had to be hidden 
from Jonner, just in case Jonner 
got into the personnel sphere alive 
— something Kraag did not intend 
for him to do. When he had taken 
care of Jonner, he could dispose of 
both bodies before the rescue sliip 
got there. 

Dragging Stein’s body was like 
towing someone through water. It 
floated through the air of tlic sphere 
at Kraag's tug. settling slowly. His 
only problem was getting good lev- 
erage for pushing, .\fter some cogi- 
tation, he jammed the body into an 
empty food compartment two decks 
below the control room. 

Back in the control room, Kraag 
looked out the port. Jonner was 
closer to the personnel sphere now, 
looking toward it but not moving. 

Other portions of the ship, some 
jettisoned, some crumpled and 
broken apart by its crash, lay at 
varying distances from the person- 
nel sphere. Some of the parts were 
scattered out of sight beyond the 
horizon, a mile away. 

Kraag had not wanted to fool 
with the asteroid. There had been 
no question that they had to swing 
back off their original orbit toward 
Titan when the meteorite slashed 
open both of their hydrazine tanks. 
But Kraag’s idea had been to stay 
in space and try to turn back to- 
ward Mars before the fuel gave out. 

As the engineer, Kraag resented 
Jonner overruling him. Jonner had 
felt it safer to take an orbit around 

ESCAPE VELOCITY 



the asteroid and wait for rescue. 
But the fuel pumps had failed be- 
fore they could adjust to the orbit. 
Kraag would never forget that 
helpless waiting as they circled and 
circled, spiraling downward to the 
inevitable crash. 

He went back to the microphone. 
“Okay, Jonner.’’ he said. “What’s 
going on out there now?” 

“Where’s Stein?” countered Joii- 
ner. “I want to talk to him.” 

“He’s not feeling so good. Said 
he’d rather not try to get back up 
to the control room right now.” 
“Tell him to come to the mike 
anyhow. I don’t want to talk to you 
till I talk to Stein.” 

“Stein can't talk, I tell you. If 
you don't want to talk to me, then 
arc you ready to come in?” 

“.\nd get shot?” retorted Jonner. 
So Jonner’s suspicions were that 
definite. It was to be cxjKCted after 
the words Stein had been able to 
shout into the microphone. Jonner 
was nobody’s dumbbell. 

Kraag tired once more. 

“That’s a ridiculous idea, Jon- 
ner,” he said. “1 can’t figure why 
you’d say such a thing.” 

“You shot Stein,” said Jonner 
positively. “There’s no use your 
denying it. I know you shot Stein, 
and I’ll know it until Stein himself 
tells me it isn’t so.” 

Kraag knew Jonner too well to 
try to keep up the pretense any 
longer. He tried another tack. 

“Okay, so I shot Stein,” he ad- 
mitted. “That doesn’t mean I’ll 
shoot you. Come on in and talk it 
over. We can make a deal.” 

“If you shot Stein, why wouldn’t 
you shoot me?” asked Jonner logi- 
cally. 

“There wasn’t enough air for 

9 




three. There is, for two.” 

Jonner was silent for a moment. 
“So that’s why you did it,” he 
said then. “Figured it pretty close, 
didn’t you, Kraag?” 

“I’m the guy who has to watch 
supplies on this boat. 1 checked the 
oxygen after the crash broke open 
those three compartments on the 
supply deck. There’s 3800 pounds 
of oxygen left. It’ll take almut 22 
months for the rescue ship to get 
here from Mars. .\t 2.8 pounds of 
oxygen a day, you and 1 can make 
it, but it would have lasted the 
three of us only 15 months.” 

Jonner cursed him for a full min- 
ute, not loudly but with such in- 
tensity that Kraag felt his face get- 
ting warm. 

“You damn murderer!” finished 
Jonner. “You damn cold-blooded 
murderer!” 

“Cut it out, Jonner,” growled 
Kraag. “I can’t understand you 
and Stein. What were you expect- 
ing to save us? A miracle?” 

“I don’t feel like talking about it 
now,” said Jonner warily. “If you 
had only . Hell, Kraag, we’d 
been together a long time. Even if 
all of us had thought we were go- 
ing to die, 1 didn’t think we’d kill 
each other off like animals.” 

“Self-preservation is the first law 
of nature,” said Kraag cynically. 
“Better that two should die than 
three. Come on in. Jonner.” 

“That’s self-presei-vation? No 
thanks, Kraag. You know I’ll turn 
you in as a murderer when the 
rescue ship gets here. I have no 
hankering to walk up where you 
can burn me down.” 

“Okay, stay out there till your 
air gives out.” 

The airlock was not a comfort- 

10 



able place to spend one of the as- 
teroid’s seven-hour nights, but 
Kraag was afraid not to stand 
guard there with his heat-gun. He 
was afraid to sleep, too, for the air- 
lock combination was virtually 
noiseless and Jonner could open it 
from the outside. Jonner was un- 
armed, but Kraag had no hanker- 
ing for a hand-to-hand fight with 
the powerfully built captain inside 
the personnel sphere. Because the 
air would swish out of the lock in- 
stantly if Jonner ojicned it, Kraag 
had to wear a spacesuit. 

He tried to talk to Jonner several 
times, but got no answer. Toward 
dawn, Kraag do/ed olf, only to be 
brought awake with a start by Jon- 
ner’s voice in his earphones. 

“Good morning, Kraag,” said 
Jonner. There was iron in his voice. 
“Have a good night’s sleep?” 
“About as good as yours. I’d 
say,” retorted Kraag, wishing he 
could get his hands inside his hel- 
met to rub his eyes. 

“I slept fine. Found me a good 
foxhole just beyond the horizon.” 
“Damn you, Jonner! Where are 
you now?” 

“Go on and have breakfast, 
Kraag. I’m far enough away for 
you to see me. Take a look.” 
Kraag peered out of the upper- 
most airlock ports, one by one. 
They slanted at a bad angle, but 
through one of them he made out 
Jonner, standing half a mile away. 
Uncannily, as though he could see 
Kraag’s helmet at the port, Jott- 
ner waved. 

Kraag was afraid to take olT the 
sparesuit now because the supply 
deck had no ptorts and Jonner 
could get to the sliip in a hurry if 
he wanted to. He took off the hel- 



CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




met, though, and went up to the 
center deck. Hurriedly, he opened 
the cover of the port in the direc- 
tion he had seen Jonner. jonner 
was still in the same place, sitting 
down. 

Kraag heated breakfast and ate 
it with an eye on the p>ort. Jonner 
didn’t move. Kraag felt better when 
he had eaten, and went up to the 
control room. 

“Why don’t you give it up and 
come on in, Jonner?’’ he asked. 
“The o.xygen in that suit’s not good 
for more than another 1.') hours.” 

“That’s where you’re wrong, 
Kraag, and that’s what’s .so tragic 
about your murdering Stein,” said 
Jonner quietly. “You either forgot 
that we carried oxygen instead of 
nitric acid as the fuel oxidizer this 
trip or, being an engineer, you 
didn’t think of it except as fuel. 

“There’s enough oxygen in the 
tanks scattered over the landscape 
to keep a dozen men alive until the 
rescue ship gets here. It’s hard for 
me to get at, but I’ve already found 
I can manage it.” 

Kraag was profoundly .shocked. 
For a moment the enormity of what 
he had done in killing Stein almost 
overwhelmed him. It had been 
completely unncce.ssary. 

Then his self-reproach turned 
into a growing anger against Jon- 
ner. Jonner was always so reticent, 
always required his orders to be 
obeyed without explanation. Dur- 
ing the whole argument about tak- 
ing an orbit around the asteroid, 
during the whole time it had taken 
to spiral down to a crash, he had 
not told Kraag how he expected 
them to stay alive until they were 
rescued. 

Kraag hadn’t asked him, of 

ESCAPE VELOCITY 



course. Kraag had assumed Jonner 
was thinking in terms of his own 
figures. 

“I’m sorry about Stein,” said 
Kraag, and meant it. “But it can’t 
be helped now, Jonner. There’s 
enough air for both of us, if you'll 
keep your mouth shut when the 
rescue ship gets here.” 

“If I promised, I still wouldn’t 
trust you and you wouldn’t trust 
tne. No, Kraag. The only way it’ll 
work is for you to come out un- 
armed and let me go in and get the 
guns. Then I’ll lock you in the con- 
trol room till the rescue ship gets 
here.” 

“One of us is a fool, Jonner, and 
you seem to think it’s me. I'm not 
going to burn for murder. I’ve got 
the whip hand. You may have oxy- 
gen, but you’ve got to have food 
and water, too.” 

Jonner laughed, without humor. 

“I’ve got enough of that for three 
Earth days and I can last longer,” 
he said. “Before that time, I’ll come 
and get you, Kraag. Don’t go to 
sleep!” 

Kraag cursed and switched off 
the loudspeaker. But he kept an 
eye on Jonner through the glassite. 
Always, he had to watch Jonner — 
or stay on guard in the airlock. 

If there were only some way to 
lock Jonner out! But the only real 
lock was on the control room, and 
a man couldn't live in the control 
room with an enemy below who 
could cut the water and oxygen 
lines. 

Kraag would have to sleep .some 
time. Jonner couldn’t know when, 
but Jonner already was ses'cn hours 
sleep up on him. Jonner could pick 
his own time to slip up to the 
sphere under cover of darkness, he 

11 




could pick his own time to come 
through the lock. Maybe Kraag 
would be awake and could burn 
him down — but maybe not. 

There was only one thing to do. 
He’d have to take the attack to 
Jonner. 

S TILL watching Jonner through 
every port he passed, always 
watching Jonner, Kraag hung a 
heat-gun on one of the hooks at his 
spacesuit’s belt. He went back be- 
low, put the helmet on, and went 
out through the airlock. 

The shadow of the sphere 
stretched away toward his left. He 
was in sunlight. 

Jonner, still in the same spot, 
got to his feet but made no move 
to approach. 

“Welcome to the great out- 
doors,” said Jonner. 

“I’m going to get you, Jonner,” 
said Kraag grimly. “One way or 
another. I’m going to get you.” 

He moved toward Jonner. Each 
step was a long, floating leap and it 
was hard to stay balanced before 
landing. Jonner moved, not away 
from him but sidewise. 

Kraag stopped. The effective 
range of the heat-gun was no more 
than 100 feet. If he tried to get 
close enough to Jonner to use it, 
Jonner could circle and get to the 
personnel sphere. 

There were the oxygen tanks, the 
big ones used for fuel. If Kraag 
could get to them and bum them 
open, Jonner couldn’t last long out- 
side. But they were scattered pretty 
far from the personnel sphere. Jon- 
ner would get to the sphere for 
sure if he tried that. 

12 



“Okay, Jonner, I know when 
I’m licked,” said Kraag. “Come on 
in.” 

“I’m not too far away to see the 
gun, Kraag.” 

“I’ll take it back to the sphere 
and leave it.” 

“Why not just toss it away?” 

“And have you beat me to it and 
get the drop on me? We’ll leave the 
guns in the sphere and I’ll meet 
you on even terms.” 

“I’ll believe it when I see it.” 

Kraag went back to the sphere. 
He couldn’t stand in shadow with- 
out looking suspicious, but he took 
the heat-gun from his belt osten- 
tatiously and swung it in an arc, 
apparently tossing it through the 
open outer lock. Instead, he held 
onto it and hung it by the trigger 
guard to a belt hook at the back of 
his suit. 

“I’m all clean, Jonner. Come on 
up,” he invited. 

“Let’s see the hooks, Kraag,” 
said Jonner. 

Kraag held his arms aloft, wrig- 
gling the empty steel fingers of the 
spacesuit. Jonner came toward him, 
floating high above the surface with 
each step. At just about the extreme 
range of the heat-gun, he stopped. 
Kraag kept his arms outspread, but 
tensed himself. 

“Clean, so far,” said Jonner 
drily. “Now turn around, Kraag.” 

“And have you jump me from 
behind? Not hardly.” 

“Gun on the back hook, eh, 
Kraag?” 

“Damn you, Jonner!” Kraag 
reached behind him for the gun 
and at the same time leaped 
toward Jonner. Jonner, ready, 
jumped back, and Jonner was a 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




more powerful man. Handling a 
heat-gun with the hand-hooks of a 
spacesuit is awkward business, and 
by the time Kraag could bring the 
weapon to bear on Jonner and 
press the trigger, jonner’s distance 
was such that the ray obviously did 
no worse than make things uncom- 
fortably warm for him. 

“I didn’t think that surrender 
rang true,” commented Jonner. “If 
you’d been Ie\el, you’d have tossed 
away the heat-gun.” 

Then Jonner revealed that he 
was not entirely weaponless. As he 
hit the surface, his arm moved in 
an arc and a good-sized rock came 
hurtling through space toward 
Kraag. 

Kraag writhed frantically, two 
feet off the ground, and the stone 
missed him by inches. Kraag landed 
on his side and bounced again. Jon- 
ner hit once more and hurled an- 
other rock. Evidently he was armed 
with .several of them. This one 
ricocheted off the ground near 
Kraag just as Kraag finally .slid to 
rest. 

Getting to his feet and turning 
to flee was agonizingly slow, when 
every frantic movement lifted him 
off the ground. Another stone came 
sailing by, to strike the personnel 
sphere and rebound at an angle, be- 
fore Kraag could jump back, away 
from Jonner. 

Perspiring and panting, he clam- 
bered hastily back into the safety of 
the airlock. 

Jonner’s rocks were a better 
weapon than a heat-gun, Kraag 
realized. They weighed only a frac- 
tion of an ounce and Jonner could 
fling them an amazing distance. But 
their mass was just the same as 
ever, and a jagged one could rip a 

ESCAPE VELOCITY 



fatal hole in a spacesuit. He had no 
intention of engaging in a stone- 
throwing duel with Jonner, in 
which Jonner would be at least on 
equal terms with him. * 

On the other hand, it was even 
more imperative than before that 
he eliminate Jonner as soon as pos- 
sible. A rock could be a deadly 
weapon if Jonner got inside the 
sphere, too. 

At any rate, there was no point 
in concealing Stein's body from 
Jonner any longer and Kraag 
couldn’t take chances on it pollut- 
ing the atmosphere of the sphere. 
He dragged the corpse from the 
food compartment, down to the air- 
lock, and pushed it out onto the 
surface of Ceres. The body settled 
stiffly to the ground a few feet 
away. 

Kraag removed his helmet and 
hand-hooks, went back up to the 
control room and settled himself 
to watch Jonner. Jonner walked 
around freely, periodically hurling 
rocks at the sphere. The rocks 
bounced off without damage, but 
every time one of them hit the 
hull, the sound of it rang through 
the sphere. 

Kraag switched on the commu- 
nications system. 

“Do you have to do that?” he 
demanded in irritation. “It’s not 
doing you any good.” 

“Keeping me in practice,” re- 
plied Jonner cheerfully. “I devel- 
oped a pretty good arm throwing 
grenades in the Charax Uprising.” 

Jonner was a veteran of that 
brief but savage war on Mars, and 
sometimes reminisced about it. It 
was there he had developed his 
preference for the old-style pro- 
jectile pistol over the heat-gun. 



13 





K RAAG’S eyes lingered on Jon- 
ner’s pistol, hanging in the 
rack with the heat-guns, and slow- 
ly an idea spread through his mind. 
The heat-gun range was the same 
anywhere, but the range of a pro- 
jectile weapon .should be greater 
hefe than on Mars or Earth. Its 
range should be far greater than 
Jonner’s rocks. 

Kraag took it from the rack and 
turned it over in his hand, study- 
ing it. He wasn’t sure of its princi- 
ple, but thought it was something 
on the order of rocket fuel. It 
should fire without an atmosphere 
around it. 

There were some figures stamped 
on the barrel: “COLT 1985, 

Cal-.45, MV- 11 00, Ser-456 17298.” 
Kraag puzzled over them. He knew 
the first one was the make and year 
and the last undoubtedly was the 
serial number. He deduced that 
“MV-llOO” probably was a figure 
showing tlie relationship between 

14 



the projectile’s mass and velocity. 
But it had been a long time since 
projectile weapons were common. 

He called on the memory of a 
demonstration of the weapon Jon- 
ner had given his companions once 
on Mars. There was something that 
had to be done to prepare it for 
firing. Holding it in his right hand, 
Kraag grasped the barrel with his 
left. After a moment of hesitant 
tugging, he hit the right movement 
and the whole outer casing of the 
barrel slid backward and clicked. 
It snapped back into position as 
Kraag released it, and he remem- 
bered. 

The gun was primed now. All 
he had to do was press the trigger 
and it would fire. It would auto- 
matically prime itself again after 
firing. It would fire each time he 
pressed the trigger now, until it ex- 
hausted its projectiles. 

Exultant, he laid it carefully in a 
contour chair, where it wouldn’t 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




slide out. He put his helmet back 
on and replaced the hand-hooks of 
his spacesuit. 

He looked out several ports be- 
fore he found Jonner. The captain 
was not more than 150 feet away, 
casually lobbing rocks at the sphere. 

Kraag picked up jonner’s pistol 
and made his way down to tlie air- 
lock. He emerged and walked 
around the sphere to the side where 
he had located Jonner. 

Jonner was moving away now, 
though he couldn't have known 
Kraag was coming out. He was 
about 300 feet away — too far for a 
heat-gun, but certainly w'ithin range 
of the projectile weapon. He 
seemed to be headed tow'ard one 
of the big fuel tanks. 

Kraag levelled the pistol toward 
Jonner and pulled the trigger. To 
his astonishment, he was hurtled 
backward, heels over head. 

The kick of a .45 on an asteroid 
is pretty powerful. Kraag must 

ESCAPE VELOCITY 



have bounced 50 feet backward 
over the terrain before he slid to 
rest on his stomach. But he held on 
to the pistol— and, since he never 
had a chance to release the pres- 
sure of his hand-hook on the trig- 
ger, it did not fire again. 

When lie struggled upright, Jon- 
ner was standing at the edge of the 
fuel tank, watching him. 

“Using my gun now, ch, Kraag?” 
Jonner said. “You’d better stick to 
weapons you know something 
about.” 

With that, he disappeared be- 
hind the fuel tank. 

Kraag got to his feet and ad- 
vanced confidently. His heat-gun 
was still hanging at his belt if he 
got close enough to Jonner to use 
it, and he could fire the projectile 
weapon at Jonner when Jonner was 
out of heat-gun range. 

He was learning. One had to 
point the projectile gun accurately 
before firing. It couldn’t be swung 

15 



around and focussed while press- 
ing the trigger, like a heat-gun. He 
might miss a few times, but he 
ought to be able to hit Jonncr at 
least once before the ammunition 
was exhausted. Once should be 
enough. 

Heat-gun ready in his left hand, 
projectile gun in his right, Kraag 
circled the fuel tank. Keeping it 
between them, Jonner had headed 
straight for the horizon, running in 
long, shallow leaps. He was at least 
half a mile away. 

Kraag pointed the projectile pis- 
tol and pulled the trigger. Nothing 
happened. Then he realized that 
he had never released the pressure 
of his hand-hook on the trigger 
after firing the first time. He let up 
on it and pressed it down. 

And again Kraag was hurled 
backward, but this time he was 
smashed against the fuel tank and 
rebounded forward, falling on his 
face. By the time he reached his 
feet again, Jonner had vanished 
over the horizon. 

Cursing softly, Kraag made his 
way back to the personnel sphere. 
He had hoped to get Jonner with 
that shot. He was very sleepy, and 
now he was faced with another 
night on guard. 

He entered the airlock, pushed 
himself gently upward to catch the 
rungs of the metal ladder and 
turned the wheel of the airlock’s 
inner door. 

Nothing happened. The door did 
not open. 

Fear gripped him like a paralyz- 
ing hand. For a moment he thought 
Jonner had managed to get to the 
sphere ahead of him and somehow 
had locked him out. But that was 
impossible. Then he thought the 

16 



inner door might be jammed, and 
he and Jonner locked out together. 

He glanced frantically below 
him, then broke into relieved 
laughter. He had left the outer air- 
lock door open. As a safety meas- 
ure against the sphere’s accidental- 
ly losing its air, neither door would 
open unless the other was shut. 

And that meant he could lock 
Jonner out of the sphere simply by 
leaving the inner door of the air- 
lock open! 

His laugh was full and genuine 
now as he pulled the outer door 
closed. 

“Having fun, Kraag?” asked 
Jonner in his earphones. 

“Just looking forward to a good 
night’s sleep, for a change,” re- 
torted Kraag triumphantly. “Prowl 
around all you want to, Jonner. I 
can wait you out, now.” 

“The airlock, eh? I wondered 
when your guilty conscience would 
settle down and let you remember 
about that airlock,” said Jonner 
phlegmatically. “You know, Kraag, 
I had no idea you wouldn’t think 
about a simple thing like that, till I 
looked through the airlock port last 
night and saw you huddled up there 
with a heat-gun. You should have 
turned out the light.” 

Jonner was silent for a few min- 
utes. Then he added: 

“I don’t think I’d laugh yet, 
though, Kraag. Remember, you’re 
fighting with my weapons.” 

Kraag wasn’t sure what he meant 
by that: whether he was talking 
about Kraag’s using the projectile 
pistol or the fact that they were in 
space, Jonner’s natural element. 
Kraag himself had been in space 
10 years, most of it with Jonner, 
but before then he had never left 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




Earth. Jonner had been born and 
raised on Mars, where a man 
needed a suit to go to the next set- 
tlement, and he had been on a ship 
since he was 15. 

As for using the pistol, Kraag 
could sec danger for no one but 
Jonner. He had proved, twice, that 
he could fire it. He was quite sure 
the old-fashioned wcap>on was no 
more likely to e.xplode than a heat- 
gun. The only trouble he foresaw 
was figuring how to reload it if he 
used up all its projectiles before 
hitting Jonner. 

Kraag shrugged and removed his 
suit. He was hungr\’, and he was 
looking forward to a supper better 
than Jonner had available in the 
concentrated supplies in his space- 
suit. Jonner’s food and water by- 
now had dwindled to less than 60 
hours’ supply, unless he was weak- 
ening himself by going on slim ra- 
tions. 



A S HE wolfed down his supper, 
Kraag took stock of his situa- 
tion. He could sec no flaw in his 
position. .-Ml he had to do was sit 
back and wait. 

He decided not to destroy the 
tanks that were Jonner’s supply of 
extra oxygen. After all, Jonner 
could not last beyond his food and 
water supply. The presence of the 
oxygen made his case airtight. He 
could disjx)se of the bodies of Stein 
and Jonner and tell the crew of the 
rescue ship they had wandered off 
on an exploration tour and never 
returned. With plenty of oxygen 
for the three of them, no motive 
could be established, against him 
for the murders. ^ 

He began to feel rather sorry for 

ESCAPE VELOCITY 



Jonner. They had been com- 
panions, and Stein with them, for 
a long time. 

After eating, he went up to the 
control room and turned Jonner in 
on the communications system. He 
was genuinely regretful that Jonner 
had to die so soon. It would be 
lonesome on the asteroid with no 
cne to talk to. 

“I hope you’ve been keeping the 
radio open to Marsport, in case 
there were any inquiries,” said Jon- 
ner. “If they get the idea we’re all 
dead out here, they may call off the 
rescue.” 

“The last time tliey called was 
right after you left the ship,” said 
Kraag. “Stein was going to tell you, 
but 1 suppose he forgot it. Marsport 
knows where we are. A rescue ship 
should have blasted off by now.” 

“That’s the advantage of being 
on Ceres instead of in space,” Jon- 
ner pointed out. “They know Ceres’ 
orbit, but they'd have to have sev- 
eral directional fixes on us, spaced 
several days apart, to pinpoint us 
if the ship were in space. What did 
Stein say the escape velocity here 
is?” 

Surprised at the unexpected 
question, Kraag consulted the notes 
Stein had left lying in the control 
room. 

“EV 1,552.41 feet per second,” 
he replied. “Not figuring on jump- 
ing off the planet, are you, Jon- 
ner?” 

“Maybe,” said Jonner. 

“Well, don’t wake me up if you 
do. I’m really going to pound the 
pillow tonight.” 

Jonner laughed shortly, and 
Kraag heard the click as the cap- 
tain switched off his helmet radio. 
He grinned. 



17 




Kraag was asleep almost as soon 
as he hit the bunk. 

He came awake slowly, reluc- 
tantly, knowing he had not had all 
the sleep he needed. Something was 
pounding noisily somewhere, ring- 
ing through his head. 

He shook his head to clear it. 
For just an instant there was si- 
lence in the utter darkness. Then: 
CRASH! 

Like a clap of thunder the noise 
reverberated through the metal hull 
of the sphere. 

Kraag started violently, and only 
the bunk straps kept him from 
rocketing to the ceiling. Again: 
CRASH! 

And Kraag could feel the sphere 
shiver with the blow. 

He switched on the lights just as 
another terrific crash sounded. This 
time he could see everything on the 
central deck quiver with the im- 
pact. 

One of the four small ports 
around the central deck was \m- 
covered, and the light threw a 
beam out into the blade night of the 
asteroid. It brought a temp>orary 
cessation of the regular blows. Dur- 
ing the interval, Kraag unstrapped 
himself and tumbled up to the con- 
trol room, to switch on the com- 
munications system. 

“Jonner!” he shouted. “Jonner, 
what in hell?” 

“I'm not deaf,” said the loud- 
speaker resentfully. “Give me a 
chance to turn down my volume, if 
you’re going to holler.” 

“What the devil are you doing 
out there, Jonner?” 

“W'hat I promised you. I’m com- 
ing in after you.” 

Kraag swore. 

“I’m going to blow you off the 
18 



damned planet,” he threatened, 
and leaped for the gun rack. 

“You’ll have to come outside to 
do it,” reminded Jonner. “If you 
try to shoot through the ports, 
you’ll save me a lot of work.” 

Kraag raced up and down the 
sphere twice before he had sense 
enough to turn out all the lights 
and use the searchlight. Then he 
located Jonner, clinging to the 
sphere outside the astrodome on 
the navigation deck. Jonner had a 
sledge hammer from the ship’s 
cargo section in his hand. 

Jonner grinned at him and 
moved quickly out of the search- 
light’s beam. Ten seconds later, an- 
other thunderous crash sounded, 
apparently from the other side of 
the sphere. Kraag swung the light 
in a circle, but Jonner could move 
faster than the beam. 

Hastily, Kraag made another 
tour of the sphere, this lime clos- 
ing all the metal covers over the 
ports. When he reached the control 
room, Jonner’s voice was calling 
him over the loudspeaker, repeat- 
ing his name every few seconds. 

“What do you want?” demanded 
Kraag, panting. 

“Just wanted to tell you I could 
have knocked out the astrodome or 
one of the ports before you woke 
up,” said Jonner cheerfully. “I 
don’t want to kill you, Kraag. 1 just 
want you to surrender, and if you 
don’t I can eventually batter 
through the meteor shield and the 
hull, and ruin the sphere for you.” 

“We’ll see about that,” gritted 
Kraag. Hurriedly he donned a 
spacesuit. Hanging Jonner’s pistol 
at hb belt, he took a heat-gun in 
his right hand and a flashlight in 
hb left and ventured out through 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




the airlock. He did not make the 
mistake of switching on the airlock 
light, but Jonner seemed to know 
when he emerged, possibly from the 
vibration when the lock opened. 

“Nice night out, isn’t it, Kraag?” 
Jonner welcomed him. 

Kraag grunted. The night was 
black as pitch. The only way he 
could tell where the ground ended 
and the sky began was that the sky 
was jewelled with stars. 

He turned the light on and 
flashed it over the sphere. No sign 
of Jonner. But a rock struck his 
helmet and bounced off with a 
clang that nearly knocked him 
down and left him momentarily 
dizzy. 

“I’m behind you, Kraag,” said 
Jonner pleasantly. “Better go back 
inside. I promise not to break your 
shell open tonight.” 

Kraag twisted around and fired 
the heat-gun even as he searched 
for Jonner with the flashlight. Both 
beams pierced emptiness. Jonner 
just laughed at him. 

Afraid now that Jonner would 
get into the sphere, Kraag scuttled 
back around to the airlock. Heat- 
gun ready, he turned on the light 
before closing the outer door, and 
breathed a sigh of relief at finding 
it empty. 

Trembling with reaction, he 
closed the outer lock, left the inner 
one open and made his way up to 
the center deck. He needed coffee. 

“I see you’ve gone back to the 
heat-gun,” said Jonner. “That’s 
smart.” 

“You’d like to see me exhaust 
the fuel tank of your pistol shooting 
it in the dark, when I can’t hit you, 
wouldn’t you?” retorted Kraag. 

ESCAPE VELOCITY 



“No, thanks. I’ll keep it for long 
distances.” 

"Fuel tank? Oh, you mean the 
magazine.” Jonner laughed. “I’d 
stay away from that old .45 of mine 
if I were you, Kraag. It’s been with 
me too long. It’s a lot more likely to 
turn on my enemies than to do me 
any harm.” 

“Rot!” snapped Kraag. “It’s a 
gun. All I have to do is get the 
hang of aiming it properly.” 

“I wouldn’t use too much power 
tonight, either,” warned Jonner. 
“You don’t get much with the solar 
mirror this far out. Anyhow, I took 
the mirror off while you were hav- 
ing your nap. The batteries should 
give out in a few hours.” 

Without answering, Kraag 
switched off his radio and removed 
his helmet. That last bit of infor- 
mation was a blow. Gradually, Jon- 
ner was stripping Kraag down to 
his own subsistence level. 

Power or not, Kraag was deter- 
mined to have his coffee. But first 
he went over the sphere again and 
switched off all unnecessary lights. 

Jonner was a man who kept his 
word, but Kraag couldn’t afford to 
trust him. Jonner might change his 
mind and try to break open the 
sphere again before morning. 
Kraag kept his spacesuit on. He 
did not sleep too well, for about 
once every 30 or 40 minutes some- 
thing — either a large rock or Jon- 
ner’s sledge hammer — would strike 
the sphere a resounding blow. 

W HEN Kraag’s watch told him 
it was morning, he opened the 
ports of the center deck and let the 
weak sunlight stream into the 
sphere. Off to the east, he saw Jon- 

19 




ner digging with a pick from the 
cargo. Jonner was far enough away 
for his legs from the knees down 
to be hidden by the extreme curva- 
ture of the little planet. 

Kraag’s first impulse was to go 
out and take a pot shot at him. In- 
stead, he switched on the short- 
wave cooker and prepared some 
breakfast. Taking it up to the con- 
trol room, where he could switch 
on the communications system, he 
opened the eastern port and 
watched Jonner. This high, he 
could see Jonner’s feet and the hole 
he was digging — and Stein’s body. 

Jonner had taken Stein’s body 
from the spot outside the sphere 
where Kraag had pushed it. He 
was burying Stein. 

Jonner finished his excavation 
and laid Stein gently to rest in it. 
|He pushed rocks back in to fill it 
up, and wrested a boulder that 
would have weighed a ton over it 
for a monument. Then he mur- 
mured a brief prayer over the 
grave. 

Kraag was ashamed and then, 
tinaccountably, angry. But he stood 
at the port, drinking his coffee and 
watching Jonner, and said nothing. 

Either with chalk or with some 
soft rock he had found — Kraag 
could not tell which — Jonner wrote 
something on the big stone that 
was Stein’s monument. Then he 
stood up and turned toward the 
sphere. 

“Kraag,” he said. “Kraag, are 
you tuned in?” 

“Yes,” replied Kraag shortly. 

“You have today to surrender. 
Tonight I’m going to hatch you out 
of your comfortable egg.” 

Kraag switched off the commu- 
nications system and paced the 

20 



room, anger burning slowly inside 
him. This was ridiculous. He held 
all the cards. He had the guns, he 
had the sphere. Jonner was outside, 
weaponless, with a limited supply 
of food and water. Yet Jonner had 
him on the defensive. 

How had it happened? How 
could it happen? Kraag lit a ciga- 
rette and puffed at it slowly, apply- 
ing his mind coldly to the situa- 
tion. 

He didn’t doubt that Jonner 
would do as he threatened, but he 
didn’t think it was the recklessness 
of desperation. More likely, Jonner 
deliberately, calculatingly, planned 
to reduce his own chances for com- 
fort, in order to bring Kraag down 
to more even terms with him. 

If Jonner broke the hull of the 
sphere, it could be repaired — by 
someone working outside, free 
from interruption by an enemy. 
Until it was repaired, it would 
mean that Kraag, too, would have 
to live in a spacesuit. And Jonner 
might knock open a hole, or more 
than one, big enough to permit him 
to enter the sphere and attack 
Kraag in the darkness. 

If only he could surround the 
sphere with light at night, he could 
keep Jonner at a distance. But with 
the solar mirror gone, the search- 
light, on top of the sphere’s other 
electrical requirements, would dis- 
charge the batteries before the 
flight was half gone. 

Kraag knew Jonner’s stubborn- 
ness, his resourcefulness, his raw 
courage. Jonner was the one of 
them who was really at bay, when 
you considered it. Yet Kraag felt 
that Jonner was closing in on him, 
gradually, inexorably. 

Facing this, Kraag felt the steel 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




enter his own will. He wasn’t a 
coward. He had just been expecting 
this to be too easy. If Jonner would 
force him to fight, he would fight. 
He still had the advantage. 

He must abandon the sphere as 
an asset. Jonner could take that 
away from him anyhow. On the 
other hand, if Jonner took over the 
sphere, Kraag could use the same 
weapxm against him. He could 
break open the sphere. 

So the sphere was no longer a 
factor. The food and water were 
no longer a factor, for food and 
water went with the sphere. He 
would admit Jonner to equality in 
those supplies — not full equality, 
for he could provision himself now 
more fully than Jonner had been 
provisioned two Ceres days earlier. 
He still might pin Jonner down as 
Jonner tried to get to the sphere 
for more supplies. 

Then Kraag’s remaining advan- 
tage lay in the guns. They should 
be enough. If he could get close 
enough to use a heat-gun, he could 
blast Jonner. Jonner’s own projec- 
tile weapon would keep Jonner out 
of rock-throwing range, and sooner 
or later he would hit Jonner with 
it. He couldn’t keep on missing; the 
law of average would give him a 
hit sooner or later. And all he 
needed was just one . 

Kraag provisioned his spacesuit 
and hung all three of the heat-guns 
at his belt. In one of the capacious 
outside pockets he put two spare 
flashlights and half a dozen of the 
extra fuel packets — What was it 
Jonner had called them? Maga- 
zines, that was it — for Jonner’s pro- 
jectile pistol. He took that pistol in 
hu right hand and sallied forth to 
do battle. 

ESCAPE VELOCITY 



J ONNER was nowhere in si^t. 

Kraag shut the outer lock to 
make it appear he might be still in 
the sphere if Jonner happened not 
to spot him. He went over to Stein’s 
new grave. 

Jonner had written on the stone: 
REST IN PE.ACE. R. STEIN 
MURDERED BY A. KRAAG. 
DEC. 12, 2037. 

Angrily, Kraag burned the let- 
tering off in a 30-second blast with 
his heat-gun that left the face of 
Stein’s gravestone cherry red. 

He turned to survey the terrain, 
and saw Jonner. The captain was 
crouched half a mile away, appar- 
ently writing more on a flat rock 
or on the ground itself. 

Jonner was facing him, but his 
head was down and he hadn’t seen 
Kraag. If Kraag fired the projec- 
tile pistol, he probably would miss 
and might warn Jonner with the 
shot. He was sure of his accuracy 
with a heat-gun. Kraag took a 
heat-gun in his left hand and ran 
toward Jonner, 

Possibly the vibration of the 
ground warned Jonner. He looked 
up, jumped to his feet and Bed. As 
soon as he could stop and get hb 
feet planted firmly on the ground, 
Kraag fired the projectile pistol 
after him. He was still shooting 
low and to one side. 

Kraag picked himself up from 
the ground, where the backlash of 
the weap>on had knocked him, and 
went up to the spot where Jonner 
had been writing. A mathematical 
problem had been scratched on the 
surface with a sharp rock. Kraag 
had interrupted Joimer in the mid- 
dle of it. 

The figures that had been writ- 
ten were: 



21 




11 

1.141)1552.41 

141 

142 

141

Kraag stared at it, carrying out 
the rest of the simple mathematics 
in his head. The answer was 1101. 
But what was the problem? 

The figure “1.41” was familiar 
enough. It was the square root of 
two, carried to two decimal places. 
But what was Jonner dividing by 
it, and why? 

He frowned in concentration. 
There was something familiar 
about the numbers, something that 
had to do with him and Jonner, 
and Jonner wouldn’t be working 
arithmetic just for amusement. 

He saw Jonner moving on the 
horizon, just his head visible against 
the black sky, his body hidden by 
the curve of the planet. Jonner was 
circling. 

The sudden realization of dan- 
ger wiped other thoughts from his 
mind. Until he saw the epitaph 
Jonner had written for Stein, Kraag 
had thought Jonner looked at this 
as he did: one man against the 
other, and winner take all. But 
Jonner intended to win even if he 
lost, because Jonner was not fight- 
ing just for Jonner’s survival but 
for due process of law. 

Jonner was trying to make cer- 
tain that, even if Kraag killed him, 
Martian law would punish Kraag 
for Stein’s death. And if Jonner 
got into the sphere, he could get his 
message to Marsport or the rescue 
ship simply by turning on the radio. 

Kraag turned and raced back to 

22 



the sphere. He arrived, panting 
heavily. Jonner was nowhere in 
sight, but he knew Jonner, circling, 
could not have gotten there ahead 
of him. 

He must kill Jonner before night- 
fall, if he could, but he must not 
get far enough from the sphere to 
let Jonner slip in behind him. He 
was not ready, yet, to destroy the 
radio to keep Jonner from it. 

He walked around the sphere. 
There was Jonner on the other side, 
only his head above the horizon, 
moving clockwise. The sun flashed 
and gleamed from Jonner’s helmet. 

There was no sense in shooting 
at so small a target as a head. A 
mile away, Jonner’s whole body 
was a small enough target. A care- 
fully gauged leap carried Kraag to 
the top of the sphere. Here, 40 feet 
higher, his range of view was in- 
creased considerably. He could see 
Jonner well. 

Jonner could see him, too. Jon- 
ner stopped to hurl a stone. It took 
a while for the missile to cover the 
distance. It passed below Kraag’s 
level, some distance away from 
him. 

“Why don’t you give it up, Jon- 
ner?” asked Kraag. “You can’t 
hurt me with a rock, at this dis- 
tance.” 

“Why should I?” retorted Jon- 
ner. “All I have to do is wait tOl 
night.” 

“Sure, wait. But I’m not waiting, 
Jonner. One of us is going to win 
this thing before night, or I’m go- 
ing to blast the radio so you can’t 
reach Marsport. If I have to do 
that. I’ll track you down tomorrow 
— and I think I can stay outside 
and fight you away from the sphere 
tonight.” 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




“Getting desperate enough to 
fight like a man now, aren’t you, 
Kraag? If you want a showdown 
today. I’m willing.” 

Kraag’s mind was clear now. He 
had the situation under control. 
He glanced around the landscap>e 
at the scattered portions of the 
wrecked ship. There was the cargo 
hull, burst open, where Jonner had 
gotten his sledge hammer and the 
pick to bury Stein. Over there was 
a red sphere, ripped by the jagged 
gash of the meteor collision— one 
of the two hydra/ine fuel tanks. 
The yellow sphere 30 degrees away 
from it was an oxygen fuel tank. 

Kraag leveled Jonner’s gun and 
fired at the yellow sphere. The 
kick knocked him off the sphere, 
but as he somersaulted backwards 
he saw the projectile hit the ground. 
Still low and to one side. But he no- 
ticed something on the gun he 
hadn’t seen before. 

There were ridges for sighting 
along the barrel of Jonner’s pistol. 
Regaining his position atop the 
sphere, Kraag pressed his back 
against the obsersatory dome, to 
brace himself against the gun’s 
backlash. He aimed carefully at the 
yellow sphere and fired again. 

The yellow tank jumped — not 
from the impact, but from the 
spout of freed, expanding oxygen 
through the hole the bullet made. 
It moved and wobbled about in the 
weak gravity, like a dying balloon. 
When it stopped. Kraag knew he 
had destroyed half of Jonner’s oxy- 
gen supply. 

“Good shot, Kraag,” congratu- 
lated Jonner, with fatalistic irony 
in his tone. “Of course. I’m not as 
big a target as the tanks.” 

“Each target in its own time,” 

ESCAPE VELOCITY 



replied Kraag triumphantly, and 
looked around for the other yellow 
sphere. 

He had been afraid it might be 
one of the parts that had fallen 
over the horizon, but it wasn’t. It 
was behind him, a little closer than 
the first. He hit it with one shot. 

Now Jonner had only the oxygen 
in his spacesuit tanks. 

Jonner had made no effort to 
move farther away. He was still 
visible on the horizon, from the 
knees up, moving in a great circle 
around die personnel sphere. 

Kraag aimed carefully and fired. 
He did not know the projectile’s 
spieed, but certainly it would be 
much faster than Jonner’s rocks. 
After half a minute had passed, he 
knew he had missed. 

There was only one thing to do. 
He settled himself and fired again, 
trying to lead Jonner slightly. Again 
he missed. 

Methodically, taking his time, 
Kraag fired. Jormer walked on un- 
concernedly, circling. Kraag tried 
to fire so the path of his projectile 
would strike at the top of Jonner’s 
strides, for then Jonner rose several 
feet into the air and his whole body 
was visible. 

Occasionally, Jonner would stop 
and hurl a stone at Kraag. One 
man was as inaccurate as the other. 
Jonner’s stones went wide at that 
distance, and Kraag obviously had 
not hit Jonner with a bullet. 

At last Jonner stopped. He 
seemed to be fiddling with some- 
thing that was right on the ground, 
below Kraag’s line of vision. Then 
a tremendous stone, bigger than 
Kraag’s head, came hurtling to- 
ward the sphere. Kraag duck^ in- 
stinctively, but the missile passed 

23 




10 feet above him, still going well. 

“What in the devil!” exclaimed 
Kraag. 

“A little innovation of mine, to 
make things more interesting,” said 
Jonner. “In case you ever want to 
use the idea, I made me a .super- 
slingshot out of two of the jeep 
inner tubes from the cargo, and a 
couple of crowbars I could drive 
into crevices. Fixed it up yesterday 
for bombardment purposes.” 

The duel went on. 

There came the time when the 
hammer of the pistol clicked on an 
empty chamber. 

“How do you refuel this thing, 
Jonner?” asked Kraag pleasantly. 
The sun was still high. He could 
retreat to the interior of the sphere 
and figure it out if he had to. 

“It’s pretty hard to do with 
spacesuit hooks,” replied Jonner. 
“Be glad to demonstrate, if you’ll 
toss me the gun.” 

Kraag laughed, a laugh with 
more triumph in it than humor, be- 
cause in his fumbling he had just 
hit the button that ejected the 
magazine. To push in a fresh one 
was the matter of a moment. 

He had hoped Jonner would 
move in closer when he knew the 
pistol was empty, but no such luck. 
Jonner stayed put. 

Kraag’s first effort with the new 
magazine brought no results, for 
he had neglected to prime the 
weapon by pushing the outer cover- 
ing back on the barrel. He did this, 
and resumed his methodical firing. 

As the time wore on, Kraag be- 
gan to appreciate the difficulties 
involved in hitting a moving tar- 
get, even a slowly moving one, 
when the marksman was as in- 
experienced as he was. The trouble 

24 



was that, at that distance, he could 
not see where the bullets were 
striking and had no way of know- 
ing how wide of his mark he was 
shooting. 

He was on the fourth magazine 
and the sun had passed the merid- 
ian when he felt the sphere vibrate 
faintly and momentarily beneath 
him. He twisted around, alarmed. 
He could see nothing. It wasn’t 
one of Jonner’s rocks, because a big 
one had just missed. 

His eye detected a shining streak 
that stretched a few inches along 
the curve of the sphere’s meteor 
shield, at about the level of his feet. 
He bent to examine it. Something 
had struck it at high speed, a 
glancing blow. 

It couldn’t be one of Jonner’s 
rocks. Small meteor? 

A jagged hole suddenly appeared 
in the observatory dome near him. 
Kraag moved up and examined 
it closely. It had been made by 
some small object. Through the 
glassite he could see a similar hole 
in the other side of the dome. 

Did Jonner have some sort of 
new weapon? He couldn’t. Even 
Jonner wasn’t resourceful enough 
to invent a high-powered weapon 
with the innocuous cargo they were 
carrying for the Titan colony. 

Something struck Kraag a pow- 
erful blow in the left chest, a blow 
that hurled him sideways, to tumble 
off the sphere and fall slowly to 
the ground below. There was a 
great pain in his chest, and he 
released his hand-hooks in agony, 
so that the pistol fell away from 
him. 

Kraag gasped for breath as he 
struck the ground and bounced. 
He coughed up blood. 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




He fell slowly again, and bounced 
again. The third time he settled 
jarringly, prone on his back. 

He couldn’t understand what 
had happened to him. He pulled 
his right arm inside the suit with 
an effort and probed the painful 
area on his chest. He felt the hot 
wetness of flowing blood. 

He would have to get to the 
sphere. He tried to move. He 
couldn’t get off his back. He lay 
there and writhed in pain. 

Jonner’s voice was in his ears, 
saying something. 

“I knew it would get you,” 
jonner said. “It was my only 
chance. But it got you at last, 
Kraag.” 

“Come help me, Jonner,” whim- 
pered Kraag weakly. “I’ve been 
hit by ... I don’t know. It must 
have been a meteor.” 

“I’m coming as fast as I can, 
Kraag, but it was no meteor. It 
was my gun.” 

“Gun?” repeated Kraag won- 
deringly. 

“I warned you about that gun 
of mine, Kraag. If you’d looked 
at the figures on the barrel, the 
muzzle velocity of those .45-calibre 
bullets is 1100 feet a second. With 
Ceres’ escape velocity, that’s al- 
most exactly the circular velocity 
at the asteroid's surface.” 

Jonner was standing over him, 
and then was lifting him gently, to 



carry him to the sphere. 

“I deliberately got just out of 
your range of vision, from the 
ground, so you’d climb to a high 
spot,” said Jonner. “You had to be 
high, so the bullet would clear the 
irregularities on the planet’s sur- 
face, and I knew that sooner or 
later you'd shoot a bullet or two 
high enough not to hit the ground. 

“When you were firing at me, 
your bullets weren’t describing a 
trajectory and failing to the sur- 
face, as they would on Earth or 
Mars. They were taking an orbit 
tliat brought them all the way 
around the planet to the same spot, 
to hit you from the other side two 
hours later.” 

Kraag tried to look up at him. 
Something was going wrong with 
his right, and everything outride 
his face plate was a blur. Must be 
the oxygen . maybe his suit 
didn’t seal the bullet bole properly. 

“I thought . .” Kraag began, 
and choked. He coughed, slowly 
and painfully, then tried again: 
“I thought that .... problem on 
the rocks .... looked familiar.” 

“You’ve always done it with a 
slide rule. That’s probably why the 
long division didn’t register,” said 
Jonner. “The equation is one every 
spaceman knows: the circular ve- 
locity equals the escape velocity 
divided by the square root of two.”

QUICKIE 

Dr. Kinsey, meet Mr. Grover, the amorous adventurer. 
Even in a world of polygamous sexual 
relations and legal multiple marriages, here is the 
nation’s champion philanderer! 



BY MILTON LESSER 



S IMON GROVER always felt 
like a goldfish in a coptcrcab. 
The plexiglass bubble a Horded full 
360 degree vision, but people could 
also see you from the crowded 
traffic lanes above a big city. 

“Hurry,” said Simon Grover, a 
small, energetic man with close-set 
hazel eyes and a stubljorn chin. 

“I’m hurrying,” the pilot told 
him with frustrating indififercnce. 

In another few moments he 
would be safe. He squirmed around 
and saw another copter rise above 
the express lane and close the gap 
between them. It had never been 
this close before. The aquamarine 
roof of the Marriage Building 
loomed ahead, then swelled up at 
them. The other copter buzzed 
closer. 

“Don’t see any landing space,” 
the pilot said laconically. 

Simon squinted down anxiously. 
The copters were lined up in neat 



but crowded row's on the rooftop, 
with hardly more than walking 
space between them. 

“Hover,” Simon pleaded. “I’ll 
jump.” 

“I could lose my license.”- 

Simon reached into his pocket 
and drew out a handful of bills. 
“This is important to me,” he said. 

The pilot pocketed the money, 
then sw'ooped down toward the 
roof. Suspended grotesquely eight 
feet above the aquamarine surface, 
blades whirling, the coptercab 
hovered. Simon grunted his thanks 
and slid back the door. The other 
copter was fanning air above them 
and dropphig fast when Simon 
jumped. 

His left leg struck the side of a 
parked cab and threw' him off 
balance. He landed on his shoulder, 
rolled over and scrambled to his 
feet. He darted between the rows 
of copters, thankful for the partial 



26 





protection their blades ofTcred him. 
A paraheam zipped down at the 
long shadow he cast in the late 
afternoon sun, but in another mo- 
ment he had reached the roof en- 
trance to the Marriage Building 
and flung himself inside. 

Breathing hard, lie smoothed his 
rumpled clothing with shaking 
hands. That had been entirely too 
close. They thought he was fleeing 
becau.se he did not want to work 
for a living. Rot. If he were ever 
captured, all the romance would go 
from his life. 

He sauntered down the long, 
pleasant corridor lined with murals 
of domestic tranquility — family 
gathered around the dining table. 



Illustrated by Ed Emsh 

father and son raking leaves in the 
front yard, graceful elderly couple 
entertaining children and grand- 
children at a merry hearth, young 
husband and wife going to bed. 
He was in no hurry now, for the 
Marriage Building was legal sanc- 
tuary. 

He passed the long lines of re- 
gistering Quickies, men filing into 
one room, women into another. 
He let his glance rove the line of 
female Quickies, wondering if his 
new wife would come from this 
group. They ranged in age from 
eighteen to about sixty, he guessed, 
and naturally they were of all con- 
ceivable types. He caught himself 
in time and stopped looking. It 



27 




was not considered proper eti- 
quette. 

Rounding a turn in the corridor, 
Simon took the slidestair down one 
level to where Transients registered 
and attached himself to the end of 
a long line of men which was swal- 
lowed slowly by a doorway above 
which was the legend : 

MARRIAGE COUNSELORS 

Simon checked his counterfeit 
registration papers and was aware 
of the old, familiar feeling of un- 
certainty. His heart bobbed up into 
his throat and pounded there. His 
palms were clammy, his fingers 
wouldn’t keep still. VV'ould the 
papers pass inspection? He was al- 
most certain they would. But he 
savored the other possibility al- 
though he hated its ultimate con- 
sequences. As some people craved 
security, so others thrived on ad- 
venture. 

Simon lit a cigarct and waited 
while the line crawled forward, 
parallelling a line of female Tran- 
sients moving through another 
doorway. 

“Sit down, Mr. Grover,” the 
Counselor said as Simon entered 
the room. It was a large place with 
a central aisle and a dozen private 
cubbies on cither side, each one 
with celotex walls, a desk, two 
chairs, the latest in marriage lit- 
erature, and a Counselor. 

Simon cased his small frame into 
a comfortable chair and handed 
his papers to the Counselor. “I see 
you have come from Philadelphia,” 
the man said, smiling not quite 
professionally — which, Simon knew, 
was the best of all profes- 
sional smiles. “Were the accom- 



modations .satisfactory? Of course, 
you don’t have to talk about them.” 
“They were fine. Just fine.” 
Naturally, Simon did not tell the 
Counselor about his flight from the 
police. 

“How long will you be with us in 
New York?” 

“I figure about three weeks. It 
depends on business, though. Might 
be a little longer, I guess.” 

“We’ll say three weeks.” The 
Counselor .scrawled something on 
.Simon’s registration form. “Now, 
Mr. Grover, exactly what kind of 
wife arc you looking for?” 

“To tell you the truth, I haven’t 
given it much thought yet.” 

“Splendid,” the Counselor was 
delighted with the opportunity to 
expound on his wares. “.As you 
know, we have six basic types.” He 
removed six colorful folders from 
six stacks on his desk and handed 
them to Simon. 

“The first,” he went on, “is the 
newlywed Quickie. The red folder, 
Mr. Grover. She has just com- 
pleted her honeymoon, is not 
pregnant, and has been married 
for no more than six months.” 
Simon examined the folder. On 
the cover was pictured a young 
man carrying his bride, complete 
with bashful smile, across the thre.s- 
hold of their home. There were 
suggestive dining room, patio and 
bedroom scenes inside, with ap- 
propriate captions. 

“The second type,” explained 
the Counselor, “is the new moth- 
er.” The folder showed a charming 
young woman Ineast-feeding an 
infant. The Counselor went on to 
the other types: the middle mother, 
a woman of about thirty -with two 
children, one of pre-school age and

one in the first three grades; the 
teener, with from two to five child- 
ren in their teens or early twenties; 
the pre-gram, with any number 
of married children living away 
from home, but no grandchildren; 
and the grandmother. 

“You understand,” the Coun- 
selor said, “we have all typ>es in 
between as well. These are merely 
the basics.” He surveyed Simon’s 
registration papers again. “You’re 
thirty-five, Mr. Grover. A fine age, 
I might say. You’d be suited to any 
type, with the exception of the 
grandmother.” 

“I don’t want the grandmother, 
anyway,” Simon told him. “You 
know, I think I’ll take the newly- 
wed this time.” 

The Counselor winked know- 
ingly. “Still a lot of get-up-and-go 
in the old copter, eh?” 

“It’s spring,” Simon said. 

“Yes. We find it most interesting, 
that certain types are favored in 
the various seasons. Newlyweds in 
the spring, pre-grams in the sum- 
mer, middle mothers in the fall, 
new mothers and grandmothers in 
the winter. Confidentially, Mr. 
Grover, I’ve always longed to be a 
Transient myself. But you have to 
be a Quickie to hold this job, since 
you’re in one place for such a long 
period of time. Well, what type of 
newlywed did you have in mind?” 

Simon licked his lips eagerly. In 
Philadelphia the last time he had 
come close to learning the parting 
ritual. But it tripped him up, as 
usual, and he reached New York 
one step ahead of tlie police. “She 
must be very impressionable,” Si- 
mon said, “and very talkative. She 
must be eager to discuss the theories 
of multiple marriage — ” 

QUICKIE 



“Most newlyweds are,” the 
Counselor pointed out. 

“Well, particularly so. And, of 
course, she must not be carrying 
a torch for her honeymoon hus- 
band." 

“That’s rare these days, Mr. 
Grover.” 

“It happened to me once, in St. 
Louis. Had an awful time.” 

“Then she probably was a mis- 
fit. After all, the institution of mul- 
tiple marriages is almost eighty 
years old, and the only form of mar- 
riage in the United States today. 
If we were still in the early pioneer- 
ing days you might have cause to 
worry. Ideas of propinquity still 
seemed important then, and people 
were concerned with such things as 
lasting relationships, though for 
the life of me I can’t see why.” 

“They thought it was more se- 
cure,” suggested Simon. 

“But it isn’t. In the old days, 
statistics proved that if a man or 
woman was saddled with one 
mate too long, it often led to 
trouble. The old Et al report of 
1979 shocked the world with its 
figures: ninety five percent of all 
married men had illicit relations 
with other women, and the figure 
was almost as high for women. Re- 
lations with unmarried people. It’s 
rather horrible, isn’t it, Mr. 
Grover?” 

“I suppose so,” said Simon, half- 
listening. All he needed now was 
the parting ritual. A nice, impres- 
sionable, talkative newlywed girl 

As usual,” the Counselor con- 
tinued in a dedicated voice, “man 
had leaped ahead of his outmoded 
institutions without realizing it. 

29 



i 




The notion of marriage based lar- 
gely on propinquity and permanent 
relationship just didn’t fit the mod- 
ern tempo of civilization, where 
transient workers dart across the 
continent constantly, always on the 
move, hardly staying in one place 
long enough to hang their hats, as 
the expression goes. Marital infi- 
delity in the old days led to crimes 
of passion, to divorce, to unsettled 
families, to children reared in or- 
phanages or by strangers — perfect 
strangers, mind you — to divorce 
and re-marriages and so much 
energy and time and money wasted 
on second and even third court- 
ships. 

“Fortunately, the social institu- 
tion fits the tempo of the culture 
today. A Transient — man or wom- 
an — gets married and provides for 
one spouse, one family, but has the 
pick of the nation to choose from. 
Even a Quickie like myself is stim- 
ulated by constant variety and 
change. No one is ever bored. You 
don’t have to see your original 
mate ever again, as long as you, 
as a Transient, provide for her. 
The Quickies, in their turn, will 
provide for you in all your sub- 
sequent marriages. You have the 
novelty and sati.sfaction of a true 
change in environment every time 
you travel, but you also have the 
comfort and .security of a home.’’ 

“This newlywed girl must also 
be naive,” said Simon. “That’s 
important.” 

The Counselor made another no- 
tation. “You know,” he said, “there 
is one small school of thought 
which claims the novelty, the verve 
and sparkle aie lacking because the 
constant variation is perfectly legal. 
Perhaps they have a point there; 

30 



secrecy is stimulating. But they re- 
fuse to admit we even provide for 
that. After all, a Transient assumes 
the name of his temporary spouse, 
his Quickie. No one, not even the 
Quickie, know's his real identity. 
The Marriage records are avail- 
able to no one, not even the gov- 
ernment, not even the police, thus 
preseiving the .sense of — well, fresh- 
ne.ss for the Transients. 

“But I digress. Have you any 
physical preferences, Mr. Grover?” 

“I’m not very tall. Keep her 
down to my size, please. And I 
want a pretty wife.” 

The Counselor made his final 
notations, rolled Simon’s registra- 
tion papers and stuffed them into 
a pneumotube which he dropp>cd 
into a wall slot. The tube, Simon 
knew, was being whisked to Quickie 
Records, Newlywed Division, where 
identification of the girl fitting his 
requirements would Ire made by the 
machine records unit of available 
newlyweds. Last time, in Philadel- 
phia, he had selected a garrulous 
old grandmother and hated every 
moment of the two weeks he had 
spent with her. It had been against 
the recommendations of the Coun- 
selor there, who had claimed the 
age difference would not make for 
harmony. The man had been right, 
but worse yet, the old hag had been 
too wily to reveal what Simon had 
to know. 

“Congress is considering a law,” 
said the Counselor as they waited 
for the return of Simon’s registra- 
tion papers, “which would permit 
Quickies and Transients to alter- 
nate year after year. It would cause 
social upheaval at the beginning, 
but it’s only fair to us Quickies, 
don’t you think?” 

MILTON LESSER 



Simon shrugged. The man was 
starting to bother him. “I’d rather 
be a Transient,” he said. “I’m for 
the status quo.” 

“But Quickies have no choice in 
the matter, don’t you see? We have 
to marry whoever comes along. My 
last wife — ” 

“As a Quickie, you’re not sup- 
posed to talk about her.” 

The Counselor blanched at what 
had almost amounted to a sin. 
“Thank you,” he said, and waited 
in silence for the pneumotube. 

Finally, it came, popping out of 
the wall slot and alighting on the 
desk. The Counselor removed 
Simon’s papers and unrolled them, 
revealing a set of similar papers 
rolled tightly within. These he 
opened and spread on the desk, 
beckoning Simon to come around 
behind him and take a look. 

The first thing Simon saw was 
the snapshot, in the latest trivision 
process. The girl looked pretty 
enough, with a pale, heart-shaped 
face set off against short-cropped, 
shining black hair. She had enor- 
mous, child-like eyes. 

“How do you do?” the picture 
said. “I am Jane-Marie Paige. I 
miss you.” 

“See,” said the Counselor, “she 
has a lovely voice.” 

Simon nodded, picked up the 
trivision snapshot and held it under 
his nose, sniffing delicately. He 
liked the scent of Jane-Marie’s per- 
fume — not too musky, not too flow- 
ery, but that ideal compromise 
which indicated she would be nei- 
ther too sultry nor too fragile. 

The Counselor wrote in Simon’s 
name on her pajjers, printing “ap- 
prox. 3 wks” under the column for 
time, and handed both rolls to 

QUICKIE 



Simon. “Her address is in the sec- 
ond column,” he said. “Visit us 
again on your next trip to New 
York, Mr. Grover. And good luck.” 

B y the time Simon took the 
tubeway out to the suburban 
Long Island community in which 
Jane-Marie Paige lived, the bright 
spring afternoon was fading into 
dusk, tinting the western sky with 
bands of color ranging from deep 
blue and purple through mauve to 
delicate, dusty pink. The smell of 
spring was in the air, but with the 
coming of night the lingering chill 
of winter was still apparent. It 
would be great, coming home again 
to a new wife, to a drink and an 
excellent home-cooked dinner, to a 
cozy fire perhaps — especially when 
you could have all that and still re- 
tain the pulse-quickening feeling 
of adventure. 

Whistling, Simon found Maple 
Lane and walked by the rows of 
spherical houses which could ro- 
tate with the sun from equinox to 
solstice and back again. Simon 
could tell it was a development of 
newlywed homes by their small 
size, by the absence of baby car- 
riages and toys on the front lawns, 
by the small clumps of white birch 
trees and windows with their cur- 
tains drawn. 

He found the address listed on 
Jane-Marie’s registration papers 
and turned up the walk, noticing 
the small, ranch-type name j)ost 
with “Mr. and Mrs. Jane-Marie 
Paige” on it in big gold letters. 

“It’s Simon,” he said as the door 
slid soundlessly into the curving 
wall. “I’m home.” 

Suddenly, Jane-Marie appeared 

31 



there in tlie doorway. She must 
have been at one of the curtained 
windows, peeking out at him. There 
were soft lights behind her and a 
delicate halo circled her dark hair 
from the raditiara she wore. 

“Simon,” she said, barely above 
a whisper, a radiant smile on her 
face. “They called me. Come in, 
darling.” 

But she still barred the doorway. 
When he came in he came into the 
arms of his waiting wife, his newly- 
wed wife, his Jane-Marie. “I missed 
you ever since they sent your pic- 
ture,” she breathed, while he kissed 
the lobes of her ears, the tip of her 
nose, her eyes, her warm, eager 
lips. 

“Jane-Marie,” he said. It was 
genuinely thrilling to her, he 
sensed. It was more than that to 
him. It wa.s — it was illicitly thrill- 
ing, worth all the quick exits and 
close calls with the police. 

“You’ll muss me,” Jane-Marie 
scolded him, drawing away and re- 
arranging her hair under the tiara. 
“There. Are you hungry?” 

“Honey, I’m famished.” 

“Well, I’m making no promises. 
I’m not much of a cook, really. 
They didn’t tell me how long you 
were going to stay, but I should 
improve enough so when the 
next — ” 

“Sh. I’ll be here three weeks.” 

“Come in, come in.” She took 
his hand in her own warm one, 
pressing the door button and dim- 
ming the hall light as they walked 
into the house. “Tell me about 
yourself, darling. What do you do? 
How are you going to spend your 
time in New York? Oh, I’m so ex- 
cited. There’s so much to talk 
about, so much to learn about each 

32 



other. Do you play bridge? There’s 
a couple down the street, the wife’s 
a Transient and just got here to- 
day, but I know the husband, who 
likes to play bridge. Do you like 
music? I’ll turn some on.” 

She was talkative, all right. Soon 
Simon heard the lilting strains of a 
Strauss waltz. Jane-Marie pirouet- 
ted happily about the dining room 
table in three-quarter time and sat 
down, motioning Simon to sit near 
her and not on the other side. As 
he adjusted his napkin she leaned 
her head on his shoulder and said, 
“I like your eyes, darling.” 

He smiled. “They’re close-set.” 
“They are not. They’re very in- 
telligent-looking. I’ll bet you’re an 
engineer or something. I’ll bet 
you’re going to help design that 
new construction project in Brook- 
lyn. Gee, I like your eyes.” She 
gazed up at them demurely. 

The robot server wheeled in the 
first course along with a frosted 
bottle of champagne leaning grace- 
fully in a silver chilling urn. Simon 
popped the cork expertly, filled 
both glasses and raised his. “To us,” 
he said. 

“To us, darling. Forever and ever 
three weeks. 1 hope you like 
chopped liver salad,” Jane-Marie 
added nervously. “I had no way of 
knowing, but from now on you’ll 
get whatever you like, I promise.” 
“It’s delicious,” Simon said, be- 
ginning to eat. 

Other courses followed. There 
was jellied consomm6, roast, stuffed 
chicken and sweet potato pudding, 
a salad which Simon tossed with 
an enthusiasm and expertness that 
Jane-Marie said was a joy to be- 
hold, dessert of brandied bing cher- 

MILTON LESSER 




rles, coffee and pie. And a constant 
stream of chatter from Jane-Marie. 

“Well,” said Simon, patting die 
bulge at his waistline and sliding 
his belt-clasp an inch or two looser 
with the comfortable informality 
only a married man can display 
(and in his own home, thought 
Simon). “I must say that was 
good.” 

“I’m so glad you liked it. Do 
you want to sit around the fire and 
talk, dear?” She flavored the term 
of endearment once more. “Dear.” 

The robot server had begun to 
remove the dishes from the table. 
Simon stood up and was followed 
by Jane-Marie into the sunken liv- 
ing room, where he began to pile 
wood and kindling on the andirons 
in the raised-hearth fireplace. As 
she bent to watch him, the decollete 
hostess gown revealed a breathless 
amount of lovely white skin. “May- 
be we’ll retire after that,” Simon 
said, trying not to sound the way he 
felt, which was more than mildly 
lecherous. 

Jane-Marie smiled a secret, 
small-girl smile and pulled him 
down on the cushion in front of the 
hearth, on which a bright fire was 
now crackling. “It’s so good to 
have you home, darling, all to my- 
self. Will your work keep you away 
much? I hope not.” 

“To tell you the truth, I’m on 
vacation.” 

“That is nice,” Jane-Marie mur- 
mured dreamily. “And flattering, 
too, because you selected me to 
share your vacation.” 

“Could it be anyone but you?” 
Simon said. “As if it could be any- 
one but you.” Which was perfectly, 
beautifully, delightfully true — for 
three weeks. “You married rather 

QUICKIE 



young, I see.” 

Jane-Marie stroked his temples 
witli long fingers. “Oh, now, don’t 
be so sure,” she smiled. “Maybe 
I’m older than I look.” 

“No. You’re about twenty. I 
guess you like marriage.” 

“I love it. It’s too early to tell, 
but — well, it agrees with me.” 

“I’m glad.” 

“Glad of what, darling?” 

“That you married early. Come 
here.” 

She came and sat in his lap. He 
blew in her ears and at the short 
hairs on the nape of her neck until 
she laughed. “I love you,” she said. 
“I love you so.” 

He loved her too. It was right. 
She was the girl he had selected. 
But a sense of urgency swept over 
him, not only for the love they 
would consummate as the night 
grew longer, but for what he hoped 
to learn from her so he could have 
the name as well as the game- — as 
well as that feeling of adventure 
which sharpened his senses so 
acutely. He said, “Do you ever 
think of the times before multiple 
marriage became the accepted so- 
cial institution? Do you ever think 
of how those people must have 
felt?” 

“I knew you were an intellec- 
tual!” Jane-Marie cried instead of 
answering his question. “I just 
knew it. I could see it in your eyes, 
darling. Oh, I do love you.” 

He kissed her tenderly, then with 
fire. He could feel the passion 
mounting between them, but tore 
himself from its grasp. “Don’t you 
ever think of it?” he asked again. 

“Well, I read a book about it 
once, Murray’s The Decline of 
Monogamy. They must have felt 

33 




simply awful, darling. I mean, I 
love you, but to have to spend all 
that time, season after season, year 
after year, svith the same person 
would — would drive you crazy. 
You’d get to know him so well, 
everything he did, the way he 
thought and all. Oh, with you it’s 
different. I could spend forever 
with you three weeks, but — ” 

“No, Honey. I mean the others. 
The outcasts. Those who carried on 
adulterous relationships.’’ 

Jane-Marie frowned in thought. 
He could tell the conversation in- 
terested her but thought she would 
have preferred to drop it. Still, the 
conversation was flowing more 
smoothly than he had dared hope, 
and in the right direction. 

“I don’t know,” Jane-Marie 
finally admitted. “I suppose they 
were pioneers, sort of. I mean, 
flaunting social custom the way 
they did because they were willing 
to fight for a better way of life.” 

“I agree with you,” Simon said. 
“Sometimes convention restricts 
you and doc.sn’t allow you to live 
the fullest life. You should then 
flaunt convention by all means, 
don’t you think?” 

“I do. I do.” 

He sighed gratefully. The seed 
had been planted. He now had to 
cultivate it for three weeks. A word 
here, a gesture there, a suggestion, 
twenty-one days of marital bliss, of 
gaining her confidence, of impress- 
ing her with everything he did. 

“Well,” he said, “shall we go up- 
stairs?” 

He watched the color rise from 
Jane-Marie’s throat and soon .suf- 
fuse her face. “I was thinking Mr. 
and Mrs. Busby might want to play 
some bridge — ” 

34 



“There are other nights,” he 
said. He scattered the embers of 
the burning logs with the poker 
and went into the dining room 
after the bottle of champagne. 
With Jane-Marie at his side he 
climbed the stairs. 



T he shower had stopped. 

He could hear Jane-Marie hum- 
ming to herself in a nervous falset- 
to. He didn’t know whether to get 
under the covers or not, and final- 
ly decided Jane-Marie would be 
more at ease if he did. He had al- 
ready combed his hair and brushed 
his teeth. 

At last, she came. She was love- 
ly, his wife, in a daring black negli- 
gee. She stood there in it for a long, 
wonderful moment, then plunged 
the room into darkness. 

You could be a newlywed over 
and o\-er again, Simon thought 
happily. You could taste the joys 
of brand new parenthood not once 
but a hundred times. You could see 
the kids off to school on that mem- 
orable first day as often as you 
liked, see your grandchildren that 
first glorious time through the glass 
window also as often as you wi.shed, 
or taste many times of an old, es- 
tablished relationship which was 
yet mysteriously new, despite the 
gray hairs and conditioned fa- 
miliarity. 

It was a full life, but something 
was lacking. Did it make him a 
misfit? Probably, but he had his 
own life to lead, his own fulfill- 
ment to achieve, his own strange 
kinship with the early rebels who 
had blasted monogamy from the 
pages of social history. 

“You’ll think this is silly,” Jane- 

MILTON LESSER 



Marie whispered in the darkness. 

“What’s that, dear? What will I 
think is silly?” 

“What I’m going to ask you.” 

“No I won’t. Honest.” 

“Well—” 

“Go on, if it will make you hap- 
py.” He could sense her presence 
near him. 

“Well, it isn’t that I don’t trust 
you, but there’s so much of it going 
on lately that I thought — ” 

“What did you think?” 

“The — the parting ritual. You 
know what it’s for, darling. A safe- 
guard.” 

Simon plunged from zenith to 
nadir in seconds. He would never 
spend those three weeks with Jane- 
Marie. He would be running again, 
running until he could board the 
tubeways in anonymity from the 
basement of a Marriage Building 
in some other city. But it had never 
happened so quickly before. 

“Can’t it wait for three weeks?” 
he asked, knowing the request was 
futile. 

“Then it’s hardly a safeguard for 
me, just for— for the next one. It’s 
just lately that all those misfits have 
Started ... I guess some people 
will never be satisfied.” 

Her hand touched his hand in 
darkness. There were finger move- 
ments. She began to chant mean- 
ingless syllables. 

This was it, Simon knew in de- 
spair. He could not respond. It was 
a simple thing, but people were 
sworn to absolute secrecy. It was 
changed every few months and he 
had never been able to learn it. 

A sob escaped Jane- Marie’s lips. 
Simon,” she gasped. “Simon, you 
aren’t . you’re not doing . 



“No,” he said wearily. He sat up 
quickly in the darkness, and dressed. 
He could hear her reaching for the 
phone. He stood up and went to 
her, but she turned away. 

“Don’t you touch me. Go away, 
leave me alone. Of all the despica- 
ble . and I thought ... I almost 
. Hello, police? This is Mrs. 
Jane-Marie Paige on Maple Lane. 
I want to report. .” 

“Goodbye,” he whispered softly. 

“I hate you!” 

He left quickly, double-timing 
down Maple Lane between the 
rows of spherical houses. He didn’t 
belong. He was an outlaw, a crim- 
inal, a maladjusted misfit — or 
worse. Some people are never satis- 
fied. The police failed to under- 
stand. To them his type was lazy, 
shiftless. They were drones, para- 
sites who could reap all the advan- 
tages of multiple life without work- 
ing a day. They had no one to sup- 
port. 

But that isn’t it at all, thought 
Simon as he ran. He could hear the 
approaching wail of police sirens. 
He must hurry. Perhaps in Boston 
he would get the one stroke of luck 
he needed, if the police didn’t 
catch him first. It wasn’t that he 
was lazy and lacked the sense of 
responsibility which would make 
him support a family. Everything 
was too patterned, too set-out-for- 
you, too prosaic. In his own way he 
courted danger and was hated for 
it. He sought the spice of an illicit 
relationship which he supposed 
some people always needed. 

He could picture pretty Jane- 
Marie crying out the whole story 
to the police. “That man — he was 
a bachelor!” • .

Money Is the Root of All Good 



Urgent! Class A A emergency for Universal Relief! Stock 
market crash on planet Lyrane, where people live

galactical manipulators of watering stock.

K ALGOR, capital of the Galac- 
tic Empire, is not, as one would 
cxfDcct, one solid city. As a matter 
of fact, it is more surburban and 
rural than many farming planets. 

The reason is obvious if but 
considered. The galactic govern- 
ment and the equally large galac- 
tic businesses arc so immense that 
they must he distributed through- 
out the whole galaxy, with only the 
very cream of the hierarchy located 
on Kalgor. Thus, each company 
would have only one small build- 
ing — but with a communication 
web that enfolded macroscopic en- 
terprises. 

Universal Relief Incorporated 

37 



was typical of this arrangement. 
Although its warehouses and of- 
fices throughout the Empire could 
form a megalopolis in themselves, 
the fountainhead on Kalgor was a 
two story building. 

In that building there was ex- 
citement. People were rushing 
frantically — the teletypes chattered 
in a frenzy — the air was static with 
urgency. It manifested itself in the 
quick jerky motions, in the voices 
held just below the cracking point. 

Universal Relief scived the 
function that used to be handled 
by the Red Cross. They were disas- 
ter rectifiers, succor and reconstruc- 
tion was their business. But they 



were a business — declaring annual, 
taxable profits and dividends and, 
in general, a profit-seeking firm. 

They received regular payments 
from planetary governments, much 
like premiums with insurance, and 
in case of emergency they were to 
provide complete relief as swiftly 
as possible. There was no chance 
for graft in their business, for they 
were closely checked by the govern- 
ment and competing organizations 
like Galactic Aid, their closest rival. 

This business was now ap- 
parently faced with a crisis and its 
staff was feverishly trying to cope 
with it. 

Roald Gibbons, President of 
Universal Relief, was the only 
person not affected — at least not 
apparently. His indolent posture, 
his quiet grey eyes reflected noth- 
ing of the hectic activity. 

This made Kim Roger ners’ous. 

“I don’t think you comprehend 
the seriousness of it, Mr. Gibbons,” 
he was saying. 

“I am not thinking of the serious- 
ness of it. I just want the facts.” 

“Very well, sir. Two days ago, 
the Lyranian stock market 
crashed.” 

“You will have to go back fur- 
ther than that. I can’t possibly know 
the history of all the planets in the 
Empire. That’s what I pay you for. 
Give me some background.” 

This little speech made Kim lose 
his clutching hold on his patience. 
Roald Gibbons had just taken of- 
fice after the death of his father, 
who had managed the galactic 
firm for twenty years. By merely 
being the boss’s son, Roald had 
achieved the reputation of being 
an ignorant, careless playboy. His 
professed ignorance of the planets 

38 



confirmed, in Kim’s mind, this rep- 
utation. 

With an effort, Kim resumed. 
“The planet of Lyrane, the only 
habitable one in the system of Ly- 
rane — Copernicus sector — was col- 
onized by a socio-economic sect for 
the purpose of testing its slightly 
radical beliefs. 

“This sect maintained that an 
individual should not be paid on 
the basis of the work he did, but 
for the good deeds, or good 
thoughts he had. A small stipend 
was paid for actual work or pro- 
duction, to establish a workable 
basic economy and trade. This 
stipend was enough to cover all 
the basic wants of the individual. 

“To procure luxuries, a citizen 
had to use the money he received 
for his good deeds or thoughts. 
Every time a man helped an old 
lady across the street, or came up 
with a bit of philosophical wisdom, 
he could record it with a central 
office and receive his luxury pay 
from the government. 

“The purpose of the system was 
to make people emphasize virtue 
and quality in their lives. Instead 
of concentrating on profit for 
profit’s sake, they would hav'c to 
consider the inherent rightness and 
beauty of what they were doing.” 

“In such a system,” Roald asked, 
“how could such a thing as a stock 
market possibly develop?” 

“Very simple, .sir. This luxury 
pay, issued in a different currenev 
than the commodity pay, could 
be used in any way a person saw 
fit. Some people naturally devel- 
oped the idea of investing stock in 
a particularly virtuous or intelli- 
gent person. Every time that person 
ffid a good deed, the stockholders 

PATRICK WILKINS 




received a dividend from his lux- 
ury pay. All of the scientists and 
philosophers, therefore, became 
corporations in themselves, with as 
many as five thousand people hold- 
ing stock in one man.” 

“Sorr>', Kim, but I don’t get it. 
How' could these incorporated in- 
dividuals get any luxuiy pay for 
themselves if they had to hand it 
out to their stockholders?” 

“The administration w-ould al- 
low for that. A person received lux- 
ury pay in proportion to the num- 
ber of stockholders that he claimed. 
The government had to do this 
since they indirectly were invest- 
ing in these corporation men — but 
I’ll explain that later. 

“The corporation-man lived off 
the original investments of stock- 
holders, with some of the stock 
solvent for sales. In this way, the 
individual would profit from “good- 
doing” by receiving many new in- 
vestments.” 

“What is the social makeup of 
this Lyrane? It seems to me it 
would be a lunatic fringe de luxe, 
with every hack writer, thauma- 
turgist, or evangelist climbing 
aboard the gravy train.” 

“On the contrary, it is a social 
structure of the finest minds in the 
galaxy. The rest are all weeded 
out. Although the motives of the 
system are idealistic, they are en- 
forced witli a rigid practicality. 
They demand quality and truth, 
and gauge it with the revealing 
yardstick of public consumption 
and approval as measured in sales 
and polls.” 

Roald gazed out at the pastoral 
countryside surrounding tliis vital 
little nub of a billion-credit busi- 
ness. He swung back to Kim, and 



said, “But the basic difficulty would 
be determining ju.st what a good 
deed or thought is. How in God’s 
name could they determine that, 
when every' act or word that any- 
one ever commits or utters is open 
to judgment by so many different 
standards. For instance, what about 
the case of the man w'ho tres- 
passes to save a person’s life. How 
are you going to rate diat sort of 
thing?” 

“Mr. Gibbons, I am an econo- 
mist, not a philosopher. It is the 
wonder of the gala.xy that these 
people did establish and maintain 
tills system, in spite of obstacles 
such as you mentioned.” 

“All right, we’ll discount the 
philosophical angle. I still don’t 
understand it. How about big busi- 
ness? How could that develop with 
this system? They certainly need it 
to support a planet.” 

“That’s the easiest part of it. 
People would use their luxury pay 
to establish businesses. At these 
businesses men could work their 
five hours a day to get their com- 
modity pay. It was not only pos- 
sible, but mandatory that such 
businesses develop. There were two 
types: mass production of com- 
modities, with a regulated profit 
in commodity pay; or specializa- 
tion and production of fine mer- 
chandise that was sold at cost, but 
whicli die government paid for in 
luxury pay in proportion to its 
quality as thoroughly tested. 

“However — all big businesses 
were closely controlled by the gov- 
ernment. They would grant fran- 
chises so that there would be no 
cutthroat competition, and supply 
was regulated to meet demand. 
Therefore, business itself was stable, 

39 



MONEY IS THE ROOT OF ALL GOOD 




and there was'no opportunity for 
speculating in its stock market. 
That left only the variable cor- 
poration-men for actual stock 
market trading — and that is what 
crashed. 

“Let’s take a writer, for example. 
He writes a book, and a publish- 
ing house prints it. The people 
buy it — spending luxury pay. The 
publishing house has to convert 
that luxury pay to commodity pay 
to cover costs and payroll. They 
make no profit, the book being 
sold at cost. 

“That book has to sell so many 
thousand copies to receive luxury 
pay from the government. Then 
both the author and the publisher 
receive luxury pay in proportion 
to its sales, which is the indication 
of its merit. The luxury pay that 
the publisher receives goes in the 
pockets of the executives. The lux- 
ury pay that the author receives — 
which is much larger — goes to his 
stockholders. 

“Since the author is the source 
of this transaction, the people in- 
vest in him and not the publisher, 
for they can’t get any great return 
from investing in the publisher, but 
they can from the author. 

“Actually, what the whole thing 
amounts to is a complete shift of 
emphasis from big business and its 
.speculations — which is what we’ve 
always known — to individuals and 
the intangibles and variables of 
their ideas and deeds.” 

• “There is only one question left,” 
Roald said. “The government doles 
out all this luxury pay. Pray tell, 
where do they get it?” 

“There arc two parts to the gov- 
ernment. There is the actual ad- 
ministration, with its members 

40 



drawing set salaries and unable to 
draw luxury pay, to prevent graft; 
and then there is the Economics 
Commission, which controls luxury 

p^y- 

“This Economics Commission is 
a business. They invest in galactic 
corptorations, such as ours, and 
make a profit. That’s part of their 
money. Then — and here’s the se- 
cret — any time a book is written, 
or fine merchandise produced, it 
must be sold on Lyrane at cost. 
But the government sells it through- 
out the galaxy for a profit, and 
keeps that profit to redistribute in 
luxury pay to Lyranian citizens. 

“Anyway, the system finally blew 
up, and now we’re holding a messy 
bag.” 

“But how could it? Why?” 

“That’s just it. Nobody knows 
what brought it about, but sud- 
denly the men who were corpora- 
tions just stopped producing. They 
stopped doing good deeds, stopped 
writing, stopped research, and 
what-not and, consequently, 
stopped drawing luxury pay. 

“Naturally, their stockholders got 
mad and wanted to sell, but in- 
corporated men couldn’t liquidate 
and the values of the stocks 
dropjjed to zero, along with the 
value of the luxury pay. The result 
was a depression and a lot of angry 
people.” 

“A planetary depression is not 
such an outstanding emergency that 
it should cause Universal Relief to 
be in such an uproar. I believe that 
it is merely a Class B emergency, 
with complete regulations on prop- 
er handling.” 

Kim was so earnest in his reply 
that he leaned over and almost 
rubbed noses with his superior. 

PATRICK WILKINS 




“On the contrary, sir. There are 
other factors, so its not so simple. 
This Lyranian system has been 
working for ten years now, and the 
Lyranians want desperately for it 
to succeed. They are almost fanatics 
on it, trying to prove the value of 
their .system .so that other planets 
will adopt it — which God forbid. 

“Naturally, the resentment 
against the corporation-mcn for 
betraying them has turned into 
hatred, with murder, riots and a 
civil war in the offing. Yes, their 
politics were unitary and stable 
until this emergency, but you’d be 
surprised at the number of polit- 
ical factions that can be formed 
and develop hostilities in a period 
of crisis.” 

“Could it be an attempt by some 
faction to seize power?” 

“Impossible. The way it was set 
up, political power was not desir- 
able, being unprofitable and mostly 
drudgery'. If they upset the apple- 
cart, the balance was so fine only 
chaos would result and there would 
be nothing to take power over. The 
only reason parties have developed 
now is due to differing views on 
how to rectify the situation, and 
blaming different things for being 
responsible. But no power motive.” 

“Very well then, the situation is 
a Class A emergency, but we’ve 
handled them before.” 

Kim allowed one fleeting sigh of 
despair. He had thought for a 
while that this Roald could take 
hold, could be competent, but — 

“If you have ever consulted our 
financial records, sir,” he said with 
heavy sarca.sm, “you would find 
that our largest contribution comes 
from Lyrane. They have estab- 
lished our organization as tops in 



the good-deeds field, and nearly 
every person on Lyrane has stock 
in us, along with a sizable payment 
since we threw a high premium at 
them, fearing just this eventuality.” 
Roald appeared thoughtful, then 
said, “Well, continue with stand- 
ard procedures for a Class A 
emergency. I’ll .see what can be 
done.” 

Kim made one last desperate 
appeal. “I firmly believe that this 
should be a Class AA emergency!” 
“Your field of specialization is 
overriding your business sense, 
Kim. You arc fascinated, as an 
economist, by this Lyrane system, 
and you would like to see us put 
it back on its feet so you economists 
would have a live experiment to 
observe. I’m sorry, but it isn’t 
practical. You know how fantas- 
tically expensive a Class AA is, and 
no one planet is about to get it.” 
Kim cowered mentally. This 
wasn’t the indolent playboy, but 
the Old Man, giving him a good 
dressing down. He left the office 
with restored faith, but a faith that 
was interlaced with doubt in regard 
to Roald Gibbons. 

Roald appeared to Kim to be 
uninformed and incompetent ; but 
on the contrary, he had learned the 
business thoroughly from his father. 
There was one division of the 
company that he knew especially 
well. 

This division was known to only 
a few people in the company, and 
no one outside knew it existed. 
Roald managed this special divi- 
sion, and left the rest of the man- 
agement to the routine procedures 
and junior executives. 

while the rest of the company 
was in a state of organized hysteria, 

41 



MONEY IS THE ROOT OF ALL GOOD 




with great ships loading from the 
massive warehouses of food, medi- 
cine, and other relief supplies, and 
heaving into the sky bound for 
Lyrane, Roald was having a quiet 
conference with the members of his 
special division. 

Roald’s father had known that 
the cheapest way to relieve an 
emergency was to alleviate the 
causes behind it, unless it were a 
natural disaster. For this reason, 
he had organized a corps of special 
agents to penetrate behind the 
scenes to straighten out the causes 
and cut short the emergencies that 
Universal Relief had to pay for. 

“Apparently there is a definite 
force operating on Lyrane,” Roald 
was saying to his elite corp, “that 
caused these men, who had been 
living by the standards of that 
civilization and becoming rich from 
it, to cease the activity which they 
had profited by.” 

“Could it be a religious doc- 
trine?” one of them asked. 

“Possibly. It could be anything. 
The fact is wc don’t know — and 
we should. So we’re going to 
Lyrane. For the Main Office, this 
is a Class A; but for us it is a 
Class AA!” 



E ROL GARBIN sat on the cool 
stone terrace of the mountain 
lodge, gazing out over the small 
valley with the golden orange sun 
of Lyrane setting behind the moun- 
tains. The cool evening breeze 
gently rearranged his white hair 
and brushed over the creased fore- 
head and the worried eyes. 

He looked up to see his daughter 
come out on to the terrace. She 
was a comely young woman of 

42 



slight build and apparently sen- 
sitive nature as vivified in her 
piquant features. He gave her a 
wistful smile, at which she rushed 
into his arms and buried her head 
in his shoulder, which was still 
powerful despite his age. Her body 
quivered with muffled sobs. 

“Yma, my dearest Yma,” he said 
tenderly. “Why didn’t you marry, 
so that you would have none of 
this? You could be leading your 
own life, instead of bearing my 
burden.” 

“You are no burden, Father. 
You are my life. And now that 
your life is threatened — ” 

He knew what had upset her. He 
had heard the newscasts too — yes, 
the video still operated, controlled 
by the people. He had heard the 
names of his old friends— Fredrik- 
son, Tomlin, Masschau — all dead 
by violence. 

“Why do you keep silent?” his 
daughter asked with a little child’s 
pleading. “Where is the protection 
you were offered? Why don’t you 
tell the people?” The world was 
mad and destructive in the eyes of 
the child — the woman who was a 
child in the face of this dilemma. 

He gently quieted her with a 
large, steady hand that pressed her 
head to him. 

“It would do no good. Arnson 
tried it.” 

She looked up with hope in her 
eyes. 

“He spoke to a special meeting of 
his stockholders and tried to tell 
them. They scorned it as a wild 
fantasy to excuse his betrayal. They 
issued him an ultimatum- — work! 
He said that they would have to 
believe him ; he couldn’t work. 
They killed him.” 

PATRICK WILKINS 




The hope slid away and her eyes 
assumed the depths of despair and 
bitterness. 

Despair for the future, and bit- 
terness for the past. And she 
thought of the past — for she dared 
not think of the future. 

Where does violence start, she 
wondered. Trace it to its roots; 
what’s its source, what’s its mani- 
festation? 

It starts with one man and an 
idea. Many men may have had the 
same idea, but it takes one man 
to express it at the right time, to 
apply it. Then the planning, by 
many or by one. 

And, finally, the last step is 
persuasion. The man who had the 
original idea must convince others. 
He must indoctrinate them with 
this new concept so that they be- 
lieve. No more. 

For once a man, who has been 
a stable entity in a stable organiza- 
tion, develops and believes a 
strange and contradictory idea — 
the result is inevitable. Misunder- 
standing, resentment, hate, vio- 
lence. The cycle carries on from 
there with its own momentum. 

And the people who arc swept 
up in it, and that may include 
anyone from the most innocent to 
the perpetrator himself, are as 
helpless to control its outcome as 
are the atoms helpless to control 
the nova they started in a sun. 

So this violence on Lyrane had 
begun, with one man, then a group 
of men, and then had come the mis- 
understanding, resentment, hate, 
violence cycle. It manifested itself 
in the offices of Universal Relief 
as a logical study in sociology and 
economics. 

But to Yma Garbin and her 



father, it was pure hell. 

When had it all started, and 
when would it end? 

Did it start that first day when 
an orphanage in the capital city 
burned to the ground, and not one 
of the many philanthropists made 
a move or an offer to aid or re- 
store ? 

Yes, that was when it started for 
the public, but it had really started 
in midnight conversations in locked 
rooms. Words, an idea, then the 
act — and who is to say which is 
more real? 

But there was no questioning the 
reality of what she had seen at 
Tomlin’s house. That was yester- 
day. 

Tomlin, the greatest living bio- 
chemist in the empire, was nothing 
but a sad, huddled corpse. His 
beautiful mansion was slashed and 
looted, and then fired to the 
ground. The air was filled witli the 
odor of burning, of death — but 
especially the mentally sickening, 
defeating odor or violence. 

This was true of the whole 
planet, especially in the cities. The 
great houses beseiged by furious 
mobs, shattered. Night full of stray 
shots and casual death. Every man 
with that cold gleam in his eye 
when he looked at even his best 
friend. 

“Did you cause it?’’ 

Yma lay in her father’s arms, her 
mind reeling through this wax 
works of personal horror and death. 

This scene was interrupted by a 
gyro landing on the lawn. 

E ROL watched it curiously; 

his daughter, tensely. A man 
emerged and strode towards them. 

43 



MONEY IS THE ROOT OF ALL GOOD 




He was a young man, with good 
and intelligent features, and Erol 
felt no fear. 

“Dr. Garbin,” the man addressed 
him, “I’m delighted to find you. I 
tried to see others — I was always 
too late.’’ He paused, then said, 
“If anyone should 'be able to tell 
me what has happened, you 
should.’’ 

A slight suspicion showed in 
Erol’s face while Yma looked as 
wary as an animal. 

“If I can help you in any way, 
sir, I shall be delighted,’’ Erol said. 

The young man sat down. His 
eyes told of bewilderment and hor- 
ror, and Erol guessed that he had 
been in the cities. 

"My name is Florin Brite,” the 
man said after a long silence. “I 
was a student of Tomlin, the bio- 
chemist, who was, I believe, your 
friend. I left over a year ago to 
study at the Institute of Klynos. I 
heard of trouble here and grabbed 
the first ship home. 

“I never dreamed I’d find such 
violence. 

“When I tried to find out what 
happened, I only found that all 
the great men that I knew were 
murdered, or in hiding.” 

“How did you find where I 
was?” Erol asked. 

“I talked to one of Tomlin’s 
servants, an old fellow — scared 
silly — but he remembered me and 
he told me.” 

Erol seemed to accept this. 
“What do you want to know?” 

“Sir, I just want to know what 
happened. Why do the people 
feel they have been deceived, and 
by whom? Why are all the incor- 
porated men in danger of their 
lives?” 

44 



“It is the corporation men who’ 
have deceived the public.” It was 
a flat statement by Erol, without 
rancor or sympathy. “They are, in 
consequence, subject to the wrath 
of the people who relied upon 
them.” 

The bewilderment in the young 
man’s eyes deepened. “How could 
they deceive the public? Why? 
They had everything to gain from 
earning luxury pay for their stock- 
holders. Why did they stop?” 

As if at a signal, Erol relaxed 
and his weariness became evident. 
Yma relaxed somewhat but re- 
mained alert. 

“Why they did,” Erol replied, 
“is a private matter that only each 
of those men knows. The fact is 
that they, myself included, did — 
and now we must pay.” 

“You sir? But you were always 
such an eminent figure. I’ve ad- 
mired you from childhood as being 
one of the best of the planet’s many 
scientists. Your researches in so- 
ciology have led the empire. Why 
should you suddenly stop your 
writing?” 

“Fine flattery, son, but it will 
not avail you. I also see that you 
are not completely in the dark. 
You must have been investigating 
or you wouldn’t know that I have 
a half-finished book that never got 
to the publisher on time. 

“Anyway, the reasons are in- 
consequential, now. It is done, and 
we must consider the consequences. 
And we must consider you. What 
do you intend to do, return to Kly- 
nos, or stay here?” 

“You don’t get out of it that 
easily,” Florin said. “Yes, consider 
me. Consider me as a citizen of this 
planet, a believer in its principles. 

PATRICK W1LKIN5 




I am no idiot that can’t understand 
or won’t accept the truth. 

“You are a sociologist. Here we 
have one of the most paradoxical 
sociological situations imaginable 
on our planet. There obviously are 
many unknown factors. You know 
them — you must. Just consider me 
a student and explain the function- 
ings of these phenomena.” 

“You try my patience, Mr. Brite. 
I am accepting you at face value, 
but you are a stranger to me. What 
I wish to keep to myself is entirely 
my business. As I say, I am accept- 
ing you, and trying to help you — 
as we all must do in this mess. 
Now what do you intend to do?” 
With a fatalistic shrug, Florin 
replied, “I cannot go back to Kly- 
nos. My education was paid for by 
my stock in corporation-men here. 
That is now, as you know, worth- 
less.” 

Yma spoke to him for the first 
time. “Then don’t you feel resent- 
ment towards the men who — who 
betrayed you?” Her eyes awaited 
his answer. 

Florin smiled. “I do not feel that 
I have been betrayed. I know that 
the corporation-men, representing 
the most intelligent clement of 
Lyrane, wouldn’t do this thing 
without a sound reason.” 

Erol said, “Apparently you wish 
to throw in your lot with us, rather 
than the mob.” 

“My loyalty to my teacher and 
his associates compels me to do so. 
It is also my personal desire.” 

“You won’t get any luxury pay 
for that loyalty,” Yma snapped. 

“That’s unfair. You know Tom- 
lin always advocated proper living 
from a moral obligation rather than 
for mercenary reward.” 



Their conversation was inter- 
rupted by a faint humming. Out 
over the valley three gyros were 
approaching at a low altitude. 

Bitterly, Yma said, “Apparently 
Tomlin’s servant has talked to other 
people — or perhaps Mr. Brite 
here — .” 

Florin shrugged again. “I have 
no defense except to say that I 
talked to no one. Either you be- 
lieve me or you don’t.” 

Erol chimed in, “You’ll have to 
excuse my daughter; she’s upset. I 
expected them to discover me long 
before this. This abandoned hunt- 
ing lodge was too well known.” 

Yma’s mind jumped on that. 
Yes, she thought. How well it is 
known — to me. My childhood is 
stuffed full of memories of this 
place, all pleasant. 1 know the 
woods around here better than the 
streets of the city. Now it will be 
the scene of this furtive hiding, sus- 
pense, and God knows what new 
violence. 

While she was thinking, Erol was 
still talking. “I will ask you, since 
you are young and more adept in 
this sort of emergency. What shall 
we do?” 

Florin glanced at Yma, and saw 
that the bitterness had left her in 
the face of danger. She too looked 
anxiously to him for help. 

“If we stay here,” he said, “we 
will be killed without question. I 
have no doubt that those ships are 
part of the mob. Even if it is the 
police, and I doubt there are any 
left after the rioting, they will im- 
prison us.” 

Erol said, “This is a hunting 
lodge. There are some weapons 
here. We have nothing but your 
gyro to escape in, and it’s too slow. 

45 



MONEY IS THE ROOT OF ALL GOOD 




I can see that those are police 
gyros.” 

“Then we’ll fight,” Yma declared 
and rushed inside, with Florin and 
Erol following her. 

“This place is not much for de- 
fense,” Florin said while they rum- 
maged for rifles, fot nothing more 
deadly was allowed outside the 
hands of the Galactic Patrol. “I 
suggest we make it seem peaceful 
and surprise them.” 

“Good idea, boy,” Erol said. “If 
you want. I’ll sit outside as a de- 
coy.” 

“That’s great!” Florin said 
quickly, ignoring Yma’s protest. 
“If they see you, they will prob- 
ably land and talk; but if nobody’s 
in sight, they might bomb us.” 

The three worked well together, 
swiftly and efficiently. Erol sat on 
the veranda, in the open, with a 
pistol under a lap robe, while Yma 
and Florin stationed themselves in- 
side. 

The three gyros approached cau- 
tiously. They were the large black 
type used by the planetary police, 
but from the inexpert way they 
were handled all three at the lodge 
knew they were not bearing police. 
They carried bombs, the one weap- 
on allowable to planetary police by 
the Galactic Patrol, but the men 
in them would have nothing more 
than firearms. Therefore it was im- 
perative to get them on the ground. 

They circled over the lodge, with 
two finally landing and one remain- 
ing aloft. Florin padded over to 
Yma, and whispered for her to sta- 
tion herself in some bushes by the 
lodge. He told her to try to shoot 
down the gyro above when firing 
began. 

Men piled out of the ships which

had landed, and approached the 
lodge. They spread out and swiftly 
encircled the building. They all 
carried rifles. Florin estimated that 
there were about twenty of them. 
Three of them approached Erol. 
“Are you Erol Garbin?” 

“Yes. What can I do for you?” 
“We are arresting you.” 

“What for?” 

“For betraying the confidence of 
the people.” 

“May I see your warrant?” 

“We don’t need a warrant. We 
are a people’s committee, come to 
take you to a people’s court, where 
you will undoubtedly be found 
guilty and executed.” 

“And what if I refuse to recog- 
nize your authority?” 

“We will have to kill you. Resist- 
ing arrest — ” 

What happened next surprise 
Florin with its swiftness. Erol 
flipped the gun from under the 
robe and with three snap shots 
dropped all three men. 

Florin did not let surprise ham- 
per him, for Erol’s shots were 
echoed by his own rifle, which 
caught two men who were further 
away. 

As the rest of the attackers dove 
for cover, Florin was pleased to 
hear the blast of a rifle from the 
side of the lodge, and the whine of 
a shattered blade as the gyro plum- 
meted to the ground. 

Yma had done well, hitting 
where he told her, at the base of 
the props. The moment of victory 
was rudely shattered by a volley of 
fire from the men around the lodge. 

As Erol sprang from his chair 
and dove towards the door, he was 
hit and fell outside. Ignoring his 
wound he kicked over a table and 

PATRICK WILKINS 




•used it as a shield, returning fire. 
Florin’s thought of rescuing him, 
was cut short by Erol’s yell, “Get to 
the back of the lodge. They may 
rush it.” 

Florin made a dash for it, find- 
ing Erol’s words true. The attack- 
ers were moving in. He still heard 
firing from the front and side, so 
he felt reassured. 

He was lost in the blind ritual of 
firing at moving objects. His whole 
mind was devoted to the problems 
of loading clips, changing windows 
to keep everything covered, and 
trying to stay out of the path of the 
viciously whining bullets. 

This was adventure and excite- 
ment. There was the crash of the 
rifles, the nasty whistle of ricochets, 
the moving bodies, sometimes jerk- 
ing ludicrously when hit. Yet, to 
Florin, it was just a job, as it al- 
ways is in the face of danger with 
every man. Just a specialiaed job 
with a very high incentive. 

Staying alive. 

Florin was surprised when he 
realized that he had disposed of all 
the attackers on his side. Despite 
their numbers, they were no match 
for the trio in the lodge. Florin was 
an expert marksman, and Erol and 
Yma had done enough hunting to 
be quite proficient. On the other 
side of the ledger, the people’s 
committee were completely new to 
the business, some of them never 
having held a gun, and certainly 
not used to combat in woods. 

When he went up front, he found 
that Erol had done a magnificent 
job despite his wound, beating back 
several attacks, and killing or 
wounding all his men. But he had 
received two more wounds and he 
was lying on the flagstone terrace 



in a litter of blood and cartridge 
cases. 

The firing from the bushes at the 
side had stopped too, and Yma 
came rushing up, to kneel beside 
her father. She screamed at Florin 
to get bandages, but it was too late. 

In the pastoral woods, men had 
fought and died, and now they felt 
tragedy. But the sky was still blue, 
and in a nearby d^e, a bird war- 
bled freely. 

L ate that night, Florin and 
Yma stopped at a .small cabin 
in the mountains, finding it de- 
serted. They had been travelling 
on foot since the fight, leaving the 
gyros as too obvious a method of 
travel. 

Yma was still upset over her 
father’s death, and Florin had re- 
mained quiet in consideration. The 
mountain paths were rocky and 
steep, and they were both ex- 
hausted. After a cold meal, they 
sat in the gathering darkness in the 
cabin and talked. 

“I know it’s inconsiderate of me 
to talk of it,” Florin said, “but 
don’t you feel resentment against 
tlie men who killed your father?” 
She shook her head and said, “I 
can’t feel resentment, I know that 
it was just circumstances. Those 
men felt justified in what they did 
— and maybe they were.” 

“How can you be so cold- 
blooded?” he said half-angrily. 
“Killing is never justified, and ig- 
norance and violence against in- 
telligent and kindly men are the 
supreme injustice.” 

“Why bother discussing the right 
and wrong of it,” she said wearily. 
“It is all over with, all so meaning- 

47 



MONEY IS THE ROOT OF ALL GOOD 




less — and easily forgotten.” 

“That’s just it,” Florin said ear- 
nestly. “You’ve got to think about 
it, decide who was right and who 
was wrong. You’ve got to decide 
so that you can base your future 
actions and attitudes on that. You 
can’t just mark it off the books, for 
it will still be in your head, all 
jumbled emotion and no sense.” 

He was trying desperately to 
bring her out of apathy. He knew 
that the incident and all of its con- 
tributing factors must be clinically 
analyzed, for both their sakes. 

Again she shook her head. “No, 
they were right, they were betrayed. 
Some of those people had their 
life’s saving of luxury pay invested 
in the corporation-men, and when 
those men failed them, they lost 
their savings and their futures. Pov- 
erty is a treacherous catalyst, it 
makes men do weird and horrible 
things. Common tricks of psychol- 
ogy added to that, make the whole 
mess into a primitive society of re- 
venge and hatred.” 

Florin saw he had her on the 
right track, but ran his hand 
through his hair in bewilderment 
as he asked, “But why? We can see 
the result, but nobody is willing to 
tell the cause. I’ve got to know.” 
She looked at him, barely dis- 
cemable in the dark cabin, then 
said, “Why are you so interested? 
Why did you help us?” 

“I told you. I was a student of 
Tomlin, and a believer in the 
principles of this planet. I saw it 
produce a society where intelli- 
gence and virtue were manifest — 
whether for mercenary or other 
reasons is inconsequential. It 
worked, and it made a wonderful 
world. I wanted to do my part in 

48 



that world — my world. 

“Now I want to know why my 
world has crumbled into a scream- 
ing madhouse of violence.” 

“Yes, I can understand all too 
well how you feel. It’s really horri- 
ble when you have grown up in a 
society, learned about its every in- 
tricacy, its principles, and come to 
have faith in it — then see it sud- 
denly disintegrate. 

“You come to think of your so- 
ciety ai the universe, nothing else 
is as permanent as your world, your 
people. You make plans and move 
through that society, believing in it 
with a faith stronger than any re- 
ligious faith — for you can see and 
understand it constantly. 

“Then something like this hap- 
pens. The familiar still exists, but 
palled with suffering and horror. 
People you have known suddenly 
become beasts. Your world has col- 
lapsed. And even if you know the 
reason, it doesn’t seem possible, the 
reason is out of a textbook and un- 
real, but the disillusionment and 
despair are all too real. 

“And from such a disintegration, 
you learn one important thing — 
how abysmally ignorant you are of 
the society that you’ve lived in, and 
of people in general.” 

There was a long silence. 

Finally she said, “I believe in 
you, and I believe you should know 
the reason.” 

It was a strange scene as the two 
people, dirty and tired, sat in the 
crude cabin by the moonlight and 
discussed the fate of a world. 

“When this planet was colon- 
ized,” Yma began, “everyone 
laughed at us, and said that our 
radical socio-economic system 
couldn’t work. All types of people 

PATRICK WILKINS 




started here. Some were merely 
looking for a final refuge, some 
were criminals and confidence men 
out to ‘take’ this ‘starry-eyed flock 
of crackpots’. Most of them, 
though, were solid citizens, who be- 
lieved that this system of paying a 
man for his intelligence and virtue 
on a carefully regulated basis was 
the proper compromise between 
reality and altruism to achieve a 
Utopia. 

“As you know, it did produce a 
peaceful, cultural world that has 
few if any equals in the galaxy. 
There was one dangerous element 
in the plan though. Men were paid 
for their ability and it was money 
that was used; and wherever there 
is money there is dishonesty and 
greed. We had security and precau- 
tions against such things disrupting 
us internally, but we never counted 
on outside interference. 

“We joined that galactic com- 
pany known as Universal Relief. 
Our government maintained that it 
performs the highest type of good 
deeds, they do it for profit, never- 
thele.ss it was .still a beneficial or- 
ganization. Its motive of meritori- 
ous work for profit was quite sim- 
ilar to our own economic structure, 
so we invested heasily in the com- 
pany, both on an individual and a 
governmental level. We also gave 
them a large premium, because of 
our — well, our eccentricity. We 
were considered unstable, and I 
guess the company knew what it 
was talking about.’’ The last com- 
ment was with a wry bitterness that 
stung Florin. 

“Anyway, in the last few years a 
rival company has sprung up. This 
company, Galactic Aid, has made 
great strides and is a serious com- 



jjetitor to Universal Relief. 

“ — The managers of Galactic Aid 
thought that if they could take our 
account and investment from Uni- 
versal, Galactic Aid would have a 
distinct advantage and eventually 
break their competitor. They tried 
salesmanship first, but we were 
loyal to the original company. 

“Then they tried other means.” 

Until then her story had been 
told in the dispassionate voice of a 
mechanical reader, but when she 
continued, there was vehemence. 

“In a galactic company there is 
inconceivable power, and incon- 
ceivable greed. They arc willing, 
and able, to go to any lengths to 
gain an economic advantage over a 
rival. The fate of one planet, more 
or less, is irrelevant. 

“Galactic Aid’s method of de- 
stroying us for that advantage was 
very crude and very simple; but 
effective because of its simplicity. 

“As you know, the ratio of cor- 
poration-men to citizens here is 
very disproportionate, and the 
economy of the planet is vested in 
comparatively few individuals. 
These few people were the ones 
Galactic Aid attacked. 

“They sent their agents to the 
corporation-men, my father in- 
cluded, and told them to stop re- 
search, writing, art, or whatever 
they were doing to earn their luxury 
pay. They promised protection if 
they were threatened by the peo- 
ple, and also promi.sed full rc-in- 
statement after normalcy had re- 
turned, plus a sizeable bonus for 
co-operating. The ones who le- 
fused this offer, were threatened, 
each one personally and their fam- 
ilies. It was mass terrorization, and 
they actually killed a few to prove 

49 



MONEY IS THE ROOT OF ALL GOOD 




their seriousness. 

“Because of our social structure, 
this plan could, and did work. 
There are only 224 corporation- 
men with over a hundred stock- 
holders. These people are, of 
course, quite clannish and have lit- 
tle actual contact with the masses. 
Therefore, this mass threat was 
heightened by the unity of the small 
group that it affected. 

“You know the rest. Under this 
pressure the incorporated men 
stopped producing, the economy 
crumbled, and the riots began. 

“We have developed a peaceful, 
cultural society, but no matter how 
civilized and stabilized a society is, 
once you knock out the financial 
props, the populace is going to go 
mad. 

“The corporation men didn’t re- 
ceive the promised protection. They 
soon realized that they had been 
tricked, but it was too late. Galactic 
Aid wanted them destroyed by the 
mob; they wanted murder and 
riots; and they wanted a Class AA 
emergency which would drain Uni- 
versal Relief’s resources. 

“They wanted an economic de- 
bacle on Lyrane, thus cutting off a 
large source of Universal’s income. 

“When the corporation-men tried 
to tell the people the truth, the 
mobs called them liars and killed 
them.” 

Yma appeared to be more re- 
laxed after she had relieved her 
burdened mind. Florin, however, 
was stunned. 

“I know it’s terrible,” she said, 
“but what can we do? What can 
anyone do? Their plan has suc- 
ceeded, and the planet is too far 
into chaos to patch up things. 

“There is notliing that can be 

50 



done, so we have only individual 
survival to consider.” 

Florin said, “I don’t know what 
your personal plans are, but I’ve 
got to go back to the cities. I’ve got 
work to do.” She didn’t question 
him. 

The next morning, after a solid 
night’s sleep, they separated. Yma 
headed through the mountains to 
some relatives, while Florin struck 
out for the capital. 

T he office of the new, self- 
appointed Planetary Governor 
of Lyrane was quite busy. It was 
the disorganization of a new of- 
fice, set up during an emergency. 
And yet, it was an office, a recog- 
nizable political mechanism. 

Considering the murderous im- 
broglio that this planet had been 
facing, such an office, even in dis- 
organized form, was quite surpris- 
ing. 

Due to the confusion and a 
knack for bluffing, Florin Brite was 
able to gain admittance to the Sec- 
retary-Governor’s office. This of- 
ficial, a former municipal police 
chief, was obviously impressed with 
his new position. He was quite 
brusque to Florin. 

“What is it man? I hope that it’s 
important — don’t want my time 
wasted. We’re frightfully busy.” 

“I can see that, sir. I merely 
wished to establish my clas.sification 
in the new administration.” 

“Good grief man!” the Secre- 
tary-Governor exploded. “We’ve 
published classification lists. Do I 
have to tell every man, woman and 
child their classification? Are you 
blind — or just too lazy to read?” 
“My classification isn’t listed,” 

PATRICK WILKINS 




Florin said mildly. 

“Isn’t listed? What classification 
is that?” 

“A scientist — and a former cor- 
poration-man.” 

Years of police work and interro- 
gation had steeled the official. 
There was no surprise shown. “Wc 
handle those cases directly, Mr. ah 
—ah—” 

“Florin Brite.” 

“Mr. Brite, there is a feeling of 
— uh — well, touchiness about such 
individuals so we handle their cases 
in confidence. I’m glad you came 
here — ” 

“Yes, you’re quite delighted,” 
Florin was no longer mild. “You’re 
also quite amazed — for you had no 
idea that there were any corpora- 
tion-men left after the ‘purge’, a 
very thorough purge, I might add.” 

“Now, see what I mean about 
touchiness? We were not responsi- 
ble, not even involved in that mc.ss. 
This new government is comptosed 
of citizens who merely wish stabil- 
ity and sanity. Co-operation is our 
keynote — ” 

“Cut it. I don’t need the party 
platform. I’ve read your handbills. 
I just want to know, what about 
me?” 

“Well, you will undoubtedly have 
to be put under some sort of pro- 
tective custody. There is still strong 
feeling — ” 

Their tete a tete was interrupted 
by a rushing clerk shouting wildly. 

“They did it! Universal Relief 
finally declared it a Class A A I” 

The clerk was brandishing a 
.sheet of paper, which he profl'ered 
to the Secretary, who took it with 
an expression of pleasure. His read- 
ing was interrupted by Florin’s 
voice. 



“It seems highly unnecessary that 
wc be declared Class AA now. You 
people have done such a marvelous 
job of organizing an emergency 
government that everything seems 
to be well under control.” 

“Nonsense man,” the Secretary 
declared. “There is still isolated 
fighting and rioting, even murder 
is not unusual.” 

“I merely wished to congratulate 
you on your speedy action. It was 
almost as if this government was 
waiting to spring into existence.” 
The irony was very thinly veiled. 

The Planetary Governor himself 
had entered the office while Florin 
was speaking. 

There was ice in his voice as he 
said, “What do you mean by that, 
sir?” 

Florin turned and bowed to him. 
When he spoke again, the v'eil was 
torn off and the irony was as fla- 
grant as a dead rat — and as fra- 
grant. 

“Good day sir. I’m delighted to 
meet you. I was merely comment- 
ing to your Secretary on your effi- 
ciency and speed which has so 
helped this planet in its hour of 
need.” 

The Governor’s eyes ossified. 
“Just words. What do you want?” 

The irony disappeared, and 
Florin’s voice transmuted to a tone 
of accustomed authority. “I want 
to find out just how you were able 
to organize and take over so quick- 
ly in this emergency. With this 
planet’s economy completely shot 
after the corporation-men quit pro- 
ducing and with stocks down to 
nothing, I am fascinated by the 
problem of how you got financial 
backing.” , 

“That is none of your business.” 

51 



MONEY IS THE ROOT OF ALL GOOD 




“On the contrary, it is very much 
my business. You left your offices 
in rather a turmoil in your rush to 
take control. Since you haven’t had 
the time to security screen your 
governmental employees, the files 
were as open as if they'd been set 
on the sidewalks. 

“From those files, my agents have 
procured some interesting items, 
such as — ’’ and he paused to pull 
out a sheaf of papers — “cancelled 
checks made out to officials of your 
new government from Titanic 
Food Distributors, a subsidiary of 
Galactic Aid. 

“Also a detailed plan of organi- 
zation for this government, outlin- 
ing each step for acquisition of 
power during the emergency. This 
plan is dated two years ago and is 
initialed ‘CRS’, which, I believe, 
are the initials of the president of 
Galactic Aid Incorporated. Hand- 
writing analysts will sew that one 
up. 

“The plan is quite fascinating. It 
gives the procedure for your pres- 
ent establishment: the vigilantes 

gradually converted to city coun- 
cils, local governments, consisting 
of confused and unprepared citizens 
gullible to the suggestions of agent 
provocateurs, regional then inter- 
national conventions to formulate 
the new government. And at every 
turn, every election, guided by 
citizen-agents who would never 
have seen political power under the 
old status quo. 

“The future of this plan is even 
more fascinating — putting Lyrane 
on an industrialized economy, when 
Lyrane has never had industrial po- 
tential, gumming up the works with 
embargoes and tariffs; and a bu- 
reaucratic, leech-like government 

52 



that will sop up everything in taxes.-' 

“It’s a masterpiece of planning — 
of planning the permanent finan- 
cial and moral destruction of a 
planet.’’ 

The planetary officials had sud- 
denly been confronted by a master 
duelist, this stranger was a swords- 
man with complete command of 
ripo.ste, parry and thrust. All they 
could do was try a few clumsy 
lunges. 

“Just who the hell are you to 
take charge this way and say these 
preposterous things?'’ the Governor 
asked. 

Florin replied. “You, I know, are 
a minor e.xecutive of one of Galac- 
tic Aid’s subsidiaries. I happen to 
be Roald Gibbons, head of Uni- 
versal Relief. 

“And since you want the cards 
on the table — here they are. 

“We have this evidence that I 
hav-e mentioned, and much more, 
all under lock and key now. We 
will use that evidence to prove that 
this planetary government was and 
is sponsored by Galactic Aid for 
the purpose of exploiting this 
planet in a negative sense and 
thereby removing it from the ac- 
counts of Universal Relief. 

“We also have a solid case to 
prove that you, or some of your 
cohorts, incited the original trea- 
son and violence that caused this 
whole mess. My special investiga- 
tors have unearthed the cobra nest 
of your government, while I per- 
sonally had the satisfaction of 
gathering proof of your hand in the 
corporation-men purge.” 

From a casual administrative 
difficulty. Florin had turned the 
conversation, since he entered, into 
a venomous attack. Florin had re- 



PATRICK WILKINS 




maincd standing, but the two of- 
ficials had retired to chairs. As op- 
position, they were discouragingly 
silent, but Florin had more than 
enough to carry the conversation 
alone. 

The two governors were just lis- 
tening. appalled, but as all men do 
when they watch their world crum- 
bling, figuring angles, escapes, ex- 
planations. But Florin, or rather 
Roald, was smashing angles faster 
than they could think of them. 

“Furthermore,” he continued to 
the silent men, “if you will read 
that bulletin declaring this planet 
under Class AA emergency, you 
will find some interesting facts. As 
you may or may not know, when a 
planet is declared Class AA by a 
relief company, that company is 
empowered by galactic law to have 
several controls. 

“Those controls consist of com- 
plete administration of the planet 
until status quo is resumed, estab- 
lishment of martial law with the 
right to arrest and confiscate any 
persons or things that may have 
caused the emergency, confiscation 
of all planetary currency to be re- 
tained and re-issued at face value 
when normalcy returns and, of 
course, the right to bring charges 
in Galactic Court against individ- 
uals or organizations that have 
caused the emergency. 

"On that last point, we. Uni- 
versal Relief that is, have many 
charges to bring against Galactic 
Aid and its agents on this planet. 
First there is the charge of coercion, 
readily proved by the testimony of 
the corporation-men . yes, there 
arc some left. We protected them. 
Other charges will include inciting 
planetary revolution, establishing a 



false government through outside 
sources, and — oh, just lots of others. 

“Since you arc an executive in 
Galactic Aid’s organization, I will 
speak for your benefit now.” Roald 
moved over and faced the Gover- 
nor. 

“You were pulled in from .some 
desk job to handle this fledgling 
government. You had your orders, 
and for you it was mastly a paper 
op>eration. You understand what I 
have just been talking about, be- 
cause you know galactic law. 

“But now, let’s talk about some- 
thing you aren’t familiar with. Let’s 
talk about violence, death, and a 
sick planet — the things that your 
company planned and e.xecutcd. 

“For that your company will 
stand trial and be found guilty. It 
will probably be outlawed, and cer- 
tainly bankrupt once fines and 
reparations are paid. Meanwhile, 
this planet, under the guidance of 
Universal Relief, will be hcljjed to 
recuperate and the people will be 
informed of the gross injustice they 
have suffered. I am sure they will 
then desire to return to their previ- 
ous system. 

“But so much for the future. 
What about the past? Do you fully 
realize the enormity of the crime 
that your company has committed? 

“Of course you don’t. You 
weren’t with me when I saw a nice 
old gentleman, one of the most 
brilliant minds of the age, blasted 
down with primitive rifles and even 
more primitive rage. You haven’t 
heard the screams at night, have 
you? You weren’t around, and nei- 
ther was I, thank God, when Gerta 
Robin, that beautiful woman physi- 
cist was caught by the mob.

A Pattern 
for 

Penelope 

Here is the story that 
tells us why the first day 
of February, 1956, was 
a very significant day for 
Miss Haskell, her cat 
Penelope and — the entire 
Universe! . 

BY ROBERT F. YOUNG 



T he first of February, nine- 
teen hundred and fifty-six was 
a date of considerable significance 
on Miss Haskell’s calendar. It 
marked the day on which she dis- 
covered that she needed new eye- 
glasses. 

Galactically speaking, however, 
the first of February, nineteen hun- 
dred and fifty-six, was significant 
in quite another way. Its equivalent 
on the galactic calendar, which 
takes such factors as relative axial 
rotations and relative orbital ve- 
locities into consideration, marked 
the “day” on which a new quality 
emerged from behind the crude 
pillars of Arrogance and Conceit, 
which hitherto had supported the 
galactic credo, and stepped into 
the civilized radiance of a quarter 
of a million suns. Due to the for- 
tuitous circumstances of its intro- 
duction it captivated the entire ga- 
lactic civilization in a matter of 
galactic minutes, undermined the 
whole socio-centric structure, and 
led ultimately to the recognition of 
a number of primitive cultures 
which the Supreme Council had 
steadfastly snubbed for galactic 
centuries. 

It was a quality that was only 
relatively new. On primitive Earth 
it had been around for centuries 
and Earth philosophers were still 
vying with each otlier in their vari- 
ous attempts to name it. Some of 
them called it “naive sentimental- 
ism” and one of them in particular 
called it “reverence for life”. Earth 
poets, who were supposed to be well 
versed in such phenomena, were 
wont to call it “humility” . 

In its nascent phase, the first of 
February, nineteen hundred and 
fifty-six — insofar as it applied to 



54 





Illustrated by Kelly Frees 



Miss Haskell — gave no intimation 
that it was going to be noticeably 
difTercnt from its predecessor, the 
thirty-first of January, nineteen 
hundred and fifty-six. She got up 
at her usual hour, hurried down- 
stairs and dressed in the warmth of 
the kitchen the way she always did 
during the winter months. She put 
the teakettle on and made a few 
typical remarks to Penelope on the 
subject of New England winters. 



Then, unsuspectingly, she went out 
to get the milk. 

The milk bill regarded her bleak- 
ly when she opened the lid of the 
small insulated milk box. The 
“Plca.se” written diagonally across 
its white countenance was what she 
noticed first, and small wonder 
since there were four lines under it 
this time instead of the three she 
was accustomed to. Reluctantly, she 
lowered her eyes to the total. 





$23.17, she read. She knew then 
that the day wasn’t going to be an 
ordinary one after all, despite its 
deceptive beginning. 

She shivered in the cold wind. 
Fine snow was blowing in from the 
ocean, slanting across the low hills 
that lined the shore, finding the 
house and swcejjing unchecked 
from one end of the ofxm back 
porch to the other. There was a 
small boy standing on the summit 
of the highest hill, staring out at 
the somber restless mass of water. 
She noticed him subconsciously just 
before she turned and re-entered 
the kitchen. 

“I don’t know what we’re going 
to do, Penelope,” she said, setting 
the single quart of milk on the 
kitchen table and laying the bill be- 
side it. “I simply don’t know what 
we’re going to do!” 

Penelope yawned. She stretched 
her sleek gray body luxuriously, 
then she jumped down from the 
rocker and confidently approached 
the saucer behind the stove. 

“Oh, I know you’re not wor- 
ried,” Miss Haskell said. “You 
don’t have to try to stretch your 
pension. All you have to do is sleep 
and drink milk, and I never did see 
a cat who could drink as much 
milk as you do'” She turned back 
the tinfoil cap of the milk bottle 
and went over to the stove and 
filled the saucer. “Just the same,” 
she added softly, “I don’t know 
what I’d do without you.” 

She returned the milk bottle to 
the table and procured a tea bag 
and a cup from the cupboard. Pas.s- 
ing the window she noticed die 
small boy again, consciously this 
time. She paused, staring out into 
the wind-slanted snow. He was 



standing motionlessly on the hill- 
top, looking out across the forebod- 
ing waste of snow-pocked waves 
and troughs as though he were con- 
fronted with the most intriguing 
vista of his lifetime. Why, Miss 
Haskell thought, he’ll freeze stand- 
ing out there! He’ll catch his death 
of cold standing out there in that 
cold wind without even a coat on! 

She opened the door and stepped 
out on the back porch. She called 
out, her thin voice fighting valiant- 
ly with the wind. “Little boy,” she 
called. “Little boy!” After a mo- 
ment he turned around and faced 
her. Even at that distance she no- 
ticed that there was something un- 
usual about him. 

She beckoned to him. After hesi- 
tating a moment he started walk- 
ing toward the house, down the 
white hillside and across the wind- 
swept patch of ground where last 
summer Miss Haskell had raised 
string beans and red potatoes. He 
walked lightly over the uneven, 
slightly tumbled earth, not stum- 
bling once, and he stopper! at the 
foot of the porch steps. He looked 
up at her questioningly. 

He had the largest, widest eyes 
that she had ever .seen. Looking 
down into their gray depths she 
had the vertiginous feeling that 
she was standing on the brink of 
an abyss, staring into misty concepts 
that were far beyond her ken. For 
a moment her composure deserted 
her, then her eyes dropped to the 
open collar of his strange jacket, 
dropped still farther to the white- 
ness of his bare hands, and it re- 
turned abruptly, accompanied by 
indignation. 

“S'oung man, you get into this 
house right this minute!” she said,

in a manner reminiscent of Aunt 
Polly laying down the law to Tom 
Sawyer. “Standing out there in the 
wind on the coldest day of winter 
without even a coat on. Why, you’re 
liable to catch your death! The 
idea!” 

She thought his eyes widened 
slightly, but she wasn’t sure. It 
didn’t seem possible that they could 
get much wider. His expres.sion, 
which reminded her of the expres- 
sions she used to see long ago when 
she had been a country school 
teacher and had found it frequently 
necessary to interrupt her charges 
in the midst of their grandiose day- 
dreams, changed appreciably. It 
became friendly and disarming. 
“I’m not really very cold,” he said 
in an astonishingly pleasant voice, 
“but I’ll come in if you like.” 

“Not really very cold indeed!” 
Miss Haskell said, holding the door 
open for him. “Why you look as 
though you’re half frozen!” (He 
really did : his face and hands were 
almost shockingly white.) “You sit 
down now, and I’ll fix you a cup 
of tea. What’s your name?” 

“Otelis.” He looked around him 
as though he were intensely inter- 
ested in every detail of the small 
crowded kitchen. He paid particu- 
lar attention to the position of the 
several chairs. ( Penelope was out of 
sight behind the stove, still pre- 
occupied with her milk.) 

“Why what an odd name!” Miss 
Haskell said, getting another tea 
bag and another cup from the cup- 
board. “What won’t people ’oe 
naming their children next! Live 
near here?” 

“Yes, in a way.” He sat down in 
the rocker which faced the window 
and from which a view of the ocean 

A PATTERN FOR PENELOPE 



could be obtained. “Relatively 
speaking, I live quite close.” 

Miss Haskell wondered why he 
didn’t take his hat off. People sim- 
ply didn’t bring up their children 
the way they used to, .she thought, 
and they didn’t dress them snug 
and warm the way they used to 
citlier. The hat, for instance, was a 
flim.sy little thing consisting of noth- 
ing but silvery wiielike threads 
woven loosely together, and it 
didn’t even come down far enough 
to cover his ears! 

She sighed. “I guess I just can’t 
keep track of my neighbors any 
more,” she said. “A body gets old so 
fast it seems like the years just fly 
by!” 

“You’re not so very old, are 
you?” Otelis asked. 

“I’ll never see sLxty-five again!” 

“But that’s not old at all. 
Why—” 

Miss Haskell had gone to the 
cupboard drawer for spoons. When 
she turned around, the aspect of 
her small guest startled her. He 
was sitting stiffly in the rocker, his 
mouth partly open, his eyes focused 
on something moving towards him 
across the kitchen floor. They had 
definitely widened this time. “What 
in the world is the matter?” she 
said. 

He did not answer. Mi.ss Haskell 
followed the direction of his gaze, 
expecting to see nothing less than a 
saber-toothed tiger, but all she saw 
was Penelope who had emerged 
from behind the stove and was ap- 
proaching the rocker with an air of 
adamantine proprietorship. When 
she reached it she paused for a mo- 
ment and regarded its occupant 
contemplatively. Otelis shrank 
back, his gray eyes enormous. 

57 




“Why you act as though you 
never saw a cat before!” Miss 
Haskell said. 

Penelope leaped then, landing 
softly on his lap. For a while he 
seemed incapable of movement. He 
sat there rigidly, leaning as far back 
in the rocker as he could, his white 
hands tautly gripping the arms. It 
wasn’t until he realized that Pene- 
lope didn’t intend to proceed any 
farther than his lap that he began 
to relax. Presently, after she had 
curled up comfortably and closed 
her eyes, he released one of the 
rocker arms and very cautiously 
moved his hand to the gray, softly 
pulsating body. 

Wonderment suffused his face. 
“Why,” he said, “it makes a noise!” 

“She’s puTTing!" Miss Haskell 
said. “For heaven’s sake, didn’t you 
ever hear a cat purr before? Are 
you a city boy?” 

“I — I’m afraid I neglected to 
learn about cats. I must have missed 
them somehow. But oceanography’s 
my speciality. That’s the main rea- 
son my planet paper received merit- 
classification.” 

“You must be a city boy, study- 
ing such outlandish subjects and 
not knowing anything atout such 
ordinary creatures as cats!” Miss 
Haskell got the kettle from the 
stave and filled the two cups. “I 
drink mine plain,” she said, sitting 
down, “but you can have some of 
Penelope’s milk in yours. And of 
course you’ll want sugar. All boys 
do.” 

“No, I’ll drink mine the way you 
do,” Otelis said quickly, watching 
her closely as though he were wait- 
ing to ascertain just the way she 
did drink it. 

“Well, be careful then. It’s awful- 

58 



ly hot.” She raised the steaming cup 
to her lips and took a careful sip. 

Otelis followed suit. He set the 
cup down very quickly, Miss Has- 
kell thought. When he did so his 
hand happened to touch the milk 
bill, and he picked it up, as though 
he were eager to occupy his atten- 
tion with something other than tea. 
“What’s this?” he asked. 

“It’s the milk bill, but I’m afraid 
it’s Penelope’s death notice, too.” 
Miss Haskell slumped a little in her 
chair. “If I can’t pay it this month 
they aren’t going to write ‘Please’ 
any more. They just aren’t going to 
leave any more milk.” 

“Then why don’t you pay it?” 

“I can’t. Not till my pension 
comes, and that’s a long ways off.” 
“You mean Penelope will die?" 
His gray eyes had attained their 
maximum circumference. 

“She will without her milk.” 

He looked down suddenly at the 
cat curled up in his lap. He ran his 
fingers gently up and down her 
back and the purring crescendoed, 
filling the kitchen. “Why,” he said, 
“she’s beautiful in a way. She 
shouldn’t have to die. That’s 
wrong.” 

“Lots of things are wrong in this 
world,” Miss Haskell said, “but I 
guess there isn’t very much we can 
do about them. But I shouldn’t be 
talking like this,” she added quick- 
ly. “Carrying on like a lonely old 
woman, telling a little boy all my 
troubles. You just drink your tea 
now, and forget about Penelope.” 
“Funny how I missed cats that 
way,” he said abstractedly. Abrupt- 
ly he raised his eyes and stared 
through the window at the somber 
expanse of ocean that showed dark- 
ly beyond the thickening snow. 

ROBERT F. YOUNG 




Miss Haskell saw an expression of 
boyish yearning settle upon his face, 
saw a far-away look come into his 
eyes. He sat there immobile for a 
long time, his eyes lost, and then, 
slowly, the expression faded and 
his eyes returned from wherever 
they had been and dropped gently 
back to Penelope. 

“I always sort of liked oceans,” 
he said. “I don’t know why. Be- 
cause they’re so big, I guess.” 
“What do oceans have to do with 
cats?” Miss Haskell asked in be- 
wilderment. 

A smile flickered at the corners 
of his mouth. The word “wistful” 
entered Miss Haskell’s mind, then 
ran quickly out again when she saw 
how serene his eyes had become. 
“Quite a lot,” he said. He stood up, 
first lifting Penelope from his lap 
and depositing her carefully on the 
kitchen floor. He seemed taller 
somehow. “I have to go now. 
Thank you very much for the tea.” 
“You’re very welcome,” Miss 
Haskell said, “although I don’t be- 
lieve you touched a drop of it.” 

He picked up the milk bill once 
more and stared at it VC17 intently. 
The silvery threads of his ridicu- 
lous hat seemed to glow. Finally he 
laid the bill down again and he 
walked over to the door. 

“Make sure you go straight home 
now,” Miss Haskell said, getting up 
and opening the door for him. 
“Don’t let me catch you standing 
out there in that cold wind again!” 
“I won’t be standing out there 
any more,” he said. 

He paused for a moment on the 
porch steps, staring across the field 
and the snow-blurred hills at the 
leaden grayness of the ocean. Then 
he went down the steps and started 

A PATTERN FOR PENELOPE 



across the field toward the highest 
hill. “Goodbye,” he called over his 
shoulder. 

“Goodbye!” Miss Haskell shouted 
into the wind. 

She watched him from the win- 
dow. It was snowing harder than 
ever now and by the time he 
reached the hill she could barely 
see him at all. He probably lived in 
one of the winterized summer cot- 
tages that stood a short distance 
down the beach, she thought. She 
wished suddenly that she had asked 
him specifically, and wished too 
that she had thought to ask him 
why he wasn’t in school. But it was 
too late now. Fie was climbing the 
hill now, a vague blur of a little 
boy in a New England snowstorm. 
Just before he reached the summit 
a gust of wind sprang up in a wild 
white flurry and engulfed him, and 
by the time the flurry had died 
away the hill was empty. 

Miss Haskell sighed, more aware 
of her loneliness than usual. But of 
course there was Penelope, and as 
long as she had Penelope she could 
never be completely lonely. Think- 
ing of Penelope reminded her of 
the milk bill, and with a shudder 
she went over to the table and 
picked it up, intending to put it 
it away somewhere where she 
wouldn’t have to look at it. But be- 
fore she put it away she looked at 
it once more, and that was when 
she discovered that she needed new 
eyeglasses. 

T he M.C. waited until the last 
child had stepped out of the 
vertical halo of the matter trans- 
mitter and had taken his assigned 
seat upon the studio stage. Then 

59 




he stepped before the gargantuan 
eye of the tele-camera and faced 
the galaxy-wide audience. Beside 
him the Alterator scintillated like 
a complex silver web. 

“You have just witnessed the 
winners of the ‘My Favorite Primi- 
tive Planet’ essay contest returning 
from their sojourns on the planets 
which they selected as the subjects 
of their winning essays,” he said. 
“During these sojourns they have 
instituted the temporal alterations 
granted to them as a reward of 
merit, and in a moment they will 
come forward singly and validate 
those alterations before the Altera- 
tor. 

“This contest has been sponsored 
by the Society for the Encourage- 
ment of Youthful Confidence in an 
attempt to impress upon the minds 
of our galactic-citizens-to-be some 
idea of the omnipotence to which 
their scientific heritage entitles 
them, and to give them some con- 
ception, through studying the lan- 
guage, customs and literature of in- 
ferior cultures, of the supreme su- 
periority of our own culture. Nat- 
urally, due to the serious ramifica- 
tions that might result from tam- 
pering with certain integral time 
patterns, the winners were in- 
structed to confine all alterations of 
a geographical nature to nominal 
patterns only, and those of an his- 
torical nature to events which did 
not involve strong philosophical or 
ethical trends. Each winner was 
limited to one alteration.” 

The M.C. turned toward the 
stage where the children sat wait- 
ing, their white faces shining, their 
little alterator helmets twinkling 



brightly in the radiance of the 
studio lights. “You will come for- 
ward one at a time and orally sub- 
mit your alterations for validation,” 
he said. “Alesa, would you like 
to be first?” 

Alesa walked demurely across the 
stage and stood before the intricate 
web of shining thread-like wires. 
“The name ‘Tekit,’ most magnifi- 
cent city on Tarth 7, to ‘Alesa’,” 
she said. 

The Alterator hummed. Alesa re- 
turned to her seat. 

“Voris?” 

Voris came forward a little shy- 
ly. “ ‘Liliel’, largest continent on 
Fruith 3, to ‘Voris’.” 

“Stris?” 

“The ‘Metnumen’ system of gov- 
ernment of Matnanet, Sairis 12, to 
the ‘Stris’ system of government.” 

“Elora?” 

“The river ‘Tib’, on Tranuska 2, 
to the river 'Elora’.” 

“Otelis?” 

He felt ashamed at first, standing 
up there in front of all those famous 
children whose names were already 
integrated in geography textbooks 
all over the galaxy. And then, sud- 
denly, he didn’t feel ashamed any 
more at all. He felt proud instead, 
and he stood up very straight be- 
fore the dazzling web of the Altera- 
tor and he said what he had to say 
with quiet dignity. 

“ ‘$23.17’ on the milk bill of Miss 
Abigail Haskell, Rural Route No. 
4, Smithport, Massachusetts, Amer- 
ica, Sol 3, to ‘$00.00’,” he said, 
“and the word ‘Please’ on same bill 
to the word ‘Paid’.” 

The North “Otelis” Ocean 
wouldn’t have sounded right any- 
way. • • •

THE NAME OF THIS CITY 



The rebellion of Mankind was successful, and the fate of 
Loki, Lakkuret Administrator, rested with the rebel 
leader. Skelling, the rebel leader, didn’t know it but in 
his decision also rested the fate of Mankind. 



BY JOHN CHRISTOPHER 



H uman servants admitted 
Henry Skelling, Advisor for 
Putnek, to the presence of the Lak- 
kuret Administrator. Skelling, as 
was necessary, bowed to the Ad- 
ministrator in the presence of the 
servants. Then the Administrator 
dismissed the servants. It had been 
an innovation of his own to do this 
during routine interviews. Skelling, 
who had been Advisor for Putnek 
for a very long time, could remem- 
ber the previous Administrator; he 
had always kept the servants by 
him except for top-secret discus- 
sions, and they were rare. 

The Administrator’s name was 
Loki — on Lakkuret, at any rate, 
the Mirmi never owned to more 
than one name. There was a title, 
of course. Sir Loki. It was odd, 
Skelling thought, that they kept 
the vernacular for a thing like that. 



Loki spoke. “Well, Skelling, how 
are things?” 

He spoke a clear precise English, 
clearer, Skelling knew, than his 
own. 

“They might be worse. At least 
there isn’t quite as much unrest as 
there was a couple of days ago. But 
things are hanging fire now, wait- 
ing on the Berlin news.” 

Loki looked up at Skelling. “Yes, 
the Tulinn business.” 

It was difficult to be sure whether 
there was a snub intended in his 
correction of Berlin to Tulinn or 
not. But Skelling had stopped look- 
ing for snubs a good many years 
before. It was the essentials he went 
for now. 

He said, “If the sentence is car- 
ried out, the rising won’t be con- 
fined to this continent.” 

Loki looked at him; hailing from 



62 




a smaller planet his bones were 
longer and more fragile, his muscles 
more easily wearied; he drooped 
languidly in his special Mirmi 
chair. 

“For other continents I have 
other advisers, Skelling. As you 
know.” 

“As I know. All the same, when 
there’s the possibility of a really big 
fire, the man who knows the dry- 
ness of the local tinder is as good a 
guide as any . What do they 
say, by the way?” 

Loki smiled wearily. “You still 
try to p>crsuade me that you don’t 
know exactly what advice I get 
from the others? Skelling, let’s stop 
fooling each other.” 

Skelling looked at him a mo- 
ment, and they both laughed. 

“Skelling, the original regulation 
made any unauthorized entry of a 
Mirmi building punishable by 
death. Two years ago, there was 
the Dietle case. He got a very light 
sentence.” 

“We didn’t think so. Five years 
— and he was shown to be as mad 
as a hatter. To us, it was savage.” 
Loki shook his head. “I’m not 
sure you know as much about the 
Dietle case as you think you do . 
This new affair at Tulinn. Three 
men caught in the Mirmi building 
by night, with equipment for cir- 
cumventing the alarm system- — and 
armed! What verdict can your peo- 
ple possibly expect? What — ” 

“Sir Loki,” Skelling interrupted. 
“When a planet, an entire race, is 
kept in subjection — what do your 
people expect?” 

“What we can command. That 
only. Obedience.” 

“By what right?” 

Loki laughed. “We’ve travelled

a long way. Had your first prede- 
cessor put that question to my first 
predecessor, what would have hap- 
pened?” 

Shelling said evenly, “A public 
flogging, I imagine.” 

“And you imply that the simple 
carrying out of a law, for whose 
breaking the p>enalty is well known, 
would be brutal?” 

Skclling looked at him warily. 
They had become respectful ad- 
versaries, in a way friends, but he 
still felt, at times, that he was tread- 
ing dangerously. That did not stop 
him from putting his foot down 
with some weight. 

“We’ve civilized you, but not to 
the extent we would like. Yes, it 
would be brutal.” 

Loki laughed quite a long time. 
Shelling waited for him to stop. 

Still smiling a little Loki said, 
“I’ve been looking through some of 
our early adrr.inistrative reports. 
They’re interesting. Those for the 
administration of my predecessor 
Skrutt particularly.” 

“Locally known,” Skclling re- 
marked, “as Satan Skrutt.” 

“In one year,” Loki went on, 
“Administrator Skrutt ordered 
more than eighty-four thousand 
executions. And the result? — calm 
over the planet from Surrint to 
Tolda. In my four years there has 
not been a single execution. And 
now, when it looks as though I 
may be forced to act — not harshly 
but, shall we say, firmly — you tell 
me I am threatened by a planet- 
wide wave of revolt.” 

“I tell you the truth.” 

Loki glanced at him. “I don’t 
disbelieve you. My other sources, 
you will be glad to hear, confinn 
it. But tell me, what will be the 

64 



reason for the revolt — excessive 
harshness or excessive laxness?” 
“Neither. That calm — in the 
year of the eighty-four thousand 
executions — did that mean defeat? 
That was Skrutt's last year. His 
successor found as many willing to 
be martyrs; only he didn’t have 
Skrutt’s stomach for the job. Nor 
did he have Skrutt’s instructions; 
your government fell over those 
eighty-four thousand victims. 
Skrutt's successor came out with 
die first glimmering of Mirmi con- 
science behind him.” 

Loki’s look was tired. “Don't lec- 
ture me, Skclling. You can't im- 
agine that all this hasn’t been the 
basis for a lot of discussion back on 
Mirma. Something happened to us 
when we conquered this planet. It 
was not our first conquest, but it 
was the first time we had encoun- 
tered a continuing resistance. We 
met it. with a ptolicy of repression 
— Skrutt had his orders just as 
Nemmin who relieved him had his. 
It failed. There are differing opin- 
ions as to why. Our liberals claim 
that you taught us a lesson in 
ethics. There is another party that 
talks of a failure of nerve— and be- 
lieves that the failure can be re- 
trieved.” 

“And which party — ?” 

“Do I belong to? I am a profes- 
sional administrator, Skclling. Like 
Skrutt, like Nemmin. I take my 
orders, and carry them out to the 
best of my ability.” 

There was a moment’s silence. 
Skelling broke it. 

“Well.” he said, “has the gov- 
ernment fallen?” 

“Tell me,” Loki countered. 
“How do you come to be so well 
informed on Mirmi ptolitics?” 

JOHN CHRISTOPHER 




Skelling allowed a slight trace of 
contempt to enter his voice. “Why 
has the Mirmi term of service here 
been reduced, from five to three 
years? We corrupt your troops 
within a twelve-month of their 
posting here. You know very well 
that if the revolt comes your own 
troops will not be united.” 

“If the revolt comes, I should 
not be too confident that reprisals 
will be confined to the use of Lak- 
kurct-based troops. We can have a 
battle squadron here within two 
weeks. This time it will not be just 
one city ; they will all feel it.” 
Skelling half smiled. “Will Minni 
fire on Mirmi?” 

Loki’s look to Skelling carried 
something that was vague, but it 
might have been an appeal. It was 
incredible that it should be so, but 
it looked that way. 

“We’ve known each other some 
time, Skelling. It was not I who 
sealed your appointment as Ad- 
viser, but I’ve come to rely on you. 
Frankly, I don’t know what the re- 
sult of repressive action would be. 
Neither do you, so we’re equal. But 
one thing you must understand — I 
obey orders. If I am told to use the 
battle fleet, I will use it. I was 
trained from childhood for this 
kind of job. Throughout my career 
I have never failed my superiors. I 
won’t fail them now, either. What- 
ever it involves, I shall do my job.” 
Skelling spoke softly. “I’ll tell 
you what it will involve. Evacua- 
tion. It will be better for you Mirmi 
if you evacuate without bloodshed, 
but evacuate you must. We have 
won already, Sir Loki. It only re- 
mains for your people to recognize 
it.” 

Loki drummed his seven fingers 

THE NAME OF THIS CITY 



on the desk. The screen that was 
set into it was blank. Skelling had 
seen it on other visits covered with 
the blunt clumsy characters of the 
Mirmi language. Loki caught his 
glance. 

“The news should have been 
here by now.” 

“The government will fall,” 
Skelling said. 

“Yes, but to be replaced by 
which party? The government is a 
coalition. What will take its place 
— a government of liberals, or of 
repressives?” 

“Our information says Allef will 
head the new government.” 

“Your information!” Loki’s eyes 
were on the blank screen.- “Camp 
gossip. Sometimes you overestimate 
your powers, Skelling.” 

Skelling said indilTerently : “Per- 
haps.” 

Eyes still on the screen, Loki con- 
tinued : “1 hear rumors of Lakkuret 
politics, too. I hear that, on this 
evacuation supposition, you have 
been created World President- 
Elect. Congratulations.” 

“You know our proverb,” Skell- 
ing said, “about the possible slips 
between cup and lip. A President- 
Elect is not a President.” 

“No, and may never be. But con- 
gratulations, all the same. Should 
we have to abandon this planet, I 
would prefer to think of the ad- 
ministration being in good hands 
after wc had gone; and with you I 
know it would be.” 

“Thank you,” Skelling mur- 
mured. Then in a firmer tone, “I 
would return the compliment but 
for one minor detail — that the 
worst man on Earth would fit your 
place better than you do. Nothing 
personal, you understand.” 



65 




“I understand.” 

The small screen flashed into ac- 
tivity, and they both tensed. Shell- 
ing knew enough Mirmi to pick 
out certain words — “demonstra- 
tion,” “crisis” and “Surrint.” It 
was not the message from Mirrna 
that they were waiting for. 

Loki pressed a button, and the 
message was transferred to the 
large screen on the wall. “Local,” 
he murmured. He pressed another 
button. The writing gave place to 
a street scene. 

“Here,” Loki said with some as- 
tonishment. “In Surrint itself!” 

The camera closed in. The 
marching column was very order- 
ly and very steady, though some of 
the faces looked nervous. They 
were singing the old song, part 
march, part dirge, that dated back 
to the time of Skrutt. They were 
carrying banners; FREEDOM 
NOT SLAVERY— THE BERLIN 
P.ATRIOTS SHALL NOT DIE— 
and, more roughly done but in big- 
ger letters: THE NAME OF 

THIS CITY IS LONDON. 

“I think,” Loki said, “that the 
imposition of Mirmi names on your 
cities may have been a .serious mis- 
take.” 

Skelling pointed to the screen. 
“And — what do you propose to do 
about that?” 

Loki smiled. “Ignore it. It isn’t 
relevant to the main issue. I take it 
you knew this would happen?” 

“I advised against it.” Skelling 
smiled ruefully. “Even a World 
President-Elect does not always 
have his wishes respected. It 
seemed to be a pointless provoca- 
tion while we were waiting for the 
big news from Mirma.” 

A man in the front rank shook 

66 



his fist towards the watching 
camera. He was a little man, and 
he looked scared. 

“If we go,” Loki said, “if we go, 
our stay here will not have been 
quite without advantage to you.” 
“We shall have interstellar travel, 
and a few other gadgets!” 

“No, I didn’t mean that kind of 
thing. You know that. We came to 
a planet that had learned nothing 
from two shattering wars, and was 
preparing to plunge itself into a 
third. We brought you peace.” 

“We remember that propagan- 
da,” Skelling said bitterly. “We re- 
member that we believed the talk 
of benefits — and found ourselves 
slaves.” 

“All the same,” Loki said em- 
phatically, “there were benefits. If 
we went, we should leave you a 
united planet.” 

“A benefit,” Skelling said, “but 
we’ve paid for it. Another civil war 
might not have been worse.” 

“Civil war? Your ancestors 
would not have called it that. Per- 
haps you needed the Mirmi to 
bring these things home to you.” 
“Perhaps.” 

“And us, what becomes of us, 
the Mirmi?” 

“How many planets do you 
claim to have colonized — -two hun- 
dred, three hundred? You have liv- 
ing space enough. You don’t want 
us to feel sorry for you, do you?” 
“A millenium of expansion,” 
Loki said quietly. “Almost exactly 
a millenium. A thousand years of 
expansion, the creation of a stellar 
empire extending over five hun- 
dred light years. You could spare 
some sympathy for us, Skelling. Be- 
cause once we begin to retreat, 
what follows? Once our hegemony 

JOHN CHRISTOPHER 




cracks, it’s an open ring. You aren’t 
the only race to which we’ve given 
interstellar travel. At least, our rule 
brought peace.” 

“The word ‘peace,’ Skelling said, 
“is beginning to hypnotize you. 
Peace . peace . peace. I told 
you we had won already. As for 
what follows — that can wait on 
events. If your grip breaks, I pre- 
sume some other race will supply 
the deficiency.” 

Loki looked at him. “Some other 
race? Men, perhaps?” The Admin- 
istrator shook himself out of his 
languor and sat upright, as upright 
as any of the Mirmi could sit. “You 
know, I have a feeling we have al- 
lowed our conversation to become 
somewhat unreal. We are not here 
to discuss the way your people pro- 
pose to take over our empire, but 
the measures to be adopted against 
the Tulinn saboteurs.” 

“Not that, either. We are here. 
Sir Loki, to pass the time while the 
government falls on Mirma.” 

Loki had left the receiver 
switched onto the big screen, 
though he had cut out the view of 
the demonstration. Now while 
Skelling spoke a message began to 
form. Without letting his attention 
become distracted from vriiat he 
read there, Loki murmured tensely, 
“The Government has fallen.” 
“And . ?” Skelling looked not 
at the screen but at Loki’s face. 
“And Allef . ?” 

The message had ended. Loki 
looked at him. “No, not Allef. 
Mered is the new Chief Minister,” 



F or a moment Skelling let the 
crushing weight of despair mas- 
ter him. Bitter news, and unex- 

THE NAME OF THIS CITY 



pected. Mered was the leader of 
the repressives; translations of his 
speech calling for racial regenera- 
tion and reassumption of the mis- 
sion of conquest had been widely 
disseminated on Lakkuret, which 
had once been known as Earth. 

Gently Loki said, “The Tulinn 
case. I’ve put it up to Mirma Com- 
mand, and there will be no final 
decision until I hear from them. 
But, in view of the change of gov- 
ernment ... I don’t think there 
can be any doubt as to what the 
decision will be.” 

Skelling had recovered himself. 
“What I told you earlier was no 
bluff. Sir Loki. The whole planet 
will rise against you. You have been 
Administrator here for a long time ; 
you can’t look forward with any 
pleasure to what is going to hap- 
pen. If you were to resign rather 
than carry out the decision . 
there must still be a delicate bal- 
ance on Mirma ... it might make 
the difference.” 

Loki’s face was expressionless. “I 
told you, Skelling — I obey orders. I 
was trained for this duty; to carry 
it out, not to shirk it. Let me give 
you some advice instead. Tell your 
people to behave themselves. There 
will be some new regulations, but 
providing they are obeyed there is 
no reason to expect harsh measures. 
I warn you — it is your only hope.” 

“That is not hope,” Skelling said 
tersely. “That is resignation to 
slavery.” 

Loki smiled; the contemptuous- 
looking smile of the Mirmi, but 
there was sadness in it, and wry 
humour. 

“There is a barrier between us, 
Skelling. I have enjoyed your com- 
pany, as I think you have mine, 

67 




and if the barrier were not there 
we might have been friends. You 
are human, and determined to re- 
bel. I am of the Mirmi. That sepa- 
rates us.” 

“Look at it from our point of 
view. Sir Loki.” 

“Look at it from ours. A thou- 
.sand years of empire is not put 
aside in a moment. Had it been 
Allef. 1 would have earned out my 
different orders, but at heart I 
would have been ashamed. 1 have 
been here a long time, and grown 
to love Lakkurct, but there would 
have been the shame of defeat — 
nothing could have prevented that” 

“And there is no shame at the 
thought of the bloody fighting that 
is bound to come?” 

“No shame, Skelling. Regret, but 
not shame. If you humans do re- 
bel and I am still Administrator 
after the rebellion is crushed, 1 
shall try to mitigate the conditions 
that wiil be imposed. It will not be 
easy, but I shall do my best.” 

“This rebellion will not be 
crushed.” 

“^’ou have forgotten our power,” 
said Loki. “You have grown used 
to conce.ssions and the presence of 
garrison troops. It will be a dif- 
ferent matter when the battle 
squadron darkens your skies. Then 
your [>eople will look for holes in 
the ground, as they did before." 

Loki stood up. lie stretched his 
hand out. 

“Goodbye, Skelling. I shall t |7 
to stop the bloodshed. There will 
be planet-wide telecasts about the 
new government, ^'our people will 
be warned by us. if not by you.” 

They shook hands. Skelling spoke 
quietly now. 

68 



“It will do no good.” 

“I shall try, anyway. If I fail . 
I hope that it will soon be over.” 

In the outer rooms there were 
the human servants who had been 
dismissed by Loki at the beginning 
of tile interview. One of Skelling's 
own men was among them. He 
came close to Skelling as he went 
out. 

“Well?” 

“Mered,” Skelling replied. “War. 
But we shall win.” 

He hopied he sounded more con- 
fident than he felt. 



T hey wanted Skelling to leave 
London; the other members of 
the secret NVorld Council had left 
their cities to take up their pre- 
arranged duties as resistance lead- 
ers — cities were potential death- 
traps. Skelling, however, would 
not leave. Loki was still in London, 
although on the day that he or- 
dered the execution of the Berlin 
rebels he dismissed his human serv- 
ing .staff; their purjxisc had, in any 
case, been no more than decorative 
— the work was done by robots. As 
Skelling piointcd out, Loki’s pres- 
ence was a fair indication that, 
whatever happened elsewhere, Lon- 
don would not be bombed. 

By and large, events fell out as 
planned, though there were nerve- 
racking setbacks. The first wave of 
revolt spread from Berlin, and the 
Mirmi garrison there went over to 
the rebels in a matter of hours. 
There was a counter-drive from 
France, and another from Russia 
which tried to pincer with the first, 
but they collapsed separately, and 
within three days the continent of 
Europe w'as in the hands of men 

JOHN CHRISTOPHER 




and the rebel Mirmi. 

A week after the insurrection be- 
gan, only South America and the 
islands of Britain were still ruled 
by Mirmi loyal to their own planet. 
The situation had consolidated, 
and both sides sat back to await the 
intervention — decisive one way or 
the other — of the battle squadron 
from Mirma. Fighting ceased; an 
armed truce took its place. 

There had been relatively little 
bloodshed. No bombing had oc- 
curred; the rebel Mirmi held nine 
tenths of the local space fleet. Their 
units paraded over the centers of 
resistance — Skclling watched them 
hail low over the huddled roofs of 
London — but there was no combat. 
A good sign, Skelling thought at 
first; for men, everything depended 
on the reluctance of Mirmi to fight 
Mirmi. But reflection showed him 
the unwisdom of his confidence — 
these were all Earth-garrison 
Mirmi, sharing the bond of having 
been under human influence. It 
had been that wcapon^ — the human 
power to sway their conquerors — 
which had brought the pre.scnt tem- 
porary success, but there was no 
reason to think that it would apply 
against the Mirmi in the battle 
squadron. They would be coming, 
flushed with that atavistic yearning 
for power which even Loki had 
shown, probably only too ready to 
kill their fellow-Mirmi whom they 
saw as traitors. The game was far 
from over. 

The battle squadron arrived two 
weeks, to the day, after the revolt. 
Somewhere beyond the moon it 
emerged into three-dimensional 
space, but the first that was known 
of its presence was when New York 
was obliterated. Then the telecasts 

THE NAME OF THIS CITY 



carried scenes of the smoking slag- 
heap that had been the city, round 
the entire earth. To reinforce the 
impression the battle squadron it- 
self cruised through the lower at- 
mosphere, showing itself above the 
major centers of population. It was 
a grim and impressive sight; the 
great crui.sers looming monstrously 
in comparison with those ships 
which men had been accustomed 
to see, the pitiably small patrol ves- 
sels on which the hope of liberation 
now rested. Why should the local 
Mirmi defenders pit themselves 
against such odds, against their 
own kind? There was no logical 
reason for it. 

But they did. The battle was 
joined in atmosphere, above the 
Pacific Ocean. The small patrol 
ships, capable of so much greater 
speed and manoeuverability in the 
confinement provided by air pres- 
sure, launched their attack directly 
at the ponderously cruising armada. 
They tore through the loose forma- 
tion, lancing it again and again. 
Some of their electro-corrosion 
charges got through the defence; 
when the battle squadron rose clear 
into free space it left one ship be- 
hind, rolling helplessly on the waves 
of the Pacific. Three patrol ships 
had gone down with it. 

The battle squadron did not 
again venture into the atmosphere. 
Instead, lying just off the planet in 
space, they destroyed Leningrad, 
and dealt Rome a blow that was 
near mortal. The new tactics were 
clear — a progressive destruction of 
the cities of the Earth until the 
rebels begged for peace. 

And the patrol ships went for 
them again. In space they were 
hopelessly ineffective against the 

69 




great cruisers. They attempted only 
diversionary attkeks, flipping up 
through the stratosphere and 
launching their charges, then away 
back to their relative haven. But 
their losses were heavy. Skclling, in 
radio communication with the fleet 
of patrol ships, saw a meteor glow 
red, plunging towards the distant 
Welsh hills, and knew with sadness 
what it was. They were a wonder- 
ful race, the Mirmi. Men might 
have taught them some things, but 
there were other respects in which 
men could only, humbly, learn from 
them. 

For several days the dwindling 
number of the rebel ships continued 
their hopeless struggle. Skelling, ex- 
trapolating on the course of events, 
could fix a term to the possible con- 
tinuation of resistance. Even if the 
Mirmi who had allied them.selves 
with men fought to the bitter end, 
to the last patrolship, within a 
week all would be over. 

But the war was over the follow- 
ing day, and the rebels had won. 

The message came over the tele- 
cast blanket channel, in Mirmi first 
and then in English: _ 

“The 23rd Battle Squadron sa- 
lutes the garrison of Lakkuret. The 
Admiral Besson has been deposed; 
the fleet takes commands from 
Commodore Atark. The blood of 
our brothers has gained the free- 
dom of the humans of Lakkuret; 
to our brothers we surrender the 
fleet and this planet. Mirmi shall 
not slay Mirmi, in an unjust cause. 
We come in peace now, and bring 
liberty.” 

Skelling saw the great armada, a 
menace no longer, sink through the 
English clouds; the .surrender was 
being made, reasonably enough, at 

70 



the old center of government. He 
was called then, and told the other 
news; Loki's p»ersonal retinue, join- 
ing the winning side, had turned 
him over to the Earthmen. 



T O MEN the Minni all looked 
alike. Skelling’s first impression 
was that it was Loki who was sit- 
ting as usual behind his desk. Then 
he saw Loki held prisoner on the 
far side of the room. There were 
two other Mirmi present, and three 
of his own men. The Minn behind 
the desk made the movement with 
his hand which was the greeting 
between equals; .Skelling had never 
received it before. 

“Grceting.s, President. I am 
Atark, Commodore of the Fleet.” 
“Greetings,” Skelling replied. 
“The men of Earth offer you their 
duty. Commodore, and their grati- 
tude for liberation.” 

“Peace between our races.” 
“Peace,” echoed Skclling. 

Atark permitted himself to smile. 
“Earth,” he repeated. “Men of 
Earth. A word dies. Lakkuret exists 
no longer.” 

“Many words die,” Skclling .said 
quietly. “Surrint dies. The name of 
this city is London.” 

“London? I had not heard that. 
Lakkuret — you knew what that 
means, in our speech?” Skclling 
.shook his head. “It means Fair 
Haven. The Admiral of the First 
Fleet gave it that name. The 
Mirmi, in all their wanderings, had 
never found so lovely a world.” 
Skelling looked at him curiously. 
“But you never made any serious 
attempt to colonize it? Only troops 
— no settlers.” 

“There were to have been set- 

JOHN CHRISTOPHER 




I In s. But if our troops, under dis- 
( ipliiif, surcumbcd so quickly to 
lliis I'kiith” — he pronounced the 
word clumsily — “what would be- 
loiiir i>f settlers? The idea was 
iwvn abandoned; only postponed. 

And MOW . 

'‘.\nd now . ?” 

"Our first duty is to Mirma. The 
licet is reforming. Tomorrow we 
nMurn liome, to depose Mered.” 
“You can do that?” 

“Mirnii do not fight Mirmi,” 
At. irk replied, “in an unjust cause. 
'I'liat accomplished . many of us 
will wish to come back to Earth — 
as friends, as guests. We do not 
seek your good lands. Give us your 
deserts, and we will make thent 
bloom. Will you take us?” 

“I cannot speak finally until the 
Council has met,” Skelling said, 
"but I tliink you can take it the an- 
swer is yes; we shall be glad to 
have the Mirmi as friends.” 

“It is a lovely world,” Atark said 
wistfully. He stood up, stooping un- 
der his body’s greater weight. “We 
will leav'e now. We have much to 
do.” 

Skelling gestured towards the 
bound L.oki. “And Loki?” 

Atark looked at his fellow Mirm 
indifferently. “He is yours. 1 un- 
derstand your people hold him 
guilty of the death of the men of 
Tulinn, and perhaps of the death 
and destruction that followed. Do 
whatever is necessary.” 

After all these years, Skelling re- 
flected, lie still knew very little of 
Mirmi ]>sychology. “Mirmi do not 
fight Mirmi, except in a just cause.” 
But they abandon them. There was 
a curious logic in their minds, diffi- 
cult for men to grasp. The human 
mind was so much more flc.xible 

THE NAME OF THIS CITY 



and, he thought, more petty, 

Skelling said : “And should our 
decision be not death but banish- 
ment?” 

“Send him back to the fleet.” 
Atark smiled grimly. “But we shall 
be sur|jrised to see him.” 

When the Minni had gone, 
Skelling indie. ited Loki. He said to 
his men, "Untie him.” 

As they obeyed, one of them 
commented ; 

“That was a funny thing to say, 
President — about banishment. We 
know what the sentence will be.” 

Skelling answered softly; “No 
one know that, until it’s pro- 
nounced. You can go now.” 

They did not look very pleased 
about going. Loki glanced after 
them. 

“I prefer men when they aren’t 
exercising their unique talent for 
claptrap. Your followers arc quite 
right. We do know what the sen- 
tence will be. Behind the spurious 
liberalism your race has an odd vm- 
dictivcne.ss, cspcci.ally when acting 
in the mass.” 

“Perhaps.” Skelling looked at 
him. "Well? I told you we had 
won, even then.” 

“Not by your own qualities, by 
ours.” 

“A catalyst,” Skelling suggested, 
“to help the Mirmi on the right 
course.” 

Loki continued, “You are not 
childish enough to believe that, 
Skelling. Unless you regard defeat 
and decadence as the right course 
for the Mirmi.” 

“There can be no defeat in civil 
war. Why should there be deca- 
dence?” 

“Lakkuret,” Loki said. “Fair 
Haven. You will let the Mirmi 



71 




come here to settle. Noble gen- 
erosity — and meanwhile men will 
be voyaging through the stars, tak- 
ing the place of the Mirmi as rulers 
of the Mirmi empire.” 

“It might happen,” Skelling ad- 
mitted. “But by consent.” 

Loki said admiringly; “Nothing 
will stop men; they nave a h>’poc- 
risy which will win them the 
galaxy.” 

There was an irony in his voice 
which was different from the irony 
of defeat; it had an edge of satis- 
faction. It was difficult to imagine 
what Loki could have to be satis- 
fied about. His side had lost, his 
race he saw as foredoomed to lotus- 
eating exile, and his own life was 
forfeit. And yet there was satisfac- 
tion in his voice, ironic triumph. 

“You did your duty,” said Skell- 
ing. 

“I haven’t stopped doing so. 
The duty of a Mirm continues to 
death.” 

“There is not much you can do 
now.” 

“Duty has its negative side. The 
things not to do, as well as the 
things to do.” 

“A witness to the past greatness 
of the Mirmi?” 

“A witness for the prosecution,” 
Loki said, “not for the defence.” 

Skelling looked at him with ad- 
miration and some affection. 

“There will be no trial.” 

For the first time, Loki was 
thrown off balance. He looked un- 
certain. “You have no choice in 
that,” he said. 

“Our casualties numbered more 
than ten million. If there is a trial, 
there will be a verdict of guilty, 
and a sentence of death. It would 
be unfair, but that is what would 

72 



happen ... So I shall release you.” 
“Release? To what?” 

“To the fleet. You have your pa- 
trolship on the roof, and you can 
have my signature on a pardon.” 
Loki looked at him for some mo- 
ments without replying. 

“That would be a breach of your 
duty to your people.” 

Skelling nodded. “In a sense, yes. 
I don’t think it’s important.” 

“You would be deposed as Presi- 
dent.” 

“Possibly.” 

“Not possibly — certainly.” 
“Certainly, then. That’s not im- 
portant cither. There would be no 
pleasure in a presidency built on 
such a foundation.” 

“You are serious about this! You 
surprise me. More than that — I am 
corifused.” 

“I should waste no time,” said 
Skelling. “We have talked long 
enough. My men may get suspici- 
ous and come back. It may be im- 
possible for you to get away then.” 
“So there can be friendship,” 
Loki murmured, “between you and 
me, between man and Mirm.” 

“It was never my view. Sir Loki, 
that there could not be.” 

Skelling saw Loki come to a de- 
cision; his expression changed and 
he smiled. 

“I accept your offer — and I find 
that I can betray my duty, too, for 
friendship.” 

“Your duty — as a witness?” 
“More than that. Before he was 
deposed Admiral Besson sent me 
something — the Weapon.” 

Skelling felt horror crawl in his 
mind. It had been his over-riding 
fear, that the Mirmi might, in their 
desperation, use their ultimate 
weapon — the hydrogen chain-re- 

JOHN CHRISTOPHER 




action bomb — against the rebel 
planet. Activated, the earth’s at- 
mosphere would blaze, the world 
burn like a tinder. He saw now 
what Loki’s duty had been — the 
duty of keeping silence while the 
slow fuse burned. 

Loki went on, “It seemed to us 
that Earth had been a curse on the 
Mirmi, and that if it were de- 
stroyed the curse might lift. I don’t 
think that now and an)'way ... it 
doesn’t matter.’’ 

Skelling said urgently: “When is 
it set for?” 

“There’s time enough. Tomor- 
row morning. It was necessary’ to 
destroy the battle squadron along 
with the planet. It was that which 
was the hardest to bear, but there 
seemed to be no choice.” 

“And it’s . .” 

“On the roof. In my patrolship. 
Set to e.xplode pretnaturely if tam- 
pered with, of course.” 

“I’m c.xceptionally nervous,” 
Skelling said. “Shall we go up 
now?” 



S KELLING watched as Loki un- 
locked the fuse mechanism and 
put it out of action. Loki tossed the 



fuse away. He looked round, at the 
other roofs of the city and at the 
distant sunlit hills. 

“Surrint,” he said. “Goodbye, 
Surrint.” 

“Come back some time,” Skell- 
ing said. “Come back here to Lon- 
don.” 

“No. I shall not come back. But 
it is a lovely world. Perhaps for the 
Mirmi the einjiire is well lost.” 

“Lovely,” Skelling asked, “or 
corrupting?” 

“Both. Perhaps loveliness always 
corrupts. I never thought I would 
disobey instructions; and yet now 
it doesn't matter.” 

Loki stood by the door of the 
patrolship. ready to enter. “Re- 
member us,” he said. “Remember 
the Mirmi when your great shijss 
are probing the darkness beyond 
the galaxy.” 

“That will be after my time,” 
Skelling said. “I will remember you, 
Loki.” 

“And I, you.” 

The patrolship climbed into the 
blue sky towards the great poised 
shadows of the battle squadron. 
Skelling watched it out of sight. 
Then he went downstairs, to con- 
front outraged humanity. • • • 



DON'T BE SURPRISED If you sec a small moonlct with flashing liglits whizzing around 
the Earth one of these evenings. Scientists are urging the launching of a small 
50-pound moon now, instead of aiming at a “super-satellite.’’ It would flash across 
the sky for about three weeks and then gradually slow by friction and spiral down 
to Earth with its load of instruments. The “new look ’ in propo.scd satellites has 
been named “MOUSE”. The name stands not only for size, but for “Minimum 
Orbital Unmanned Satellite Earth.” 

AIRPLANE BODIES, boats, and automobiles in the future may be made of glass and

H e dropped over the stone 
wall and flattened to the 
ground. He looked warily about 
him like a young wolf, head down, 
eyes up. His name was Steven — 
but he’d forgotten that. His face 
was a sunburned, bitter, filthy 
elcvcn-ycar-old face —tight lips, 
lean cheeks, sharp blue eyes with 
startlingly clear whites. His clothes 
were rags — a pair of corduroy 
trousers without any knees : a man’s 
white shirt, far too big for him, full 
of holes, stained, recking with 
sweat ; a pair of dirty brown sneak- 
ers. 

He lay, knife in hand, and waited 
to sec if anyone had seen him com- 
ing over the wall or heard his al- 
most sesundlcss landing on the 
weedgrown dirt. 

,\bovc and behind him was the 
grey stone wall that ran along 
Central Park West all the way 
from Columbus Circle to the edge 
of Harlem. He had jumjaed over 
just north of 72nd Street. Here the 
park was considerably below street 
level — the wall was about three 
feet high on the sidewalk side and 
about nine feet high on the park 
side. From where he lay at the 
foot of the wall only the jagged, 
leaning tops of the shattered apart- 
ment buildings across the street 
were visible. Like the teeth of a 
skull’s smile they caught the late 
afternoon sunlight that drifted 
across the park. 

For five mimites Steven had 
knelt motionless on one of the 
cement benches on tlic other side 
of the wall, just the top of his 
head and his eyes protruding over 
the top. He had seen no one mov- 
ing in the park. Every few seconds 
he had looked up and down the 



74 





street behind him to make sure 
that no one was sneaking up on him 
that way. Once he had seen a man 
dart out halfway across the street, 
then wheel and vanish back into 
the rubble where one whole side 
of an apartment house had col- 
lapsed iii.o 68th Street. 

Steven knew the reason for that. 
A dozen blocks down the street, 
from around Columbus Circle, had 
come the distant hollow racket of a 
pack of dogs. 

Then he had jumped over the 
wall — partly because the dogs 



might head this way, partly because 
the best time to move was when 
you couldn’t see anyone else. Alter 
all, you could never be sure that 
no one was seeing you. You just 
moved, and then you waited to see 
if anything happened. If someone 
came at you, you fought. Or ran, 
if the other looked too dangerous. 

No one came at him this time. 
Only a few days ago he’d come 
into the park and two men had 
been hidden in the bushes a few 
yards from the wall. They’d been 
lying very still, and had covered 

Illustrated by Paul Orban 




themselves with leaves, so he hadn’t 
seen them; and they’d been look- 
ing the other way, waiting for 
someone to come along one of the 
paths or through the trees, so they 
hadn’t seen him looking over the 
wall. 

The instant he’d landed, they 
were up and chasing him, yelling 
that if he’d drop his knife and any 
food he had they’d let him go. He 
dropped the knife, becau.se he had 
others at home — and when they 
stopped to paw for it in the leaves, 
he got away. 

Now he got into a crouching 
position, very slowly. His nostrils 
dilated as he sniffed the breeze. 
Sometimes you knew men were 
near by their smell — the ones who 
didn’t stand outside when it rained 
and scrub the smell off them. 

He smelled nothing. He looked 
and listened some more, his blue 
eyes hard and bright. He saw noth- 
ing e.xcept trees, rocks, bushes, all 
crowded by thick weeds. He heard 
nothing except the movement of 
greenery in the afternoon breeze, 
the far off baying of the dog pack, 
the flutter of birds, the scamper of 
a squirrel. 

He whirled at the scamper. 
When he saw that it was a squir- 
rel, he licked his lips, almost tasting 
it. But it was too far away to kill 
with the knife, and he didn’t want 
to risk stoning it, because that 
made noise. You stoned squirrels 
only after you’d scouted all around, 
and even then it was dangerous — 
someone might hear you anyway 
and sneak up and kill you for the 
squirrel, or for anything else you 
had, or ju.st kill you — there were 
some men who did that. Not for 
guns or knives or food or anything 

76 



else that Steven could see . 
they just killed, and howled like 
dogs when they did it. He’d 
watched them. They were the men 
with the funny looks in their eyes 
— the ones who tried to get you to 
come close to them by pretending 
to offer you food or something. 

In a half-crouch Steven started 
moving deeper into the park, 
pausing each time he reached any 
cover to look around. He came to 
a long green slope and went down 
it soundlessly, stepping on rocks 
whenever he could. He crossed the 
weedgrown bridle path, darting 
from the shelter of a bush on one 
side to press against the trunk of a 
tree on the other. 

He moved so silently that he 
surprised another squirrel on the 
tree trunk. In one furious motion 
Steven had his knife out of his 
belt, and sliced it at the squirrel so 
fast the blade went tuhuh in the 
air — but the squirrel was faster. It 
scurried up out of reach, and the 
knife just clipped off the end of its 
tail. It went higher, and out onto 
a branch, and chittered at him. It 
was funny about squirrels — they 
didn’t seem to feel anything in their 
tails. Once he’d caught one that 
way, and it had twisted and run 
off, leaving the snapped-off tail in 
his hand. 

Dogs weren’t that way — once 
he’d fought a crippled stray from a 
pack, and he’d got it by the tail 
and swung it around and brained 
it on a lamppost. 

Dogs . squirrels . 



S TEVEN had some dim, almost 
dreamlike memory of dogs that 
acted friendly, dogs that didn’t 

HARRY NEAL 




roam the streets in packs and pull 
you down and tear you apart and 
eat you alive ; and he had a memory 
of the squirrels in the park being 
so tame that they’d eat right out 
of your hand . 

But that had been a long, long 
time ago — before men had started 
hunting squirrels, and sometimes 
dogs, for food, and dogs had started 
hunting men. 

Steven turned south and paral- 
leled the bridle path, going always 
wherever the cover was thickest, 
moving as silently as the breeze. He 
was going no place in particular — 
his purpose was simply to see some- 
one before that someone saw him, 
to see if the other had anything 
worth taking, and, if so, take it if 
possible. Also, he’d try to get a 
squirrel. 

Far ahead of him, across the 
bridle path and the half-mile or so 
of tree-clumped park that lay be- 
yond, was Central Park South — a 
sawtoothed ridge of grey-white rub- 
ble. And beyond that lay the ruin 
of midtown Manhattan. The bomb 
had exploded low over 34th Street 
and Seventh Avenue that night six 
years ago, and everything for a 
mile in every direction had been 
leveled in ten seconds. The crater 
started at around 26th and sloped 
down to where 34th had been and 
then up again to 40th, and it 
glowed at night. It wasn’t safe to 
go down around the crater, Steven 
knew. He’d heard some men talk- 
ing about it — they’d said that any- 
one who went there got sick ; some- 
thing would go wrong with their 
skin and their blood, and they’d 
start glowing too, and die. 

Steven had understood only part 
of that. The men had seen him and 



chased him. He’d gotten away, and 
since then had never ventured be- 
low Central Park South. 

It was a “war”, they’d said. He 
didn’t know much about that either 
. who was winning, or had won, 
or even if it was still being fought. 
He had only the vaguest notion of 
what a war was — it was some kind 
of fight, but he didn’t think it was 
over food. Someone had “bombed” 
the city — once he had heard a man 
call the city a “country” — and that 
was about as early as he could re- 
member anything. In his memory 
was the flash and roar of that night 
and, hours before that, cars with 
loud voices driving up and down 
the streets warning everybody to get 
out of the city because of the 
“war”. But Steven’s father had been 
drunk that night, lying on the 
couch in the living room of their 
apartment on the upper west side, 
and even the bomb hadn’t waked 
him up. The cars with the voices 
had waked Steven up; he’d gone 
back to sleep after a while, and 
then the bomb had waked him up 
again. He’d gone to the window 
and climbed out onto the fire es- 
cape, and seen the people running 
in the street, and listened to all the 
screaming and the steady rumble 
of still-falling masonry, and 
watched the people on foot trample 
each other and people in cars drive 
across the bodies and knock other 
people down and out of the way, 
and still other people jump on the 
cars and pull out the drivers and 
try to drive away themselves until 
someone pulled them out . 
Steven had watched, fascinated, be- 
cause it was more exciting than 
anything he’d ever seen, like a 
movie. Then a man had stood un- 

77 



LITTLE BOY 




der the fire escape, holding up his 
arms, and shouted up at Steven to 
jump for God’s sake, little boy, and 
that had frightened Steven and he 
went back inside. His father had al- 
ways told him never to play with 
strangers. 

Next afternoon Steven’s father 
had gotten up and gone downstairs 
to get a drink, and when he saw 
what had happened, he’d come 
back making choked noises in his 
throat and saying over and over 
again, “Everybody worth a damn 
got out . now it’s a jungle . 
all the scum left, like me — and the 
ones they hurt, like you, Stevie . .” 
He’d put some cans of food in a 
bag and started to take Steven out 
of the city, but a madman with a 
shotgun had blown the side of his 
head off before they’d gone five 
blocks. Not to get the food or any- 
thing . looting was going on all 
over, but there wasn’t any food 
problem yet . the man was just 
one of the ones who killed for no 
rea.son at all. There’d been a lot 
like that the first few weeks after 
the bomb, but most of them hadn’t 
lasted long — they wanted to die, it 
looked like, about as much as they 
wanted to kill. 

Steven had gotten away. He was 
five years old and small and fast on 
his feet, and the madman missed 
with the other barrel. 

Steven had fled like an animal, 
and since then had lived like one. 
He’d stayed away from the men, 
remembering how his father had 
looked with half a head — and be- 
cause the few times men had seen 
him, they’d chased him; either they 
were afraid he’d steal from them, 
or they wanted his knife or belt or 
something. Once or twice men had 

78 



shouted that they wouldn’t hurt 
him, they only wanted to help him 
— but he didn’t believe them. Not 
after seeing his father that way, and 
after the times they had tried to 
kill him. 

He watched the men, though, 
sneaking around their fires at night 
—sometimes because he was lonely 
and, later on, hoping to find scraps 
of food. He saw how they lived, 
and that was the way he lived too. 
He saw them raid grocery stores — 
he raided the stores after they left. 
He saw them carrying knives and 
guns — he found a knife and carried 
it; he hadn’t yet found a gun. They 
ran from the dogs; he learned to 
run from them, after seeing them 
catch a man once. The men raided 
other .stores, taking clothes and lots 
of things whose use Steven didn’t 
understand. Steven took some 
clothes at first, but he didn’t care 
much about what he wore — both 
his shirt and his heavy winter coat 
had come from dead men. He 
found toy stores, and had a lot of 
toys. The men collected and 
hoarded wads of green paper, and 
sometimes fought and killed each 
other over it. Steven vaguely re- 
membered that it was called 
“money’’, and that it was very im- 
portant. He found it too, here and 
there, in dead men’s pockets, in 
boxes with sliding drawers in stores 
— but he couldn’t find any use for 
it, so his hoard of it lay hidden in 
the hole in the floor under the pile 
of blankets that was his bed. 

Eventually he saw the men begin 
to kill for food, when food became 
scarce. When that happened — the 
food scarcity, and the killing — 
many of the men left the city, 
going across the bridges and 

HARRY NEAL 




through the tunnels under the 
rivers, heading for the “country”. 

He didn’t follow them. The city 
was all he’d ever known. 

He stayed. Along with the men 
who said they’d rather stay in the 
city where there was still plenty 
of food for those who were willing 
to hunt hard and sometimes kill 
for it, and, in addition, beds to 
sleep in, rooms for protection from 
the weather and dogs and other 
men, all tlie clothes you could wear, 
and lots of otlier stuff just lying 
around for the taking. 

He stayed, and so he learned to 
kill, when necessary, for his food. 
He had si.\ knive.s, and with them 
he’d killed men higher than he 
could count. He was good at hid- 
ing — in trees, in hallways, behind 
bushes, under cars — and he was 
small enough to do a good job of 
trailing when he saw somebody who 
looked as though they were carry- 
ing food in their pockets or in the 
bags almost everyone carried. And 
he knew where to strike with the 
knife. 

His home was the rubble of an 
apartment building just north of 
Columbus Circle, on Broadway. No 
one else lived there; only he knew 
the way through the broken cor- 
ridors and fallen walls and piles of 
stone to his room on the seventh 
floor. Every day or so he went out 
into the park — to get food or any- 
thing at all he could get that he 
wanted. He was still looking for a 
gun. Food was the main thing, 
though; he had lots of cans up in 
his room, but he’d heard enough of 
the men’s talk to know that it was 
wise to use them only when you 
didn’t have anything else, and get 
what you could day by day. 

LITTLE BOY 



And, of course, there was water 
— when it didn’t rain or snow for 
a while, he had to get water from 
the lakes in the park. 

That was hard sometimes. You 
could go two or three days with- 
out water, even if you went to one 
of the lakes and stayed hidden 
there all day, because it might be 
that long before a moment came 
when no one was near enough to 
kill you when you made your dash 
from the bushes and filled your 
pail and dashed back. There were 
more skeletons around the lakes 
than anyplace. 

T he dogs were coming up 
Central Park West. Their racket 
bounced off the broken buildings 
lining the street, and came down 
into the park, and even the squir- 
rels and birds were quieter, as if not 
wanting to attract attention. 

Steven froze by the bole of a tree, 
ready to climb if the dogs came 
over the wall at him. He’d done 
that once before. You climbed up 
and waited while the dogs danced 
red-eyed beneath you, until they 
heard or smelled someone else, .ind 
then they were off, bounding 
hungrily after the new quarry. 
They’d learned that men in trees 
just didn’t come down. 

The dogs passed the point in the 
park where Steven waited. He knew 
from the sound that they weren’t 
after anybody — just prowling. The 
howls and snarls and scratchy 
sounds of nails on concrete faded 
slowly. 

Steven didn’t move until they 
were almost inaudible in the dis- 
tance. 

Then, when he did move, he 

79 




took only one step — and froze 
again. 

Someone was coming toward 
him. 

Just a shadow of a motion, a 
whisper of sound, a breath — some- 
one was coming along the path on 
the other side of the bushes. 

Steven’s lips curled back to re- 
veal decayed teeth. He brought out 
his knife from his belt and stood 
utterly still, waiting for the steps 
to go on so he could trail along be- 
hind his quarry, off to one side, 
judging the other’s stature from 
glimpses through the bushes, and 
ascertaining whether he was carry- 
ing anything worth killing him for. 

But the footsteps didn’t pass. 
They stopped on the other side of 
the bushes. Then leaves rustled as 
whoever it was bent to come 
through the bushes. Steven hugged 
his tree trunk, and saw a short thin 
figure coming toward him through 
the green leaves, a bent-over figure. 
He raised the knife, started to bring 
its point down in the .short arc that 
would end in the back of the other’s 
neck . 

He dropped the knife. 

Wide-eyed, not breathing, he 
stared at her. 

Knife in hand, its point aimed at 
his belly, she stared back. 

She was dressed in a man’s 
trousers, tom off at the ankles, and 
a yellow blouse that might have be- 
longed to her mother, and new- 
looking shoes she must have found, 
or killed for, only a week or so ago. 
Her face was as sunburned and 
dirty as his. 

A squirrel chittered over their 
heads as they stared at each other. 

Steven noted expertly that she 
seemed to be carrying no food and 

80 



had no gun. No one with a gun 
would carry a drawn knife. 

She still held the knife ready, 
though the point had drooped. She 
moistened her lips. 

He wondered if .she would attack. 
He obviously didn’t have any food 
either, so maybe she wouldn’t. But 
if she did— well, she was only a little 
larger than he was; he could prob- 
ably kill her with her own knife, 
though he might even get his osvn 
knife from the ground before she 
got to him. 

But it was a woman, he knew . 
without knowing exactly what a 
woman was, or how he knew. The 
hair was long — but then, some of 
the men’s hair was long too. It was 
something different — something 

about the face and body. He hadn’t 
seen many women, and certainly 
never one as little as this, but he 
knew that’s what it was. A woman. 

Once he’d seen some men kill 
another man who’d killed a woman 
for her food. By their angry shouts 
he knew that killing a woman was 
different somehow. 

And he remembered a woman. 
And a word : mother. A face and a 
word, a voice and a warmth and a 
not-sour body smell . she was 
dead. He didn’t remember who had 
killed her. Somehow he thought 
she had been killed before every- 
thing changed, before the “bomb” 
fell; but he couldn’t remember very 
well, and didn’t know how .she’d 
been killed or even why people had 
killed each other in tho.se days . 
Not for food, he thought; he could 
remember having plenty to eat. 
Another word: cancer. His father 
had said it about hb mother. May- 
be somebody had killed her to get 
that, instead of food. Anyway,

somebody had killed her, because 
she was dead, and people didn’t 
just die. 

Seeing a woman, and such a 
little one ... it had startled him 
so much he had dropped his knife. 

But he could sull kill her if he 
had to. 

She stirred, her eyes wide on his. 
She moved just an inch or so. 

Steven crouched, almost too fast 
to see, and his knife was in his 
hand, ready from this position to 
get in under her stab and cut her 
belly open. 

She made a strangled sound and 
shook her head. 

Steven pulled his swing, without 
quite knowing why. He struck her 
knife out of her hand with his 
blade, and it went spinning into the 
leaves. 

He took a step toward her, lips 
curled back. 

She retreated two steps, and her 
back was against a tree trunk. 

He came up to her and stood 
with his knife point pressing into 
her belly just above where the 
blouse entered the man’s pants. 

She whimpered and shook her 
head and whimpered again. 

He scowled at her. Looked her 
up and down. She was wearing a 
tarnished ring on her right hand, 
with a stone that sparkled. He 
liked it. He decided to kill her. He 
pressed the knifepwint harder, and 
twisted. 

She said, “Little boy — ’’ and 
started to cry. 

Memories assailed Steven; 

Jump for God’s sake, little boy 

Distrust. Kill her. 

My little boy . my son. 

82 



His knifepoint wavered. He 
scowled. 

Don’t run away, little boy — we 
won’t hurt you. , . 

Kill. 

Tears were rolling down her 
cheeks. 

My son, my baby . I’m crying 
because I have to go away for a 
long time . 

Steven stepped back. She was 
weaponless, and a woman — what- 
ever that was. 

Leaves rustled. Steven and the 
girl froze motionless. 

It was only a squirrel in the 
bushes. 

He bent silently, looked around 
under the leafy green bushes that 
surrounded them, almost at ground- 
Icvel. If there had been men near- 
by, he could have seen their legs. 
He saw nothing. He kept one eye 
on the girl as he bent. She wasn’t 
crying, now that he’d taken the 
knife away. She was watching him 
and rubbing her belly where he’d 
pressed it. 

When he straightened, she took 
a step aw'ay from the tree, moving 
as silently as he ever had. Suddenly 
she stooped to pick up her knife, 
made a slashing motion at the 
ground with it, looked up at him. 

He was in mid-air. On her. She 
flattened beneath him with a 
squeal. She was stronger than he 
was, and e.\perienced. She brought 
her knife back over her shoulder, 
and if he hadn’t ducked his head 
it would have laid his face op>en. 
When she brought it down for 
another try, he clublred the back 
of her hand with the hilt of his 
knife, and she gasp>ed and dropp>ed 
it. 

Astride her, he raised his knife 
HARRY NEAL 




to kill her. She was pointing with 
her left hand, frantically, at some- 
thing that lay on the ground beside 
them, and saying, “No, no, little 
boy, no, no — ’’ Then she just 
whimpered, knowing that his knife 
was poised, and kept stabbing her 
finger at the ground. Because she 
was helpless, he paused, looked, 
and saw a st]uirrel lying there, head 
bleeding. 

He understood. She hadn’t been 
trying to kill him. She had seen the 
squirrel, and gotten it. 

He decided to kill her anyway. 
For the squirrel. 

“No, little boy—” 

He hesitated. 

“Friends, little boy . 

After a moment he rolled off her. 

She sat up, cheeks tear-streaked. 
She pointed at the squirrel, then at 
Steven, and shook her head vio- 
lently. 

Knife threatening her, he 
reached out to pick up the squirrel. 

Mine, the knife said. 

At that point the squirrel, which 
had been only momentarily stunned 
by her blow, shook itself and 
scrambled for the bushes. His hand 
missed it by inches. He lunged for 
it, flat on his belly, and caught its 
tail with one hand. 

As another squirrel’s tail had 
done long ago, this one broke off. 

He lay there for a moment, 
.snarling, the tail in his hand; and 
when he turned over, the girl had 
her knife in her hand and her 
teeth were bared at him. 

Blue eyes blazing, he got to his 
feet, expecting her to attack any 
second. He dropped the tail. He 
crouched to fight. 

She didn’t attack. 

Nor, for some reason, did he. 

LITTLE BOY 



The way her chapped lips were 
stretched back over her teeth dis- 
turbed him ... or rather it un- 
settled him, because it didn’t disturb 
him. At least not the way a snarl 
did. It didn’t put him on guard, 
every muscle tense; it didn’t make 
him feel that he had to fight. She 
didn't look angry or eager to have 
anything he had or ready to kill 
. he didn’t know the word for 
how she looked. 

She weighed her knife in her 
hand. Then she struck it in her belt, 
and said again, “Friends, little 
boy.’’ 

He stared. At her strange snarl 
that wasn’t a snarl. At the knife 
she had put away. He had never 
seen anyone do that before. 

Slowly he felt his own lips curl 
back into an expression he could 
hardly remember. He felt the way 
he felt sometimes late at night 
when, safe and alone in his room, 
he would play a little with his toys. 
He didn’t feel like killing her any 
more. He left like . like friends. 

He looked at the squirrel tail 
lying on the ground. He worried 
it with a foot, then kicked it away. 
It wa.sn’t good to eat — and he 
thought of how the squirrel had 
looked scrambling off, and felt his 
lips stretch tighter. 

He tried to think of the word. 
Finally it came. 

“Funny squirrel,” he said, 
through his tight lips. 

He stuck his knife in his belt. 

They stared at each other, feel- 
ing each other’s pleasure at the 
peacemaking. 

She bent, picked up a small 
stone and flipped it at him. He 
made no attempt to catch it, and it 
struck him on the hip. He half- 

83 




crouched, instantly wary, hand on 
knife. A thrown stone had only 
one meaning. 

But she was still smiling, and she 
shook her head. “No, little boy,” 
she said. "Play.” She tossed an- 
other stone, high in the air. 

He reached out and caught it as 
it descended. 

He started to toss it back to her, 
and remembered only at the last 
moment not to hurl it at her head. 

He tossed it, and she missed it. 

He grinned at her. 

She tossed another one back at 
him, and he missed, and they both 
grinned. 

Then he grunted, remembering 
something from the dim past. He 
picked up a small fallen branch 
from the ground. 

When he looked up, she was 
poised to run. 

This time he shook his head, 
waving the stick gently. “Play,” he 
said. 

She threw another stone, eyes 
warily on the stick. He swung, 
missed. 

He hit the next one, and 
the sharp crack, and the noise the 
stone made rattling off into 
the bushes, flattened him to the 
ground, eyes searching for sign of 
men. 

She was beside him. He smelled 
her body and her breath. 

They saw no one. 

He looked at her lying beside 
him. She was grinning again. 

Then she laughed; and, without 
knowing what he was doing or 
why — he could hardly remember 
ever doing it before — he laughed 
too. 

It felt good. Like the snarl that 
wasn’t a snarl, only better. It 

84 



seemed to come from way inside. 
He laughed again, sitting up. He 
laughed a third time, tight hesitant 
sounds that came out of his throat 
and stretched his lips until they 
wouldn’t stretch any more. 

Tears were on his cheeks, and he 
was laughing very tightly, very 
steadily, and she was laughing the 
same way, and they lay that way 
for a few minutes until they were 
trembling and their stomachs 
ached, and the laughter was almost 
crying. 

He saw her face, so close by, and 
felt an impulse. He rolled over and 
started to scuffle with her. When 
she realized that he wasn’t trying 
to kill her, that he was playing, 
she scuffled back, rubbing his face 
in the dirt harder than he had 
hers, because she was stronger. 

He spat dirt and grass and 
grinned at her, and they fell apart. 

Footsteps. 

IS KNIFE was out and ready, 
and so was hers. 

Legs moved on the other side of 
the bushes, stopped. 

Silently, almost stepping between 
the leaves on the gi'ound, Steven 
and the girl crawled out the other 
side of the bushes and took up 
positions against treetrunks, just 
enough of their heads protruding 
to see around. 

A man came probing into the 
head-high bushes from the path 
side . stood there a moment 
looking around, only a vague 
brown shape through the leaves. 

He grunted, went out to the path 
again, walked on. 

Steven and the girl followed him 
by his sounds, trailing about twenty 

HARRY NEAL 





feet behind, until Steven got a good 
look at him when he passed an 
open space between the bushes. 

He was a big man in brownish- 
green clothes — new-looking clothes, 
not full of holes. He walk^ almost 
carelessly, as if he didn’t care who 
heard him. 

And Steven saw the reason for 
that. 

Men with guns always walked 
louder. This man wore a bolstered 
gun at his belt, and carried another 
one — a long gun something like a 
rifle, only bulkier. 

Steven’s lips curled. He darted a 
look at the girl. Across his mind 
flashed the vague idea of sharing 
whatever the man had with her, 
but he didn’t know how to let her 
know. 

She was looking at the guns, 
eyes wide. Afraid. She shook her 
head. 

Steven snarled silently at her, 
put a hand on her chest, shoved 
gently. 

She stayed there as he moved 
on. 

Silently he drifted from tree to 
tree, bush to bush, getting ahead 
of his quarry. The big man’s shoes 
clumped noisily along. Steven had 
no trouble telling where he was. 

At last Steven spotted a good 
tree a thick-foliaged one about 
forty feet up the path, where the 
sun would be in the man’s eyes. 

If the man kept following the 
path — 

He did. 

And when he passed below the 
tree, Steven was waiting on the low 
branch that overhung the path — 
waiting with his face taut and his 
eyes staring and his knife ready. 
One stab at the base of the skull, 

LITTLE BOY 



and the guns would be his. 

He jumped. 

They brought them into the 
camp. By this time Steven and the 
girl had found that their captors 
were far too strong and too many 
to escape from, and quite adept at 
protecting themselves from the 
foulest of blows. But still the two 
of them struggled now and then, 
panting like animals. 

Everything at the camp, which 
was over on Long Island, near 
Flushing Bay, was neat and trim 
and olive-drab, and it was almost 
evening now, and as the jeep 
rolled up the avenue between the 
rows of tents Steven and the girl 
stopped struggling to blink at the 
first artificial lights they’d seen in 
a very long time. 

In the lieutenant’s tent, the big 
man Steven had tried to kill said 
to the man behind the desk, “Like 
a jaguar, sir. Right out of the tree 
he came. I had him spotted, of 
course, but he did a peach of a job 
of trailing me. If I hadn’t been 
ready for him. I’d be a dogtag.” 

The lieutenant looked at Steven 
and the girl, standing before him, 
and the four soldiers who stood 
behind them, one to each strong 
dirty young arm. 

“The others got the girl, eh?” he 
said. 

“Yessir. When we first heard 
’em, I started making enough noise 
to cover the rest of the boys.” The 
sergeant grinned. “I swear, he came 
at me as neat as any commando 
ever did.” 

“God.” said the lieutenant, and 
closed his eyes for a moment. 
“What a thing. Let this war be 
the last one, Sipich. So this is what 

85 




happened to New York in six years. 
Maniacs. Murderers. Worst of all, 
wolf-children. And the rest of the 
country . .” 

“Well, we’re back now, sir. We 
can start putting it all back to- 
gether — ’’ 

“God,” said the lieutenant again. 
“Do you think the pieces will fit?” 
He looked at Steven. “What is your 
name, son?” 

Steven snarled. 

“Take them away,” said the 
lieutenant wearily. “Feed them. 
Delouse them. Send them to the 
Georgia camp.” 

“They’ll be okay, sir. In a year 
or so they’ll be smiling all over the 
place, taking an interest in things. 
Kids arc kids, sir.” 

"Are they? These kids, Sipich? 
. I don’t know. I just don’t 



know.” 

The sergeant gave an order, and 
the four soldiers urged Steven and 
the girl out of the tent. There was 
a bleat of pain as one of the 
children placed a kick. 

The sergeant started to follow 
his men out. At the tent flaps he 
paused. “Sir . maybe you’d like 
to know: we found these two be- 
cause they were playing and laugh- 
ing. We were scouting the park, 
and heard them laughing.” 

“They were?” said the lieuten- 
ant, looking up from the forms he 
was Ailing out. “Playing?” 

“It’s still there, sir. Deep down. 
It has to be.” 

“I sec,” said the lieutenant slow- 
ly. “Yes, I suppose it is. And now 
we’ve got to dig it up.” 

“Well ... we buried it, sir.” • • •

MIRACLE BY PRICE 



They said old Doctor Price was an inventive genius 
but no miracle worker. Yet — if he 
didn’t work miracles in behalf of an over-worked 
little guy named Cupid, what was he doing?. 



BY IRVING E. COX, JR. 



MEMO to: Clayton, Croyden and 

Hammeistead, Attorneys, 
attention: William Clayton 
from: Walter Gordon 

Dear Bill: 

Enclosed is the itemized inven- 
tory of the furnishings of the late 
Dr. Edward Price’s estate. As you 
requested, I personally examined 
the laboratory. Candidly, Bill, you 
needed a psychiatrist for the job, 
not a graduate physicist. Dr. Price 
was undoubtedly an inventive 
genius a decade ago when he was 
still active in General Electronics, 
but his lab was an embarrassing 



example of senile clutter. 

You had an idea. Bill, that be- 
fore he died Price might have been 
playing around with a new inven- 
tion which the estate could develop 
and patent. I found a score of 
gadgets in the lab, none of them 
finished and none of them built for 
any functional purpose that I could 
discover. 

Only two seemed to be com- 
pleted. One resembled a small, 

portable radio. It was a plastic case 
with two knobs and a two-inch 
speaker grid. There was no cord 

outlet. The machine may have 

been powered by batteries, for 1 

87 




heard a faint humming when I 
turned the knobs. Nothing else. Dr. 
Price had left a handwritten card 
on the box. He intended to call it 
a Semantic-Translator, but he had 
noted that the word combination 
was awkward for commercial ex- 
ploitation, and I suppose he held 
up a patent application until he 
could think of a catchier name. 
One sentence on that card would 
have amused you, Bill. Price wrote, 
“Should wholesale for about three- 
fifty per unit.” Even in his dotage, 
he had an eye for profit. 

The Semantic-Translator — what- 
ever that may mean — might have 
had possibilities. I fully intended to 
take it back with me to General 
Electronics and examine it thor- 
oughly. 

The second device, which Price 
had labeled a Transpositor, was 
large and rather fragile. It was a 
hollow cylinder of very small wires, 
perhaps a foot in diameter, fas- 
tened to an open-faced console 
crowded with a weird conglomera- 
tion of vacuum tubes, telescopic 
lenses and mirrors. The cylinder of 
wires was so delicate that the mo- 
tion of my body in the laboratory 
caused it to quiver. Standing in 
front of the wire coil were two 
brass rods. A kind of shovel-like 
chute was fixed to one rod (Price 
called it the shipping board). At- 
tached to the second rod was a 
long-handled pair of tongs which 
he called the grapple. 

The Transpositor was, I think, 
an outgrowth of Price’s investiga- 
tion of the relationship between 
light and matter. You may recall. 
Bill, the brilliant technical papers 
he wrote on that subject when he 
was stiU working in the laboratories 

88 



of General Electronics. At the time 
Price was considered something of 
a pioneer. He believed that light 
and matter were different forms of 
the same basic element; he said 
that eventually science would learn 
how to change one into the other. 

I seriously believe that the 
Transpositor was meant to do pre- 
cisely that. In other words. Price 
had expected to transpose the 
atomic structure of solid matter 
into light, and later to reconstruct 
the original matter again. Now 
don’t assume. Bill, that Price was 
wandering around in a senile delu- 
sion of fourth dimensional non- 
sense. The theory may be sound. 
Our present knowledge of the 
physical world makes the basic 
structure of matter more of a mys- 
tery than it has ever been. 

Not that I think Price achieved 
the miracle. Even in his most bril- 
liant and productive period he 
could not have done it. As yet our 
accumulation of data is too incom- 
plete for such an experiment. I be- 
lieve that Price created no more 
than a very reali.stic illusion with 
his arrangement of lenses and mir- 
rors. 

I saw the illusion, too; I used the 
machine. 

There were two dials on the 
front of the console. One was let- 
tered “time”, and the other “dis- 
tance”. The “time” dial could be 
set for eons, centuries or hours, de- 
pending upon the position of a 
three-way switch beneath it; the 
“distance” dial could be adjusted 
to light years, thousand-mile units, 
or kilometers by a similar device. 
Since there was no indication 
which p>osition would produce what 
results, I left the dials untouched. 

IRVING E. COX, JR. 




I plugged the machine into an elec- 
tric outlet and pushed the starter 
button. The coil of wire blazed 
with light and the chute slid rapid- 
ly in and out of the cylinder. 

That was all, at first. The starter 
button was labeled “the shipper”, 
and I gathered that Price had 
visualized the practical application 
of tlie Transpositor as a device for 
transporting goods from one point 
to another. 

I looked around the lab for 
something I could put into the 
chute. There was a card, written in 
red, warning me not to load be- 
yond the dimensional limits of the 
chute. The only thing I saw that 
was small enough was the little 
radio-like gadget Price had called a 
Semantic-Translator. Loaded hori- 
zontally, it just barely fit the chute. 

I pushed the shipper button a 
second time. Again there was a 
blaze of light, brighter than before, 
which temporarily blinded me. For 
a moment I saw the Semantic- 
Translator in the heart of the 
fragile, wire cylinder. It had the 
glow of molten steel, pouring from 
a blast furnace. 

Then it was gone. The chute 
shot back to the front of the ma- 
chine. The tray was empty. 

Was it an illusion? I believe that, 
Bill, because later on, when I 
thought of using the grapple. 



ISS Bertha Kent walked back 
the gravel trail from the dress- 
ing room. The early morning sun 
was bright and warm, but she held 
her woolen robe tight across her 
throat. She tried to avoid looking 
at the other camps — at the sleepy- 
eyed women coming out of tents, 

MIRACLE BY PRICE 



and the men starting morning fires 
in the stone rings. 

Bitterness was etched in acid in 
her soul. She made herself believe 
it was because she hated Yosemitc. 
The vacation had been such a dis- 
appointment. She had expected so 
much and — as usual — it had all 
gone wrong. 

Her hope had been so high when 
school closed; this year was going 
to be different! 

“Are you going anywhere this 
summer?” Miss Emmy asked after 
the last faculty meeting in June. 

“To Yosemite for a couple of 
weeks, I think.” 

“The Park’s always crowded. 
You ought to meet a nice man up 
there, Bertha.” 

“I’m not interested in men,” 
Miss Kent had replied frostily. 
“I’m a botany teacher and it helps 
me professionally if I spend part of 
the summer observing the phe- 
nomenon of nature.” 

“Don’t kid me, Bertha. You can 
drop the fancy lingo, too; school’s 
out. You want a man as much as I 
do.” 

That was true. Miss Kent admit- 
ted — in the quiet of her own mind. 
Never aloud ; never to anyone else. 
Six years ago, when Bertha Kent 
had first started to teach, she had 
been optimistic about it. She 
wanted to marry; she wanted a 
family of her own — instead of 
wasting her lifetime in a high 
school classroom playing baby sit- 
ter for other people’s kids. She had 
saved her money for all sorts of 
exotic summer vacations — tours, 
cruises, luxury hotels — but some- 
how something always went wrong. 

To be sure, she had met men. 
She was pretty; she danced well; 

89 





she was never prudish; she liked 
the out-of-doors. All positive qual- 
ities: she knew that. The fault lay 
always with the men. When she 
first met a stranger, everything was 
fine. Then, slowly. Miss Kent be- 
gan to see his faults. Men were sim- 
ply adult versions of the muscle- 
bound knot-heads the administra- 
tion loaded into her botany classes. 

Bertha Kent wanted something 
better, an ideal she had held in her 
mind since her childhood. The 
dream-inan was real, too. She had 
met him once and actually talked 
to him when she was a child. She 
couldn’t remember where; she 
couldn’t recall his face. But the 
qualities of his personality she 
knew as she did her own heart. If 
they had existed once in one man, 
she would find them again, some- 
where. That was the miracle she 
prayed for every summer. 

She thought the miracle had 
happened again when she first 
came to Yosemite. 

She found an open campsite by 
the river. While she was putting up 
her tent, the man from the camp 
beside hers came to help. At first 
he seemed the prototype of every- 
thing she hated — a good-looking, 
beautifully co-ordinated physical 
specimen, as sharp-witted as a jelly- 
fish. The front of his woolen shirt 
hung carelessly unbuttoned. She 
saw the mat of dark hair on his 
chest, the sculpted curves of sun- 
tanned muscle. No doubt he con- 
sidered himself quite attractive. 

Then, that evening after the fire- 
fall, the young man asked her to go 
with him to the ranger’s lecture at 
Ccunp Curry. Bertha discovered 
that he was a graduate physicist, 
employed by a large, commercial 

90 



laboratory. They had at least the 
specialized area of science in com- 
mon. By the time they returned 
from the lecture, they were calling 
each other by first names. The next 
day Walt asked her to hike up the 
mist trail with him to Nevada Falls. 

The familiar miracle began to 
take shafje. She lay awake a long 
time that night, looking at the 
dancing pattern of stars visible 
through the open flap of her tent. 
This was it; Walt was the reality of 
her dream. She made herself forget 
that every summer for six years the 
same thing had happened. She al- 
ways believed she had found her 
miracle; and always something 
happened to destroy it. 

For two days the idyll lasted. 
The inevitable awakening began 
the afternoon they drove along the 
Wawona highway to see the Mari- 
posa Grove of giant sequoias. They 
left their car in the parking area 
and walked through the magnifi- 
cent stand of cathedral trees. The 
trail was steep and sometimes 
treacherous. Twice Walt took her 
arm to help her. For some reason 
that annoyed her; finally she told 
him, 

“I’m quite able to look after my- 
self, Walt.” 

“So you’ve told me before.” 

“After all. I’ve been hiking most 
of my life. I know exactly what, to 
do—” 

“There isn’t much you can’t take 
care of for yourself, is there, 
Bertha?” His voice was suddenly 
very cold. 

“I’m not one of these rattle- 
brained chnging vines, if that’s 
what you mean. I detest a woman 
who is always yelping to a man for 
help.” 



IRVING E. COX, JR. 




“Independence is one thing, 
Bertha; I like that in a woman. But 
somehow you make a man feel 
totally inadequate. You set yourself 
up as his superior in everything.” 

“That’s nonsense, Walt. I’m 
quite ready to grant that you know 
a good deal more about physics 
than I do.” 

“Say it right, Bertha. You re- 
spect tlie fact that I hold a PhD.” 
He smiled. “That isn’t the same 
thing as res]jecting me for a per- 
.son. I knew you didn’t need my 
help on the trail, but it was a nor- 
mal courtesy to offer it. It seems to 
me it would be just as normal fur 
you to areejjt it. Little things like 
that are important in relations be- 
tween people.” 

“Forget it. Walt.^’ She slipped 
her hand through his. “There, see? 
I’ll do it just the way you want.” 

She was determined not to quar- 
rel over anything so trivial, though 
what he said seemed ehildish and 
it tarnished the dream a little. But 
the rest was still good; the miracle 
could still happen. 

Yet, in sj)ite of all her effort, they 
disagreed twice more before they 
left the Mariposa Grove. Bertha 
began to see Walt as he was; bril- 
liant, no doubt, in the single area 
of physii al science, but basically no 
difl'erent from any other man. She 
desperately wished that she could 
love him ; she earnestly wished that 
the ideal, fixed so long in her mind, 
might be destroyed. 

But slowly she saw the miracle 
slip away from her. That night, 
after the fire-fall, Walt did not ask 
her to go with him to the lecture. 
Miserable and angry, Bertha Kent 
went into her tent, but not to sleep. 

She lay staring at the night sky, 

MIRACLE BY PRICE 



and thinking how ugly the pin- 
point lights of distant suns were on 
the velvet void. As the hours 
passed, she heard the clatter of 
pans and voices as people at the 
other campsites retired. She heard 
Walt when he returned, whistling 
tunelessly. He banged around for 
nearly an hour in the camp ni.'xt to 
hers. He dropped a stack of pans; 
he overturned a box of food; he 
tripped over a tent line. She won- 
dered if he were drunk. Had their 
(juarreling driven him to that? 
Walt must have lov( d her, then. 

After a time all the Coleman lan- 
terns in the camp were out. Still 
Bertha Kent did not sleep. The 
acid gri(‘f and bitt<-rness tormented 
her with the ghost of another fail- 
ure, another shattered dream. She 
listened to the soft music of the 
flowing stream, the gentle whisper 
of summer wind in the pines, but 
it gave her no peace. 

Suddenlv she heard quiet foot- 
steps and the crackling of twigs be- 
hind her tent. She was terrified. It 
must he Walt. If he had come 
home drunk, he could have 
planned almost anv kind of vio- 
lence by way of revenge. 

The footsteps moved rinser. 
Bertha shook ofT the paralysis of 
fear and reached for her electric 
lantern. She flashed the beam into 
the darkness. She saw the black 
bulk of a bear who was pawing 
through her food box. 

She was so relieved she forgot 
that a bear might also be a legiti- 
mate cause of fear. She ran from 
the tent, swinging tlie light and 
shooing the animal away as she 
would have chased a puppy. The 
bear swung toward her, roaring 
and clawing at the air. She backed 

91 




away. The bear swung its paws 
again, and her food box shattered 
on the ground, in a crescendo of 
sound. 

Bertha heard rapid footsteps un- 
der the pines. In the pale moon- 
light she saw Walt. He was wear- 
ing only a pair of red-striped boxer 
shorts. He was swinging his arms 
and shouting, but the noise of the 
falling box had already frightened 
the bear away. 

Walt stood in the moonlight, 
smiling foolishly. 

“I guess I came too late,” he 
said. 

‘‘I’m quite sure the bear would 
have left of its own accord, Walt. 
They’re always quite tame in the 
national parks, you know.” As soon 
as she said it, she knew it was a 
mistake. Even though he had done 
nothing, it would have cost her lit- 
tle to thank him. The words had 
come instinctively; she hadn’t 
thought how her answer would 
affect him. Walt turned on his heel 
stiffly and walked back to his tent. 

With a little forethought — a lit- 
tle kindness — Bertha might even 
then have rescued her miracle. She 
knew that. She knew she had lost 
him now, for good. For the first 
time in her life she saw the dream 
as a barrier to her happiness, not 
an ideal. It held her imprisoned; it 
gave her nothing in exchange. 

She slept fitfully for the rest of 
the night. As soon as the sun was 
up, she pulled on her woolen robe 
and went to the dressing room to 
wash. She walked back along the 
gravel path, averting her eyes from 
the other camps and the men 
hunched over the smoking break- 
fast fires. She hated Yosemite. She 
hated all the people crowded 

92 



around her. She had made up her 
mind to pack her tent and head for 
home. This was just another vaca- 
tion lost, another year wasted. 

She went into her tent and put 
on slacks and a bright, cotton 
blouse. Then she sat disconsolate at 
her camp table surveying the mess 
the bear had made of her food box. 
There was nothing that she could 
rescue. She could drive to the vil- 
lage for breakfast, but the shops 
wouldn’t open for another hour. 

Behind her she heard Walt start- 
ing his Coleman stove. Yesterday 
he would have offered her break- 
fast ; now he’d ignored her. All 
along the stream camp fires were 
blazing in the stone rings. Bertha 
wondered if she could ask the cou- 
ple on the other side of her camp- 
site for help. They had attempted 
to be friendly once before, and 
Bertha hadn't responded with a 
great deal of cordiality. They 
weren’t the type she liked — a frizzy- 
headed, coarse-voiced blonde, and 
a paunchy old man who hadn’t 
enough sense to know what a fool 
he looked parading around camp 
in the faded bathing trunks he 
wore all day. 

Suddenly a light flashed in 
Bertha’s face. A metal shovel slid 
out of nothingness and deposited a 
tiny, rectangular box on the table. 
For a long minute she stared at the 
box stupidly, vaguely afraid. Her 
mind must be playing her tricks. 
Such things didn’t happen. 

She reached out timidly and 
touched the box. It seemed real 
enough. A miniature radio of some 
sort, with a two-inch speaker. She 
turned the dials. She heard a faint 
humming. 

The coarse-voiced blonde came 
IRVING E. COX, JR. 




toward the table. 

“We just heard what happened 
last night, Miss Kent,” she said. 
“Me and George. About the bear, 
1 mean.” 

Bertha forced a .smile. “It made 
rather a shambles, didn’t it?” 

“Gee, you can't make breakfast 
out of a mess like this. \Vhy don’t 
you come and eat with us?” 

The blonde went on talking, 
apologizing for what she was serv- 
ing and at the same time listing it 
with a certain pride. Strangely, 
Miss Kent heard not one voice, but 
two. The second came tinnily from 
the little box on the table, 

“You poor, dried-up old maid. 
That guy who’s been hanging 
around would have been over long 
before this, if you knew the first 
thing about being nice to a man.” 
Bertha gasped. “Really, if that’s 
the way you feel — ” 

“Why, honey, I just asked you 
over for breakfast,” the blonde an- 
swered ; at the same time the voice 
from the machine said, 

“I suppose George and me ain’t 
good enough for you. O.K. by me, 
sister. I didn’t really want you to 
come anyway.” 

Trembling, Miss Kent stood up. 
“I’ve never been so insulted!” 
“What’s eating you. Miss Kent?” 
The blonde seemed genuinely puz- 
zled, but again the voice came 
from the plastic box, 

“The old maid’s off her rocker. 
You’d think she was reading my 
mind.” 

Switching her trim little hips, 
the blonde w'alked back to her own 
camp. Bertha Kent dropped 
numbly on the bench, staring at the 
ugly box. “Reading my mind,” 
the woman had said. Somehow the 



machine had done precisely that, 
translating the blonde’s spoken 
words into the real, emotional 
meaning behind them. It was a ter- 
rifying gadget. Bertha was hypno- 
tized by its potential horror — like 
the brutal, devasting trutli spoken 
by a child. 

A camper walked past on the 
road, waving at Miss Kent and 
calling out a cheerful good morn- 
ing. But again the machine read 
the real meaning behind the pleas- 
ant words. 

“So you’ve finally lost your man. 
Miss Kent. The way you dished 
out the orders, it’s a wonder he 
stayed around as long as he did. 
And a pity: you’re an attractive 
woman. You should jnake some 
man a good wife.” 

They all thought that. The 
whole camp had been watching 
her, laughing at her. Bertha felt 
helpless and alone. She needed — 
wanted — someone else; it surprised 
her when she faced that fact. 

Then it dawned on her: the 
camper was right; the blonde was 
right. She had lost Walt through 
her own ridiculous bull-headed- 
ness. In order to assert herself. To 
be an individualist, she had always 
thought. And what did that matter, 
if it imposed this crushing loneli- 
ness? 

For a moment a kind of mad- 
ness seized her. It was tlie dia- 
bolical machine that was torment- 
ing her, not the truth it told. She 
snatched a piece of her broken 
food box and struck at the plastic 
case blindly. There was a splash of 
fire; the gadget broke. 

She .saw Walt look up from his 
stove. She saw him move toward 
her. But she stood paralyzed by a 

93 



MIRACLE BY PRICE 




shattering trauma of pain. The 
voice still came from the speaker, 
and this time it was her own. Her 
mind was stripped naked; she saw 
herself whole, unsheltered by the 
protective veneer of rationalization. 

And she knew the pattern of the 
dream-man she had loved since 
her childhood; she knew why the 
dream had been self-defeating. 

For the idealization was her own 
father. That impossible paragon 
created by the worship of a child. 

The shock was its own cure. She 
was too well-balanced to accept the 
tempting escape of total disorienta- 
tion. Grimly she fought back the 
tide of madness, and in that mo- 
ment she found maturity. She ran 
toward Walt, tears of gratitude in 
her eyes. She felt his arms around 
her, and she clung to him des- 
perately. 

“I was terrified; I needed you, 
Walt; I never want to be alone 
again.” 

“Needed me?” he repeated 
doubtfully. 

“I love you.” After a split- 
second’s hesitation, she felt his lips 
warm on hers. 

From the corner of her eye she 
saw a chute dart out of nowhere 
and scoop up the broken plastic 
box from the camp table. They 
both vanished again. That was a 
miracle, too, she supposed; but not 
nearly as important as hers. 

Then the reason of a logical 
mind asserted its own form of 
realism: of course, none of it had 
happened. The mind-reading gadg- 
et had been a device created in 
her own subconscious, a psycholog- 
ical trick to by-pass the dream that 



had held her imprisoned. She knew 
enough psychology to understand 
that. 

She ran her fingers through 
Walt’s dark hair and repeated 
softly, 

“I love you, Walt Gordon.” 

W AS IT an illusion? I believe 
that. Bill, because later on, 
when I thought of using the grap- 
ple, I brought the Semantic-Trans- 
lator back from nowhere. Ap- 
parently the smaller gadget had 
been in the console or behind it. I 
hadn’t seen it when I searched, be- 
cause my eyes had been hurt by the 
glare of light. 

In the process the Translator 
somehow got twisted around, for 
the chute dragged it back vertically 
through the coil of wire. It touched 
the wall of the cylinder, and the 
whole machine exploded. 

It was impossible to save any- 
thing from the wreckage. But as 
a physicist I assure you. Bill, the 
transposition of matter into light is, 
in terms of our present science, a 
physical impossibility. It is certainly 
not the sort of invention that could 
have been produced by a senile 
old man, pottering around in a 
home laboratory. The only thing I 
regret is that I had no opportunity 
to examine the Semantic-Trans- 
lator, but I’m sure it would have 
proved just as much nonsense. 

I’m going up to Yosemite to- 
morrow for a couple of weeks. If 
you want any further details on the 
Price inventory, look me up at the 
office when I come home. 

Yours, 

Walt Gordon • • •

SPATIAL DELIVERY 

Women on space station assignments shouldn’t get pregnant. 

But there’s a first time for everything. Here’s 
the story of such a time and an historic situation. 

BY RANDALL GARRETT 
9 



O NE thousand seventy-five miles 
above the wrinkled surface of 
Earth, a woman was in pain. 

There, high in the emptiness of 
space. Space Station One swung 
in its orbit. Once every two hours, 
tlie artificial satellite looped com- 
pletely around the planet, watch- 
ing what went on below. Outside 
its bright steel hull was the silence 
of the interplanetary vacuum; in- 
side, in the hospital ward. Lieuten- 
ant Alice Britton clutched at the 
sheets of her bed in pain, then re- 
laxed as it faded away. 

Major Banes looked at her and 
smiled a little. “How do you feel, 
Lieutenant?’’ 

She smiled back; she knew the 
pain wouldn’t return for a few min- 
utes yet. “Fine, doctor. It’s no 
worse than I was expecting. How 
long will it before we can contact 
White Sands?” 

The major looked nervously at 
his wristwatch. “Nearly an hour. 
You’ll be all right.” 

“Certainly,” she agreed, running 
a hand through her brown hair, 
“I’ll bo okay. Just you be on tap 
when I call.” 

The major’s grin broadened. 
“You don’t think I’d miss a histori- 
cal event like this, do you? You take 
it easy. We’re over Eastern Europe 
now, but as soon as we get within 
radio range of New Mexico, I’ll 
beam a call in.” He paused, then 
repeated, “You just take it easy. 
Call the nurse if anything hap- 
pens.” Then he turned and walked 
out of the room. 

Alice Britton closed her eyes. 
Major Banes was all smiles and 
cheer now, but he hadn’t been 
that way five months ago. She 
chuckled softly to herself as she 



thought of his blistering speech. 

“Lieutenant Britton, you’re ei- 
ther careless or brainless; I don’t 
know which! Your husband may be 
the finest rocket jockey in the Space 
Service, but that doesn’t give him 
the right to come blasting up here 
on a supply rocket just to get you 
pregnant!” 

Alice had said: “I’m sure the 
thought never entered his mind, 
doctor. I know it never entered 
mine.” 

“But that was two and a half 
months ago! Why didn’t you come 
to me before this? Of all the tom- 
fool — ” His voice had died off in 
supressed anger. 

“I didn’t know,” she had said 
stolidly. “You know my medical 
record.” 

“I know. I know.” A puzzled 
frown had come over his face then, 
a frown which almost hid the green 
eyes that contrasted so startlingly 
with the flaming red of his hair. 
“The question is: what do we do 
ne.xt? We’re not equipped for ob- 
stetrics up here.” 

“Send me back down to Earth, 
of course.” 

And he had looked up at her 
scathingly. “Lieutenant Britton, it 
is my personal opinion that you 
need your head examined, and not 
by a general practitioner, either! 
Why, I wouldn’t let you get into an 
airplane, much less land on Earth 
in a rocket! If you think I’d permit 
you to subject yourself to eight 
gravities of acceleration in a rocket 
landing, you’re daffy!” 

She hadn’t thought of it before, 
but the major was right. The ter- 
rible pressure of a rocket landing 
would increase her effective body 
weight to nearly half a ton; an 




adult hiunan being couldn’t take 
that sort of punishment for long, 
much less the tiny life that was 
growing within her. 

So she had stayed on in the Space 
Station, doing her job as always. 
As Chief Radar Technician, she 
was important in the operation of 
the station. Her pregnancy had 
never made her uncomfortable; 
the slow rotation of the wheel- 
shaped station about its axis gave 
an effective gravity at the rim only 
half that of Earth’s surface, and 
the closer to the hub she went, the 
less her weight became. 

According to the major, the 
baby was due sometime around the 
first of September. “Two hundred 
and eighty days,” he had said. 
"Luckily, we can pinpoint it almost 
exactly. And at a maximum of half 
of Earth gravity, you shouldn’t 
weigh more than seventy pounds 
then. You’re to report to me at 
least once a week. Lieutenant.” 

As the words went through her 
mind, another spasm of pain hit 
her, and she clenched her fists 
tightly on the sheets again. It went 
away, and she took a deep breath. 

Everything had been fine until 
today. And then, only half an hour 
ago, a meteor had hit the radar 
room. It had been only a tiny bit 
of rock, no bigger than a twenty- 
two bullet, and it hadn’t been 
traveling more than ten miles per 
second, but it had managed to 
punch its way through the shield- 
ing of the station. 

The self-sealing walls had closed 
the tiny hole quickly, but even in 
that short time, a lot of air had 
gone whistling out into the vacuum 
of space. 

The depressurization hadn’t hurt 

98 



her too much, but the shock had 
been enough to start labor. The 
baby was going to come two months 
early. 

She relaxed a little more, wait- 
ing for the next pain. There was 
nothing to worry about; she had 
absolute faith in the red-haired 
major. 

The major himself was not so 
sure. He sat in his office, massaging 
his fingertips and looking worriedly 
at the clock on the wall. 

The Chief Nurse at a nearby 
desk took off her glasses and looked 
at him speculatively. “Something 
wrong, doctor?” 

“Incubator,” he said, without 
taking his eyes off the clock. 

“I beg your pardon?” 

“Incubator. We can’t deliver a 
seven-month preemie without an 
incubator.” 

The nurse’s eyes widened. “Good 
Lord! I never thought of that! 
What are you going to do?” 

“Right now, I can’t do anything. 
I can’t beam a radio message 
through the Earth. But as soon as 
we get within radio range of White 
Sands, I’ll ask them to send up an 
emergency rocket with an incuba- 
tor. But — ” 

“But what?” 

“Will we have time? The pains 
are coming pretty fast now. It will 
be at least three hours before they 
can get a ship up here. If they miss 
us on the next time around, it’ll be 
five hours. She can’t hold out that 
long.” 

The Chief Nurse turned her eyes 
to the slowly moving second hand 
of the wall clock. She could feel a 
lump in her throat. 

Major Banes was in the Com- 
munications Center a full five min- 



RANDALL GARRETT 




utes before the coastline of Califor- 
nia appeared on the curved horizon 
of the globe beneath them. He had 
spent the hour typing out a com- 
plete report of what had happened 
to Alice Britton and a list of what 
he needed. He handed it to the 
teletype operator and paced the 
floor impatiently as he waited for 
the answer. 

When the receiver teletype began 
clacking softly, he leaned over the 
page, waiting an.\iousIy for every 
word.

Banes nodded and turned to the 
operator. “I want a direct open 
telephone line to my office in case 
I have to get another message to 
the base before we get out of range 
again.” 

He turned and left through the 
heavy door. Each room of the 
space station was protected by air- 
tight doors and individual heating 
units; if some accident, such as a 
really large meteor hit, should re- 
lease the air from one room, nearby 
rooms would be safe. 

Banes’ next stop was the hospi- 
tal ward. 

Alice Britton was resting quietly, 

SPATIAL DELIVERY 



but there were lines of strain around 
her eyes which hadn’t been there 
an hour before. 

“How’s it coming, Lieutenant?” 

She smiled, but another spasm 
hit her before she could answer. 
After a time, she said; “I’m doing 
fine, but you look as if you’d been 
through the mill. What’s eating 
you?” 

He forced a nervous smile. “No- 
thing but the responsibility. You’re 
going to be a very famous woman, 
you know. You’ll be the mother of 
the first child born in space. And 
it’s my job to sec to it that you’re 
both all right.” 

She grinned. “Another Dr. Da- 
foe?” 

“Something on that order, I sup- 
pose. But it won’t be all my glory. 
Colonel Gates, the O.B. man, was 
supposed to come up for the de- 
livery in September, so when White 
Sands contacted us, they said he 
was coming immediately.” He 
pau.sed, and a genuine smile 
crossed his face. “Your husband is 
bringing him up.” 

“Jim! Coming up here? Wonder- 
ful! But I’m afraid the colonel Vv-ill 
be too late. This isn’t going to last 
that long.” 

Banes had to fight hard to keep 
his face smiling when she said that, 
but he managed an easy nod. 
“We’ll see. Don’t hurry it, though. 
Let nature take its course. I’m not 
such a glory hog that I’d not let 
Gates have part of it — or all of it, 
for that matter. Relax and take it 
easy.” 

He went on talking, tr^’ing to 
keep the conversation light, but his 
eyes kept wandering to his wrist- 
watch, timing Alice’s pain intervals. 
They were coming too close to- 

99 




gether to suit him. 

There was a faint rap, and the 
heavy airtight door swung open 
to admit the Chief Nurse. “There’s 
a message for you in your office, 
doctor. I’ll send a nurse in to be 
with her.” 

He nodded, then turned back to 
Alice. “Stiff uppah lip, and all that 
sort of rot,’’ he said in a phony 
British accent. 

“Oh, TZiwtheT, old chap,” she 
grinned. 

Back in his office. Banes picked 
up the teletype flimsy.

B anes sat on the edge of his 
desk, pounding a fist into the 
palm of his left hand. “Two hours. 
It isn’t soon enough. She’ll never 
hold out that long. And we don’t 
have an incubator.” His voice was 
a clipped monotone, timed with 
the rhythmic slamming of his fist. 

The Chief Nurse said: “Can’t 
we build something that will do 
until the rocket gets here?” 

Bancs looked at her, his face 
expressionless. “What would we 
build it out of? There’s not a spare 
piece of equipment in the station. 
It costs money to ship material up 
here, you know. Anything not es- 
sential is left on the ground.” 

100 



The phone rang. Banes picked it 
up and identified himself. 

The voice at the other end said: 
“This is Communications, Major. 
I tape recorded all the monitor 
pickups from the Earth radio sta- 
tions, and it looks as though the 
Space Service has released the in- 
formation to the public. Lieutenant 
Britton’s husband was right when 
he said the whole world’s praying 
for her. Do you want to hear the 
tapes?” 

“Not now, but thanks for the in- 
formation.” He hung up and looked 
into the Chief Nurse’s eyes. 
“They’ve released the news to the 
public.” 

She frowned. “That really puts 
you on the spot. If the baby dies, 
they’ll blame you.” 

Bancs slammed his fist to the 
desk. “Do you think I give a tink- 
er’s dam about that? I’m interested 
in saving a life, not in worrying 
about what people may think!” 
“Yes, sir. I just thought — ” 
“Well, think about something 
useful! Think about how we’re 
going to save that baby!” He 
paused as he saw her eyes. “Fm 
sorry. Lieutenant. My nerves are 
all raw, I guess. But, dammit, my 
field is space medicine. I can han- 
dle depressurization, space sickness, 
and things like that, but I don’t 
know anything about babies! I 
know what I read in medical 
school, and I watched a delivery 
once, but that’s all I know. I don’t 
even have any references up here; 
people aren’t supposed to go around 
having babies on a space station!” 
“It’s all right, doctor. Shall I 
prepare the delivery room?” 

His laugh was hard and short. 
“Delivery room! I wish to Heaven 

RANDALL GARRETT 




we had one! Prepare the ward 
room next to the one she’s in now, 
I guess. It’s the best we have. 

“So help me Hannah, I’m going 
to see some changes made in reg- 
ulations! A situation like this 
won’t happen again!’’ 

The nurse left quietly. She knew 
Banes wasn’t really angry at the 
Brittons; it was simply his way of 
letting off steam to ease the tension 
within him. 

The slow, monotonous rotation 
of the second hand on the wall 
clock seemed to drag time grudg- 
ingly along with it. Banes wished 
he could smoke to calm his raw 
nerves, but it was strictly against 
regulations. Air was too precious 
to be used up by smoking. Every 
bit of air on board had had to be 
carried up in rockets when the 
station was built in space. The air 
purifiers in the hydroponics section 
could keep the air fresh enough for 
breathing, but fire of any kind 
would overtax the system, leaving 
too little oxygen in the atmosphere. 

It was a few minutes of ten when 
he decided he’d better get back 
to Alice Britton. She was trying to 
read a book between spasms, but 
she wasn’t getting much read. She 
dropped it to the floor when he 
came in. 

“Am I glad to see you! It won’t 
be long now.” She looked at him 
analytically. “Say! Just what is 
eating you? You look more hag- 
gard than I do!” 

Again he tried to force a smile, 
but it didn’t come off too well. 
“Nothing serious. I just want to 
make sure everything comes out all 
right.” 

She smiled. “It will. You’re all 
set. You ordered the instruments 

SPATIAL DELIVERY 



months ago. Or did you forget 
something?” 

That hit home, but he just grin- 
ned feebly. “I forgot to get some- 
body to boil water.” 

“Whatever for?” 

“Coffee, of course. Didn’t you 
know that? Papa always heats up 
the water; that keeps him out of 
the way, and the doctor has coffee 
afterwards.” 

Alice’s hands grasped the sheet 
again, and Banes glanced at his 
watch. Ninety seconds! It was long 
and hard. 

When the pain had ebbed away, 
he said; “We’ve got the delivery 
room all ready. It won’t be much 
longer now.” 

“I’ll say it won’t! How about 
the incubator?” 

There was a long pause. Finally, 
he said softly: “There isn’t any 
incubator. I didn’t take the pos- 
sibility of a premature delivery into 
account. It’s my fault. I’ve done 
what I could, though; the ship is 
bringing one up. I — I think we’ll 
be able to keep the child alive 
until — ” 

He stopped. Alice was bubbling 
up with laughter. 

“Lieutenant! Lieutenant Britton! 
Alice! This is no time to get 
hysterical! Stop it!” 

Her laughter slowed to a chuck- 
le. “Me get hysterical! That’s a 
good one! What about you? You’re 
so nervous you couldn’t sip water 
out of a bathtub without spilling 
it!” 

He blinked. “What do you 
mean?” 

Another pain came, and he had 
to wait until it was over before he 
got her answer. “Doctor,” she 
said, “I thought you would have 

101 




figured it out. Ask yourself just one 
question. Ask yourself, ‘Why is a 
space station like an incubator?’ ” 

Space Ship Twelve docked at 
Space Station One at exactly 
eleven thirty-four, and two men 
in spacesuits pushed a large, bulky 
package through the airlock. 

Major Peter Banes, haggard but 
smiling, met Captain Britton in the 
corridor as he and the colonel 
entered the hospital ward. 

Banes nodded to Colonel Gates, 
then turned to Britton. “I don’t 
know whether to congratulate you 
or take a poke at you, Captain, but 
I suppose congratulations come 
first. S’our son, James Edward Brit- 
ton II, is doing fine, thank you.” 

“You mean — alrrady?" 

The colonel said nothing, but he 
raised an eyebrow. 



“Over an hour ago,” said Bancs. 
“But — but — the incubator — ” 
Bancs’ grin widened. “We’ll put 
the baby in it, now that we’ve got 
it, but it really isn’t necessary. 
Your wife figured that one out. 
A space station is a kind of in- 
cubator itself, you sec. It protects 
us p>oor, weak humans from the 
terrible conditions of space. So all 
we had to do was close up one of 
the airtight rooms, sterilize it, warm 
it up, and put in extra oxygen from 
the emergency tanks. Young James 
is perfectly comfortable.” 

“Excellent, Major!” said die 
colonel. 

“Don't thank me. It was Captain 
Britton’s wife who — ” 

But Captain Britton wasn’t lis- 
tening any more. He was headed 
toward his wife’s room at top speed.

A ll the way over, all through 
the loneliness of the long trip, 
he had consoled himself w'i^ the 
thought of the reception he would 
get. How they would crowd around 
him, how they would gape and 
cheer! All the most prominent and 
most important Earthlings would 
rush to see him, to touch their own 
appendages to his tentacles, to re- 
ceive his report of interplanetary 
good will. His arrival would cer- 
tainly be the most celebrated occa- 
sion in all the history of Earth . 

He was coming in for a landing, 
and it was no time for day-dream- 
ing. He brought the ship down 
slowly, in the middle of a large 
square, as carefully as if he were 
settling down among his own 
people. He gave them a chance to 



get out from under him before • 
making contact with the ground. 
When the ship finally rested firmly , 
on the strange planet, he gave a ' 
sigh of relief, and for a few long' 
seconds sat there motionless. And- 
then he began to move toward the 
door. 

The increased gravity did not 
affect him as badly as he had 
thought it would. For the dense 
atmosphere, with its high oxygen 
content, he had of course been pre- 
pared. He injected another dose of 
respiratory enzyme into his blood- 
stream just to make sure, and then 
swung open the door. The inrush 
of air caused only a momentary 
dizziness. 

Then he climbed over the side 
and stared about in surprise. 




No one was paying any attention 
to him. 

Their indifference was so 
enormous that it struck him like a 
blow. Individuals of both sexes — 
he could easily distinguisli them by 
the difference in their clothing — 
were going about their own busi- 
ness as if he simply were not there. 
A small animal running about on 
all fours had its forepart to the 
ground. It trotted from one place 
to another, making a slight noise 
with an organ that he felt sure was 
used for the intake of o.xygen. 
When it came to him, it sniffed 
slightly, without any especial inter- 
est, and then ran off to more im- 
portant business. No other creature 
paid him even that much attention. 

Can it be, he asked himself in- 
credulously, that they don’t see 
me? Perhaps tlieir organs of vision 
make use of different wave lengths. 
Perhaps to them I and the ship are 
not pink and gray respectively, but 
a perfect black which fails to regis- 
ter. I must speak to them, I must 
make m^'self known. They may be 
startled, but I must take the 
chance. 

He rolled over to an individual 
who towered over him a full spard, 
and said gravely, “Greetings! I, 
Xhanph, bring you greetings from 
the inhabitants of the planet, Gfun. 
I come with a message of friend- 
ship — ” 

There could be no doubt that 
the other heard him. And saw him 
too. He looked straight at Xhanph, 
muttered something, probably 
about a pink monster, which 
Xhanph could guess at but not 
really interpret, and moved on im- 
patiently. }^anph stared after him 

.104 



with an incredulity that grew by 
the moment. 

They didn’t understand his lan- 
guage, that he realized. But surely 
they didn’t have to understand in 
order to be interested. The very 
sight of his ship, a mere glimpse of 
him, the first visitor from inter- 
planetary space, should have been 
enough to bring them flocking 
around. How could they possibly 
greet him with such disinterest, 
with such faces which even to a 
stranger seemed cold and chilling? 

When you have traveled as far as 
he had traveled, you don’t give up 
easily. Another, a shorter individ- 
ual, was coming toward him, and 
he began again, “Greetings! I, 
Xhanph—’’ 

This time the individual didn’t 
even stop, but muttered something 
which must surely have been of the 
nature of an oath. And hurried on. 

Xhanph tried five more times 
before he gave up. If there had 
been the slightest indication of in- 
terest, he would have kept on. But 
there wasn’t. The only feeling he 
could detect was one of impatience 
at being annoyed. And he saw that 
there was nothing else to do but go 
back to his ship. 

For a while he sat there, brood- 
ing. One possible solution struck 
him, although it didn’t seem at all 
probable. These people were not 
representative of their kind. Per- 
haps this entire area he had taken 
for a city was nothing more than a 
retreat for tlie mentally disabled, 
for those who had found the strain 
of living too much and had sunk 
back into a kind of stupor. Perhaps 
elsewhere the people were more 
normal. 

At the thought, he brightened 

WILLIAM MORRISON 




for a moment. Yes, that must be it. 
Convincing himself against his own 
better judgment, he lifted the ship 
into the air again and set it down 
a few dozen grolls away. 

But there was no difference. 
Here, too, the faces looked at him 
blankly, and people hurried away 
impatiently when he tried to stop 
them. 

He knew now that it was useless 
to pick up the ship still another 
time and set it down elsewhere. If 
there was some rational explana- 
tion for such irrational behavior, it 
could be found here just as well as 
anywhere else. And explanation 
there must be. But he would have 
to look for it. It would not come to 
him if he simply sat there in the 
ship and waited for it. 

He got out and locked the ship 
so that in case some one finally did 
show curiosity, no harm would 
come to it. Then he began to roll 
around the city. 

E verywhere he met the 

same indifference as at first. 
Even the children stared at him 
without curiosity, and went on 
with their games. He stopped to 
watch — and to listen. 

They bounced balls, and as they 
bounced, they recited words. When 
something interrupted the even 
tenor of the game and they had to 
begin again, they went back to the 
start of the recitation. Surely, they 
were counting. Listening carefully, 
he learned the fundamentals of 
their system of numerals. At the 
same time, for the sake of perma- 
nence, he made pictorial and audi- 
tory records. 

Every now and then the game 

UNWELCOMED VISITOR 



would be interrupted by a quarrel. 
And a childish quarrel, of course, 
was sure to be full of recrimina- 
tions. You did this, I did that. He 
learned the names of the objects 
with which they played, he learned 
the words for first and second per- 
sons in their different forms. He 
learned the word for the maternal 
parent, who seemed to stand in the 
closest relation to the young ones. 

By evening he had acquired a 
fairly good child’s grasp of the lan- 
guage. He rolled back in the direc- 
tion of the ship. When he came to 
the place where it should be, he 
had a sudden feeling of panic. The 
ship was gone. 

They must have dragged it 
away. Their whole pretense of in- 
difference must have been a trick, 
he thought excitedly. They had 
waited until they could tamper 
with it without his Interference, in 
order to learn its secret.s. What had 
they done with it? Perhaps they 
had harmed it, possibly they had 
ruined the drive. How could he 
ever get off this accursed planet, 
how would he ever get back to 
Gfun? 

He rolled hastily over to the 
nearest man and tried to put his 
newfound vocabulary to use. 
“’Where — where — ” He realized 
suddenly that he didn’t know the 
word for ship. “Where galcnfain?” 

The man looked at him as if he 
were crazy, and walked on. 

Xhanph did some swearing on 
his own account. He began to roll 
madly around the square, becom- 
ing more desperate from moment 
to moment. Finally, just when he 
thought he would explode from 
rage and frustration, he found the 
ship again. It had been dragged to 

105 




a neighboring street and left on a 
vacant lot, surrounded by rusty 
cans, broken bottles, and various 
other forms of garbage and rubbish 
indigenous to this section of the 
planet. 

Relief mingled with a feeling of 
outrage. Xhanph swore again. The 
indignity of it was enough to start 
an interplanetary war. If they ever 
heard of it back on Gfun, they 
would want to blast this stupid and 
insulting planet out of existence. 

He hastened into the ship, and 
found to his joy that there had 
been no damage. There was noth- 
ing to prevent him from taking off 
again and getting back to Gfun. 
But the mystery of his reception 
still intrigued him. He could not 
leave without solving it. 

He rolled out of the ship again 
and stood there watching it. Evi- 
dently they had regarded this 
miracle of engineering as nothing 
more than so much rubbish. They 
would probably leave it alone now. 
He could let it remain here, and in 
the meantime carry on his investi- 
gating as before. 

Things would go more rapidly 
now that he understood some of 
the elements of human speech. All 
he had to do was keep his hearing 
appendages open and interpret the 
key words as he heard them. It 
shouldn’t take him long. One of 
the reasons he had been selected to 
make the trip was that he had a 
gift for languages, and a day or two 
more should suffice to establish 
communications. 

He left the ship again, and be- 
gan to roll around the city. He lis- 
tened to traffic policemen directing 
the flow of helicopters, he stood by 
unobtrusively while boy talked with 

106 



girl — these conversations turned 
out to be very limited in scope, as 
well as uninstructive in syntax — 
and he even managed to get into a 
place of amusement where three 
dimensional images created in him 
a sense of nostalgia. From his slight 
knowledge of the language, he 
could perceive that the dialogue 
was so stale that he himself could 
have supplied it from stories writ- 
ten long ago on his native planet. 
After a lapse of many hours, the 
majority of the people disappeared 
from the streets, and he decided it 
was time to return to his ship and 
suspend animation. 

In the morning he set out again. 
By the end of that day he felt he 
could understand the spoken lan- 
guage well enough. What next? 

To learn the language in written 
form might take too long, and be- 
sides, to solve his mystery he would 
have to waste time in digging up 
the recorded forms that contained 
the necessary information. No, he 
would have to find some one to 
talk to, some one who would have 
the necessary information at his 
tentacle-tips, or as they called the 
appendages here, finger-tips. 

He began to approach various 
people again, undi.scouraged by 
their cold and impolite replies. 
Finally he found the informant he 
had been seeking, an old, white- 
haired individual who was walking 
slowly, with the aid of a cane, along 
one of the wider and quieter 
streets. 

The man looked at him with 
calm lack of interest as he ap- 
proached. Xhanph came to a stop, 
and said, “Greetings! I, Xhanph, 
bring you greetings from the in- 
habitants of the planet, Gfun. I 

WILLIAM MORRISON 




come with a message of friend- 
ship.” 

“Very glad to make your ac- 
quaintance, sir,” said the old man 
F>oliteIy, but still without genuine 
interest. 

At last some one who had an- 
swered! Xhanph started his port- 
able recording machine going. 

“I wish for infonnation. Perhaps 
you can give it to me.” 

“Ah, iny young fellow, I liave 
seen a great deal and know a great 
deal. But it isn’t very often that vou 
young ones want to find out what 
we old folks know.” 

“Perhaps I have not made my- 
self clear. I am an inhabitant of the 
planet. Gfun.” 

“Yes, indeed. Do you intend to 
stay here long?” 

“I have come with a message of 
friendship. But I have found no 
one to receive it.” 

“Mnini. That’s unfortunate,” 
the old man said. “People are very 
impatient nowadays. Time is 
money, they say. t!an't spare the 
money to stop and talk. Couldn’t 
spare it myself, not so long ago. I’m 
retired now, though. U.sed to run a 
stereo store, up around Mudlark 
Street. Biggest store in the city. 
Everybody used to buy from me. 
Jefferson J. Gardner’s my name. 
You may have heard of me on — 
where did you .say you come 
from?” 

“Gfun. However, 1 wish to make 
clear — ” 

“Never sold any stereos to any 
one on Gfun. Probably don’t get 
good reception up there. Sold ’em 
to everybody else, though. I’m well 
known here, Mr. — ” 

“Xhanph. But before you go fur- 
ther—” 

UNWELCOMED VISITOR 



“Got into the stereo game when 
they first came out. Went like hot- 
cakes in tho.se days. Although I 
don’t suppose you know what a 
hotcake is. Quality didn’t count. 
Only thing that counted was size 
of screen and strength of the three- 
dimensional effect. Mr. Gloopher 
— he was M.iyor then — Robert F. 
Gloopher — had a daughter who 
went in for acting . .” 

Not for the first time, Xhanph 
cursed this damnable planet. The 
only man he had found willing to 
talk was senile and his conversa- 
tion rambled wildly like a feather 
in a strong and particularly erratic 
whirlwind. Still, he told himself 
with a touch of philosophy, I have 
wasted so much time, I can afford 
to waste a little more. Sooner or 
later this individual will tell me 
what I want to know. 

Half an hour later, however, 
when Jefferson J. Gardner began 
to repeat himself, Xpanph realized 
that he couldn't just wait for the 
old man to talk himself out. Differ- 
ent tactics were needed. 

He interrupted rudely. “Why 
don’t people pay any attention to 
me?” 

“Eh? What’s that you .say?” 

“I come from the planet, Gfun. 
I thought that as an interplanetary 
visitor I would be received with 
tremendous enthusiasm. Instead I 
fiml myself disregarded.” 

“I recollect that back in the old 
days — ” 

“Never mind that. Why don’t 
people pay any attention to me?” 
“Why shoulcl they?” 

“That is no answer!” 

“But it is, sir,” said the old gen- 
tleman with dignity. “They don’t 
find you out of the ordinary. Why 

107 




pay attention to you?” 

“You mean that you are accus- 
tomed to visitors from space?” 

“No, sir, I mean nothing of the 
kind. What I do mean is that we 
are by now thoroughly accustomed 
to the idea of you. I remember — ” 

“Never mind what you remem- 
ber!” 

“When I was a child, stories 
about visitors from Mars or Venus 
were already trite and stereotyped. 
What could a visitor do? What 
might a visitor look like? All the 
fKJssible answers had already been 
given, and we were familiar with 
every one of them. We imagined 
visitors with tentacles and without, 
with a thousand legs and no legs, 
with five heads and seven feet, and 
eighteen stomachs. We imagined 
visitors who were plants, or elec- 
trical impulses, or viruses, or 
energy-creatures. They had the 
power to read minds, to move ob- 
jects telekinetically and to travel 
through impossible dimensions. 
Their space ships were of all kinds, 
and they could race along with 
many times the speed of light or 
crawl with the speed of molasses. I 
do not know, sir, in which category 
you fall — whether you are animal, 
vegetable, mineral, or electrical — 
but I know that there is nothing 
new about you.” 

“But you are familiar merely 
with the ideas. I am a real visitor!” 

“Young man, I am a hundred 
and ten years old, and the idea of 
you was already ancient when I 
was eight. I remember reading 
about you in a comic book. You 
are not the first visitor who has pre- 
tended to be real. There were hun- 
dreds before you. I have seen press 
agent stunts by the dozen, and ad- 

108 



vertising pictures by the hundreds 
about Mars, about Venus, about 
the Moon, about visitors from in- 
terstellar space. Your pretended 
colleagues have walked the streets 
of innumerable cities, until now we 
are weary of the entire tribe of you. 
And you yourself, sir, if you will 
pardon the expression, you are an 
anticlimax.” 

“Your race must be insane,” pro- 
tested Xhanph. “For all you know 
I may come with great gifts which 
I wish to confer upon you.” 

“We have been fooled before. 
And in view of the fact, as I have 
reminded you, that time is money, 
we do not wish to bankrupt our- 
selves by investigating.” 

“But suppose I’m here to harm 
you!” 

“If your race is capable of it, we 
can hardly stop you, so it is no use 
trying. If incapable, you are wast- 
ing your efforts.” 

“This is insanity, genuine racial 
insanity!” 

“You repeat yourself. The fact 
is, we have become blas6,” said the 
old man. “Thanks to the efforts of 
our science fiction writers, we have 
experienced in imagination all 
there is to experience in interplane- 
tary contact, and the genuine ar- 
ticle can be only a disappointment. 
I am reminded of an incident that 
occurred when Gerald Crombie, 
who was City Councilman at the 
time, ordered a twenty-five inch 
stereo set . .” 



X HANPH rolled away. He had 
his answer now, and he 
couldn’t stand listening any longer 
to the old man’s babbling. He 
rolled aimlessly, up one street and 

WILLIAM MORRISON 




down another. And he thought of 
how they would receive his answer 
when he went back to Gfun. 

Was it him or the planet that 
they would consider mad? Almost 
certainly, they wouldn’t believe 
him. He could imagine the ex- 
change of wondering glances, the 
first delicate hints that the long trip 
had deranged him, the not so deli- 
cate hints later on when he per- 
sisted in sticking to his story. He re- 
membered the high hopes with 
which he had departed, the mes- 
sages with which he had been en- 
trusted by the Chief of Planetary 
Affairs, the Head of the Scientific 
Bureau, the Director of Economic 
Affairs, and countless others. And 
he could imagine the reception he 
would find when he reported that 
he had been unable to deliver a 
single message. 

How long he rolled in this aim- 
less fashion he did not know. After 
a time he seemed to come to his 
senses. It was no use trying to run 
away from reality, as he was doing. 
He had to go back to the ship and 



return to Gfun. Let them believe 
him or not, his report would tell 
the truth. And the pictorial and 
auditory records would confirm his 
story. 

What a planet, he thought again. 
Of all its hundreds of millions, its 
billions of inhabitants, not one had 
the curiosity, the ordinary intellec- 
tual decency, to be interested in 
him. Not one had the imagination, 
the awareness — 

“Pardon me,” said a shrill voice, 
“E.\cuse me for reading thoughts, 
but 1 could not help overhearing — 
I am a visitor here myself.” 

He swung around. The figure 
before him was strange, but an 
aura of friendliness came from it 
and he knew there was nothing to 
fear. Nothing to fear — and much 
to be thankful for. 

With a heartfelt double sigh, 
while disinterested passersby spared 
them not even a glance, pink ten- 
tacles and green streamers clasped 
in a gesture of friendship that 
spanned the millions of miles of in- 
terplanetary space. • • .

REPORT TO 
THE PEOPLE OF RIOS 

On March 29. 2049 (Rios 
Time), the Rios-Nwadian war 
ended. 

This report on the recent con- 
flict has been prepared by the 
Bureau of Public Information and 
Education. Rios Branch, for the 
purixise of enlightening the inhabi- 
tants of Rios about the War, its 
causes, and the proposed policy of 
the Nwndian government concern- 
ing the administration of your 
planet. 

In order to provide for full un- 
derst.inding by the people of Rios. 
Riosic terminology shall be used 
wherever possible in this rep>ort. 
Thus. Rios shall be called ‘Earth’, 
Nwad shall be designated ‘Venus’, 
and all dates, measurements and 
other data which arc difTerent on 
the two planets shall be indicated 
according to the Riosic calculation. 

The War ended on March 29, 
2049 when the last Earthian troops 
surrendered to the Venusian peace 
forces. 

When did the War begin? The 
first battle was fought on December 
18. 2048. but the first ‘incident’ 
that led directly to the conflict oc- 
curred in November, 20-12. And 
es'en before that date, many years 
before, officials on Venus knew 
that war between the two worlds 
was inevitable. 

Space scientists of Venus have 
bf^en observing Earth for hundreds 
of years. The first spare ship to 
reach )*our planet and return to 

10 




Venus made its voyage in the 
Earth year, 1891. From that time 
on, explorations were made spo- 
radically until the 1950’s, when 
revolutionary improvements in the 
design of our ships made possible 
more economical and faster trips. 

It is an interesting coincidence, 
incidentally, that atomic power was 
discovered on Earth just as we on 
Venus had made atomic driven 
spacecraft obsolete by the introduc- 
tion of the magnetico-gravitational 
drive. This fact is mentioned be- 
cause it was the evidence of atomic 
explosions on Earth that increased 
our interest in your planet a cen- 
tury ago. 

In all our ob.servations of Earth, 
the most obvious fact we learned 
was that its dominant race was 
aggressive and war-like in nature. 
Having no desire to introduce this 
war-inindedness to our peaceful 
world, we avoided all contact with 
Earth. 

We realized, however, that in 
time the Earth race would accom- 
plish space travel and thus force 
a contact with us. Therefore, we 
devised highly potent weapons for 
our defense in the event that the 
people of Earth ever stopped quar- 
reling among themselves and at- 
tempted an attack on our world. 

High officials in our government 
were appalled at the thought of 
war' with its chaotic and indis- 
criminate killing. There were those 
who deemed it an actual act of 
aggression on our part to arm our- 
selves in preparation for a war. 
The opposition to our defense pro- 
gram was strong. Yet, it was our 
preparedness which saved our 
civilization from destruction when 
your forces launched their invasion 



of our planet last year. 

To understand the events which 
led to The War, it is best that we 
briefly review the history of space 
travel by Earthians. In the year 
2002, the six remaining nations of 
the Earth formed the Federation 
to abolish war and to enable the 
people of your planet to put forth 
a united effort to discover the 
secret of interplanetary travel. 
This endeavour, in itself, was con- 
sidered by our leaders to be most 
creditable. But the entire pattern 
of your development, observed for 
many centuries, instilled seeds of 
doubt in our minds. You were con- 
ditioned to war and the mere 
establishment of a Federation to 
monitor the future was not ade- 
quate insurance, we felt, against 
further conflict. In your concentra- 
tion on conquering space, however, 
you did stop warring among your- 
selves. 

Space travel from Earth began 
thirty-eight years ago. The first 
successful trip to Luna and back 
was made in 2011, and by 2020 
the Lunar space port was opened. 
It was in 2020, also, that the space 
ship. Pioneer, left for Mars. It was 
never heard from again. 

Unsuccessful attempts to travel 
to the other planets were made 
during the years 2021-2027. The 
Pioneer II, bound for Mars, the 
Adventurer, bound for Mars, and 
the Enterprise, bound for Venus, 
all disappeared without a trace. 

In September, 2028, the Space 
King returned to Earth after com- 
pleting a voyage to Mars. The ship 
landed safely, but the excited cele- 
bration that greeted it was short- 
lived when it was discovered that 



111 




the entire crew was afflicted with a 
neurological disease that your 
Earth scientists labeled ‘space sick- 
ness’. This disease posed a new 
obstacle to interplanetary travel. It 
attacked indiscriminately and it 
proved fatal in almost every case. 

Research and experimentation on 
the cause and cure of ‘space sick- 
ness’ was carried on continuously 
from the time the Space King re- 
turned with its dying crew until 
the disease was conquered in 2041. 
During these years, the experi- 
mental ships Enterprise II, Razor- 
back, and Space King II were 
utilized as laboratories in orbital 
flights. 

In April, 2041, the space liner 
Morning Star was completed, in- 
corporating technological improve- 
ments designed to prevent the oc- 
currence of ‘space sickness’. The 
Morning Star left the Lunar sta- 
tion on July 17, 2042. Its destina- 
tion was Venus. 

In government circles on Venus, 
it was felt that no further delay 
could be permitted in establishing 
contact with the people of Earth. 
They were already too close to 
space flight maturity to forego any 
opportunity for formulating an un- 
derstanding. Therefore, The Morn- 
ing Star, whose flight had been ob- 
served contsantly, was allowed to 
pass through our ionic barrier and 
land unharmed on our planet. 
Emissaries of our Lora Dannun 
( nearest translation : Supreme 

Council) were on hand to greet 
the Earthmen when they left their 
ship. 

As a precautionary measure, two 
atomic scorchers were trained on 
the ship, but our officials ap- 
proached the debarking Earthmen

ly manner. The Earthmen, under- 
standably apprehensive, came for- 
ward with their hand weapons 
drawn. 

Although we on Venus were al- 
ready familiar with your Interna- 
tional English language, our wel- 
coming committee did not think 
it wise to further startle the men 
from Earth by greeting them in 
their own tongue. Therefore, our 
friendly intentions were made 
known by elaborate and unmis- 
takable gestures. 

The aliens from Earth, neverthe- 
less, were startled enough by our 
appearance. They stared wide-eyed 
at what appeared to be four child- 
like specimens of human beings. 
This resemblance which Venusians 
bear to humans, and which should 
have impressed the crew of the 
Morning Star with the possibili- 
ties of intelligent negotiations, did 
not deter them from jumping to ir- 
rational conclusions. 

Our chief emissary, Ser Madi, 
heard their leader and his lieu- 
tenant in the following conversa- 
tion (which is reproduced from the 
auto-tape recording made on the 
spot) : 

Leader: What do you make of 
them, Jensen? They look almost 
like human children, don’t they? 
Lieutenant: There doesn’t seem 
to be anything to worry about 
here, sir. They seem friendly 
enough. But why children? You’d 
think they’d send some bigwigs 
out to welcome us. Why did 
they send children? 

Leader: I don’t know . May- 
be it’s a trap! 

Lieutenant: You’re right, sir. We 



NORAMN ARKAWY and STANLEY HENIG 




can’t afford to take any chances. 
Leader; Take them back to the 
ship for the psych boys to work 
on. I don’t like the looks of this. 

At this point Ser Madi revealed 
his knowledge of the Earth lan- 
guage. “I assure you, gentlemen,” 
he said to the strangers, “that this 
is not a trap. Please follow us peace- 
fully.” 

The invaders were stunned into 
silence, but it took the leader only 
a moment to recover. “I’ll be 
damned!” he exclaimed. “The sly 
little devils understand English! 
Jensen! Have these creatures es- 
corted onto the Star. This is some- 
thing we’ll have to talk over on the 
ship.” 

At a signal from the man called 
Jensen, eight of your people ad- 
vanced toward the four members of 
our welcoming committee. Ser 
Madi spoke again; “I warn you, 
sir, not to try to abduct us. Order 
your men back.” 

The leader of the Earthmen 
laughed. “Look at them!” he said 
to his lieutenant. “These things are 
threatening us!” The soldiers had 
paused at Ser Madi’s words. “Go 
on,” the leader ordered them. 
“Take them aboard the ship!” 
“You were warned,” Ser Madi 
said sadly. He motioned to his 
companions and, in an instant of 
brilliant light, the space ship was 
reduced to smoldering ashes. 

The stunned Earthians were eas- 
ily taken into custody. They were 
completely awed by the destruction 
of their ship, which had been ac- 
complished with “invisible” weap- 
ons. Ser Madi did not think it 
necessary to explain the compact- 
ness and efficiency of the atomic 

PEACE 



scorchers to them. They would not 
have been able to comprehend the 
principles behind the finger ring 
weapons. 

Captain Daniels, the leader of 
the Earth expedition, was interro- 
gated at great length, but he re- 
mined hostile and uncooperative. 
The only information that he of- 
fered was his name, rank and serial 
number, which he repeated over 
and over again. Jensen and the re- 
maining crew members refused to 
answer our questions also, insist- 
ing that their captain was the 
spokesman for all of them. This 
action increased our fears that the 
intellectual and emotional make-up 
of Earth was incompatible with 
that of Venus. 

We accomplished nothing in 
four days of questioning. It seemed 
impossible to determine the means 
whereby we could arrive at some 
workable line of reasoning. It was 
equally impossible for us to ascer- 
tain whether the hostile actions of 
the Morning Star represented the 
attitude of the Earth government 
or if they were merely the im- 
pulsive results of the emotional 
strain endured by Captain Daniels 
and his crew on their voyage. 

The Supreme Council decided it 
was necessary to visit Earth now, 
make our presence known, and see 
if friendly relations could be es- 
tablished with that planet. We had 
hopes that this might be done, for 
there had been no war on Earth 
for almost fifty years. It was hoped 
that the people had finally achieved 
a civilization capable of friendly in- 
terplanetary exchange. 

The Council ordered a delega- 
tion to leave immediately on the 

113 




first diplomatic mission from Venus 
to Eai^. Ser Madi had justifiable 
doubts about the possibility of suc- 
cess, but the Council overruled his 
objections. 

The delegation, led by the elder 
statesman, ^r Alaga, left for Earth 
aboard the light cruiser, Tunn. The 
date was December 9, 2042. Re- 
turning to Earth aboard the Tunn, 
were the eleven survivors of the 
Morning Star, treated not as pris- 
oners, but as survivors of a space 
wreck. 

The Tunn landed on Earth two 
miles out of Abilene, on Decem- 
ber 15, 2042. A few hours after 
touching down, the Venusian dele- 
gation arrived in the Earth capi- 
tal and presented themselves at the 
Ministry of State. 

The office worker who stood be- 
tween them and the Secretary of 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs was 
amused by the delegates’ story. 
“Why don’t you kids go home and 
stop annoying us?” he said. “And 
stop watching those TD shows!” 

Ser Buldi indignantly repeated 
his request to see the Foreign Min- 
ister. 

“Get out of here!” the office 
worker said in a tone that indicated 
he was through talking to us. 

Ser Buldi began to reply but he 
was silenced by Ser Alaga, who 
wished to avoid any unnecessary in- 
cidents which could have proved 
embarrassing to the Earthmen. In- 
stead, the elder statesman ap- 
proached a young lady seated be- 
hind a desk. 

“What can I do for you, little 
boy?” the girl asked with a smile. 

Ser Alaga, with the aid of his 
hypno-tube, quickly convinced her 

114 



to admit the delegates to the office 
of the Sub-Secretary for Foreign 
Affairs. 

Then began a three day proces- 
sion through the offices of many 
sub-secretaries, four under-secre- 
taries and two deputy ministers. In 
each office our diplomats were re- 
ceived skeptically and passed on to 
the next. 

Finally, in desperation, the dele- 
gation released the survivors of the 
Morning Star. Although Ser Alaga 
realized that their account of the 
incident probably would be dis- 
torted, he knew that it would serve 
to verify the delegation’s identity. 

The Abilene News of December 
19, 2042, shouted at the top of its 
headline voice; 

SPACE INVADERS HERE 

The Bugle: 

EARTH ATTACKED 

The Times: 

"MORNING STAR" DESTROYED 

11 Survivors Of Space Liner 
Tell Story Of Attack 

An immediate meeting was held 
between our delegation and the 
leaders of your government. After 
the formalities of greeting were 
over, the spokesman for the Earth 
government reviewed the facts of 
the Morning Star incident as they 
had been related by Captain Dan- 
iels and his crew. Venusian forces, 
they claimed, had been guilty of 
an unprovoked attack against the 
ship. We had barbarously mur- 
dered all of the ship’s complement, 
save for the eleven “hostages” 
whom we had brought to Earth 
aboard the Tunn.

The government of Earth de- 
manded an explanation. Ser Alaga 
spoke the truth. The Earthians 
were not satisfied. 

(the followino conversation is 

REPRODUCED FROM THE AUTO-TAPE 
RECORDING OF THE. MEETING) 

Earth Spokesman: We will grant 
that your act of aggression was 
not premeditated, but resulted 
from a misinterpretation, on your 
part, of the friendly intentions 
of our forces. Nevertheless, our 
vessel was destroyed. Twenty- 
three of our men were killed. The 
government of the World Fed- 
eration demands that your gov- 
ernment make suitable repara- 
tions. 

Ser Alaga: Mr. Cartwright, we 
respectfully deny the allegation 
that our forces were guilty of any 
act of aggression. 

Cartwright: The Morning Star was 
destroyed by your men, was it 
not? 

Ser Alaga: In self-defense, yes. As 
we have explained, the captain 
of your ship threatened our wel- 
coming committee with . 
Cartwright: None of your men 
were harmed! 

Ser Alaga: They prevented their 
own imminent destruction by 
their action in self-defense. It 
was this action which resulted in 
the unfortunate . 

Cartwright; Our ship and our men 
were attacked before they had 
fired a shot. Therefore, your ac- 
tion cannot be deemed to have 
taken place in self-defense. 

Ser Alaga: Your reasoning con- 
founds me, sir. If the prevention 
of aggressive action is termed 
aggression, then we are guilty of 

116 



it. I bow to your logic. 

Naturally our government 
wishes to express its regrets over 
the impulsive act of its repre- 
sentatives. We want to meet with 
you in peace and friendship. We 
want to prevent any future in- 
cidents such as the one which 
has brought us here today. 
Cartwright; On behalf of the 
World Federation, I accept your 
apology. We, too, would like to 
prevent further strife between 
our worlds. There is much to be 
gained by a useful and coopera- 
tive alliance between Earth and 
Venus. But, to insure this, we 
feel that your government should 
make certain . payments in 
reparation for our losses. 

Ser Alaga: Although I am in sym- 
pathy with your views, our dele- 
gation has not been empowered 
to o^er any reparations. How- 
ever, if you will indicate what 
your government would consider 
a suitable payment for your 
losses, we shall convey your re- 
quest to our Council. 

(end of auto-tape recording) 

Yttrium was the reparation asked 
by Earth — five thousand pounds of 
isolated and purified Yttrium. This 
metal was essential for the con- 
struction of Earth’s space ships, the 
“alumiryten” alloy being used in 
the manufacture of the tough Outer 
shell of tliese ships. 

The supply of Yttrium ores on 
Venus is almost unlimited, and the 
Council had no trouble delivering 
the requested amount of the re- 
fined metal. The last shipment of 
ingots reached Earth within three 
months. 



NORMAN ARKAWY and STANLEY HENIG 




This conciliatory payment was 
intended to preserve the peace and 
build good will within the system. 
It was our intention that, if possi- 
ble, the Earth would assume a more 
respKjnsible attitude toward the 
greater scope of friendly interplan- 
etary relations. It was our hope that 
harmony would form a permanent 
bond between our two worlds. 

Our efforts were wasted. 

YTTRIUM SHIPMENTS 
IMPURE 

screamed the tabloid headlines. 
President Iverson of the World 
Federation sent a stiff note to the 
Council on Venus. He demanded 
apologies and immediate restitu- 
tions, claiming that sixty percent 
of the metal delivered was actually 
zirconium. We had cheated them, 
said Iverson. 

In a terse reply to his note, our 
government branded the Iverson 
accusation a lie. It was all too ap>- 
parent what was intended. We re- 
fused to discuss the matter. We 
broke off all diplomatic relations 
with Earth and simply ignored the 
numerous threats and accusations 
that were continuously being made. 

Our vigilance increased, how- 
ever, and we prepared for the at- 
tack that Iverson promised when 
he said: “Venus has not yet felt 
the force of Earth . They will!” 

Several years pas.sed, during 
which time the Federation built a 
huge space armada, using to good 
advantage the five thousand pounds 
of pure yttrium they had received 
from Venus. It was also during 
these years of preparation that 
Venus and its people were forced 
to accept the hardships of a regi- 
mented economy. Our citizens, 

PEACE 



however, long accustomed to per- 
sorial sacrifice for the welfare of 
Society, did not complain. 

On September 14, 2048, a fleet 
of four hundred Federation war- 
ships took off for Venus. 

The battle in defense of our plan- 
et was carried out exactly accord- 
ing to the strategy of the Supreme 
Council. The first wave of one hun- 
dred attacking ships was complete- 
ly demolished in our ionic barrier. 
Fifty percent of the second wave 
was accounted for in the same man- 
ner. Those ships which did manage 
to pierce the discharging barrier 
were badly damaged and were 
easily destroyed by our cruising dis- 
integrator teams. The third wave 
of invaders was met by our ascend- 
ing task force of sixty scout ships, 
each equipped with twin cosmic 
blasters. In this engagement, three 
of our ships were lost ... all the 
invaders were destroyed. While 
this battle was being fought, our 
space patrol descended upon the 
fourth wave from outer space. 

The Earth fleet was completely 
obliterated. 

On March 14, 2049, our invasion 
fleet attacked the Earth. After two 
weeks of sporadic fighting, the oc- 
cupation was completed. 

Iverson, Cartwright, Briande, 
and the rest of the leaders of 
Earth’s war-like government are in 
exile on their various asteroids. We 
shall not kill them, nor shall we 
allow them to die. They are sup- 
plied with their needs by a ^p 
that calls once a month. Otherwise, 
they are left completely alone on 
their space islands, each a master 
of his own little world. We believe 
this to be a fitting punishment for 
men who try to conquer a world. 

117 




Peace has been restored to the 
system: on Venus, and on Earth. 

Peace Communique No. 2 — Abi- 
lene — May 1, 2049 
One month ago, the provisional 
Venusian government on Earth was 
established to administer the mili- 
tary occupation of your planet. 
During the past month, that gov- 
ernment, assisted by the Venusian 
Administration Corps, has insti- 
tuted reforms whereby peace and 
security have been attained for all 
the Earth. 

What of the future? 

Citizens of Earth, here is your 
future: You are welcomed as 

equals in a union with Venus. For 
a time, until you have learned how 
to govern yourselves peacefully, 
your planet will be directed by 
Venusian administrators. But even 
now — immediately — you shall be 
accorded the same rights and privi- 
leges that the citizens of Venus en- 
joy. 

And you shall have peace! Per- 
haps you should be thankful for 
the last terrible war which your 
leaders brought upon you, for as a 
result of it, you shall no longer 
know the meaning of war. 

Of course, citizens have duties 
as well as rights. Failure to comply 
with regulations is severely pun- 
ished. Therefore, it is adsisable that 
you acquaint yourselves with the 
obligations of a peaceful citizen. 

Tlie duties of a citizen vary, de- 
pending upon the individual’s clas- 
sification and the location in which 
he lives. In addition to his special 
duties, however, every citizen is 
required to know and observe the 
five GENERAL DUTIES of a 
citizen, listed below. 

118 



GENERAL DUTIES OF A CITIZEN 

1. Every citizen will work at his 
appointed task one-third of each 
day. 

2. Every citizen will perform those 
duties necessary to maintain his 
sleeping area in such a manner as 
to comply with the directives posted 
in his barracks. 

3. Every citizen (male) will fa- 
ther/ (female) will bear a child 
once every alternate cycle. 

4. Every citizen will report prompt- 
ly when notified of special duty 
(e.g. waste disposal detail, sewer 
maintenance crew, restorative 
squad). 

5. Every citizen will report to his 
e.xtermination center immediately 
up>on notification. (See Note) 

(Note: Certain measures are neces- 
sary to prevent the over-population 
of a peaceful world. In addition to 
the obvious elimination of the in- 
curably sick, the insane, the feeble- 
minded, the disabled, the dishonest, 
and the aged, periodic extermina- 
tions must be held among the gen- 
eral citizenry. 

Citizens who have been selected 
will report promptly to the ap- 
pointed center for speedy, painless 
extermination. Failure to do so 
will result in a delayed and painful 
process.) 

Now we bid you welcome. Earth- 
men. Take your rightful place be- 
side us and share our peaceful ex- 
istence. By your endless struggles 
through a long heritage of war, you 
have earned it.

MONEY'S THE ROOT OF ALL GOOD fCo^linu.d from page 53) 



“Friend against friend, and the 
old hunting guns polished up for 
more deadly and constant shooting 
— is that a story that belongs in 
galactic history? Is it for this that 
great galactic corporations work — 
to turn peaceable planets into char- 
nel houses for a stinking profit? 

“That’s the charge that you, and 
the rest of your workers, will have 
to answer to — not in courts, but to 
the people of the Galaxy. 

“And, most important — to your- 
selves!” 

“With that, he strode out. 

K im ROGERS was again in the 
presence of Roald Gibbons, 
and he was angry again. 

“And don’t look so smug. I know 
what you did. I worked with your 
father long enough to know about 
his special agents — but don’t think 
the ofieration was all your doing. 

“What do you think happened 
here when you sent that spacegram 
tipping us off that it was Galactic 
Aid behind the mess, and that we 
were to declare it a Class AA. It 
was a madhouse! 

“It accomplished the desired re- 
sult,” Roald said. “When the Gov- 
ernor and the Secretary read that 
Class AA bulletin — and it took 
careful planning and timing to get 
into their ofliice just when it was 
delivered — with me there to pound 
it home, they sort of faded about 
the gills. 

“They came running to me in a 
few minutes. Now they are Honor 
Witnesses at Galactic Court, with 
more than enough testimony to sew 
up Galactic Aid.” 



Roald had a hard time keeping 
his mind on the present conversa- 
tion. He was due to blast to Lyrane 
in a few hours. Hh company was 
proceeding with rehabilitation 
ahead of schedule, with the natural 
zealousness of the Lyranians for 
their old system helping them 
along. 

Roald had not forgotten the 
piquant beauty of Erol Garbin’s 
daughter. He had a hard time keep- 
ing his mind on the conversation. 

“If anyone else had read that 
Class AA bulletin,” Kim said, “we 
would have been sewed up. You 
know perfectly well we don’t have 
the powers you had us state in that 
bulletin. It was a galactic offense to 
even print such a thing. What if the 
Governor had known that?” 

“I counted on him not knowing 
it. Even though he was an execu- 
tive of Galactic Aid, Class AA 
emergencies are so rare that very 
few people are familiar with their 
actual provisions. 

“Certainly, it was a risky bluff. 
But when you’re dealing with that 
sort of power, you have to bluff 
fast and hard. We didn’t have 
enough evidence to actually stop 
Galactic. We needed inside testi- 
mony. When you rescinded the 
Class AA order, two hours later, 
the confession was already signed.” 

Exasperation was now Kini’s 
mood. “One of these times your 
bluff won’t work, and all your se- 
cret agents won’t do you a bit of 
good. Empire law is nothing to 
tamper with.” 

Roald smiled. “I think that Ga- 
lactic Aid found that out.” • • •
