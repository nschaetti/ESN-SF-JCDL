LETTERS 2 



This is the second six-month re- 
port to the consumers — you — cov- 
ering your reactions to matters 
bigger than both of us; what Gal- 
axy prints, should print and should 
not. The action has been honest, 
hectic and highlighted, of course, 
by the serialization of Robert A. 
Heinlein's / Will Fear No Evil. 

Some thoughtful reader evalua- 
tions have come in. 

Dear J akobsson: 

As all dangerous visions must, 1 
Will Fear No Evil is bound to 
touch off an endless controversy. 
Although I do not believe the liter- 
ary quality of the new novel equal 
to that of Stranger in a Strange 
Land, / realize that it does carry 
Heinlein farther into his explora- 
tion of the only human dream 
worth pursuing: the realization of 
new life styles in which one may 
relate to other human beings free- 
ly, openly, and in a manner which 
totally integrates both sensuality 
and spirituality. 

Heinlein is not a young man. 
Old Johann Sebastian Bach Smith 
is, in a sense, Heinlein himself, 
while Eunice is the hope of a glo- 
rious, liberated future which Hein- 
lein is struggling to grasp. The 
struggle is not an easy one; never 
before has the New deviated so 
radically from the Old. Yet Joan 
Eunice is a unique fusion of these 
two quite opposite forces. As liter- 
ature, the novel is flawed (more on 



this in a moment), but as autobi- 
ography it is moving. 

Elaws. Most obviously, a com- 
mon Heinlein tendency carried to 
the extreme: too much talk and 
not enough action. A novel like 
this needs many tasteful yet expli- 
cit sex scenes ( D. H. Lawrence did 
it in Lady Chatterly's Lover few 
achieve it, but it is not impossi- 
ble). Heinlein is on the verge of 
great things, but he's going to have 
to set aside a little more of his 
self-consciousness in order to 
break on through. Eor instance, 
Joan Eunice's last words were tru- 
ly heartbreaking — but who's re- 
sponsible for those damned dashes 
after the f's? [Mr. Heinlein is not 
— nor am I. The real story may 
never be told; but remember, there 
are distributors, retailers and local 
ordinances to deal with. Ed.] 
That's only going halfway and half- 
way measures do not constitute a 
breakthrough. 

But let's give Heinlein credit for 
tackling what is undoubtedly the 
most difficult job of characteriza- 
tion in modern fiction. I hope we 
can look forward to more serious 
and honest attempts to realize this 
vision of a Joyous human frontier. 
A long and happy life to Robert 
Heinlein! May he grow in wisdom 
and courage. 

Thomas R. Smith 
River Falls, Wisconsin 

Dear Sir: 

Have you noticed levels in Hein- 
lein's new book? One: Old man 
dreams it all on his deathbed. Two: 
Imagines Eunice to give alien body 
identity. Three: Eunice survives 
biologically in body (unlikely!). 



2 




Four: Eunice arrives as spirit as- 
sociated yet with her body { the lit- 
eral interpretation). 

Roger C. Lewis 
Owatonna, Minnesota 

Dear Sir: 

As for the final installment of 
Mr. Heinlein's novel, 1 Will Fear 
No Evil, one can only say, pity 
poor Long Beach. I cannot deny 
that the likes of the Reverend 
Thomas Barker do and probably 
will exist. But to suggest that the 
once famed Iowa State Picnic 
(even now fading into obscurity) 
will, by the time of the story, be 
able to mount even one rape is 
taking science fiction and specula- 
tive gerontology too far. 

D. J. Waldie Jr. 

Long Beach, California 

Dear Sir: 

Galaxy was one of my favorite 
sf magazines and Robert Heinlein 
one of my favorite authors. 

Now Heinlein has descended to 
subtle pornography in I Will Fear 
No Evil, as well as becoming end- 
lessly boring — couldn't stomach 
finishing his serial. Many of your 
stories now seem selected with an 
eye to socialistic and left radical 
slants. You have both lost me for 
good. 

M. K. Johnson 
Omaha, Nebraska 

I hope you find it, Mr. Johnson 
—the good, that is. 

The letters in the above early 
sampling of views are presented in 
toto. More of these later as space 
permits. This report now spills 



over into some ground-covering 
sketching; 

1. A quick, overall reply to 
those who were curious and those 
who theorized other answers: I 
found the book brilliant, challeng- 
ing and highly pertinent on many 
levels. To enumerate them here 
would be pointless — it’s your ball 
now. 

2. It’s inconceivable to me that 
anyone except Robert A. Heinlein 
could or would have written / Will 
Fear No Evil. That’s my response 
to those of you who have written 
to ask; what if someone else had 
done so? 

No one else did. 

3. 1 also find it inconceivable 
that, having read the manuscript, I 
should not have made every effort 
to secure / Will Fear No Evil for 
first publication in Galaxy. 

Every worthwhile magazine 
makes its own demands of an edi- 
tor and Galaxy has a long history 
of being true to and reflecting the 
best in science fiction responsive to 
its times. 

This obligation covers a vast 
range of taste and talent, puts a 
certain emphasis on what science 
fiction has to say on top of the 
endless argument as to what sci- 
ence fiction is. It requires an ex- 
ploratory approach — and dialogue. 

So far, your comments — pro 
and con — regarding I Will Fear 
No Evil have been highly informa- 
tive. The same applies to your re- 
actions to Robert Silverberg’s Ur- 
ban Monad 116 series. All this 
constitutes the dialogue we must 
have. The conjunction of the works

TO FIT 
THE CRIME 



T he pot-bellied, graying man 
walked down the corridor to the 
psychiatrist's stateroom, one of the 
two such rooms in the interstellar 
vessel. He stood in the open door, 
then tapped lightly to get the man's 
attention. 

“You wanted to see me. Doc- 
tor?" 

“Yes, indeed. Dr. Crowell. 
Come in and sit down." 

“Thank you." Crowell sat on the 



edge of an overstuffed chair. 
“Syzygy. Aardvark, devil-worship. 
Gerund." 

Crowell blinked one long slow 
blink. Then he looked down at his 
belly in amazement. Experimental- 
ly he took a thumb and forefinger- 
ful of abdomen and pinched. 
“Ouch! Why didn't they have this 
old boy take off some weight 
before 1 got stuck with his 
persona'.’" 

“Necessary to the image, Otto.” 

“Otto yes, it all comes back 





JOEW. HALDEMAN 



now. I’m Otto McGavin, a — ” 
“Wait.” The psychiatrist strode 
to the stateroom door and eased it 
shut. “Continue.” 

“I’m a prime operator. A prime. 
For the TBII. And you are no more 
a psychiastrist than I am Dr. Isaac 
Crowell — you’re Sam, uh, Tibitz. 
Used to be a section leader when I 
was stationed on Springworld.” 
“That’s right, Otto — you have 
quite a memory. 1 don’t think we 
met more than twice.” 

“Three times. Two cocktail par- 



ties and a bridge game. Are you my 
briefing officer for this job?” 

“Right.” Tibitz reached into an 
inside vest pocket and pulled out a 
long envelope. He broke the plas- 
tic seal and handed it to Otto. 
“Five-minute ink,” he said. 

Otto scanned the three pages 
quickly and then read slowly from 
beginning to end. He handed it 
back just as the printing was start- 
ing to fade. 

“Questions?” 

“Okay. I’m fat old Crowell. Or 1

will be when you push me back 
through the mnemonic whatsis. 
May I assume 1 can speak the lan- 
guage as well as he could?” 
“Probably not- quite as well 
there aren’t any learning tapes for 
Bruuchian. Crowell’s the only per- 
son, prior to your indoctrination, 
who ever bothered to master a 
Bruuchian dialect. You were un- 
der mutual hypnosis with him for 
five weeks, learning it. Throat 
sore?” 

O tto reached to touch his 
adam’s apple, recoiled when he 
hit a flabby jowl. “God, this guy’s 
in lousy shape. Yeah, I feel a little 
tickle. Why?” 

“The language is mostly growls 
and belches. I learned a stock 
phrase in it; it goes like this ...” 
He made a noise like a lovesick 
rhinocerous. 

“What the hell does that mean?” 
“It’s in the same dialect you 
learned, a stock greeting in the in- 
formal mode: ‘Clouds are not for 
your family/ May you die in the 
sun.’ Of course, it rhymes in Bru- 
uchian. Almost everything rhymes 
in Bruuchian; every noun ends in 
the same syllable, a protracted 
belch.” 

“They say I’m pretty good at 
languages. Don’t know how long 
I’ll be able to keep that one up, 
though. I’ll be hoarse after half an 
hour’s small talk.” 

“No. You’ll remember when you 
get back into the Crowell persona. 



There’re some lozenges in your 
baggage kit that make it easier on 
your throat.” 

“Look, I hope this job won’t call 
for any action. I’ve had fourteen 
personality overlays be/ore this 
one, but I never had to carry this 
much plastiflesh around. That 
report said Crowell hadn’t been on 
the planet for ten years — why 
couldn’t they trim me down a little 
and say I’d gone on a diet?” 

“Too risky, you might run into 
some recent acquaintance. Be- 
sides, part of the job is for you to 
look as harmless as possible.” 

“I don’t mind looking harmless 
— but in one point two gees I’m 
going to be harmless. I worked up 
a sweat just walking down the cor- 
ridor here — and this is earth-nor- 
mal.” 

“We have confidence in you, Ot- 
to. You primes always come 
through in a pinch” 

“ — or die trying. It’s that damn 
hypnoconditioning.” 

“Now, Otto. You know it’s in 
your own best interests.” 

“Yeah, like poor old Carruth- 
ers.” 

Tibitz shrugged. “So he only has 
one natural limb left. He claims he 
enjoys the freedom of being able to 
choose the prosthetic to fit the job. 
He’s happy.” 

“He’s happy, all right. Last time 
I saw him, he passed me in the hall 
playing pattycake with left arms 
screwed into both shoulders. Hap- 

py-"

GALAXY 




"Well, he's not really a prime 
operator any more, either. He just 
carries the title as a courtesy.” 
“And what about ol’ Radar- 
eyes'?” 

“Sleep.” Otto slumped back in 
the chair and started to snore light- 
ly- 

“Otto, when I awaken you, you 
will be about ten percent Otto and 
ninety percent your artificial per- 
sonality overlay. Dr. Isaac Cro- 
well. You will remember your mis- 
sion and all of your training as a 
prime operator, but your initial 
reaction to any normal situation 
will be consistent with Crowell’s 
personality and knowledge. Only in 
stress situations will your reac- 
tions be those of a prime operator. 
Gerund. Devil-worship. Aardvark. 
Syzygy.” 

Crowell/McGavin awoke with a 
start. He pulled himself out of the 
chair and winked at Tibitz. In 
Crowell's gravelly voice: “Thank 
you very much. Dr. Sanchez. The 
therapy was most soothing.” 

“Think nothing of it. Dr. Cro- 
well. That's what the ship pays me 
for.” 

wrn HIS is an outrage! Young 
A man, do you know who I am ?” 
The customs inspector tried to 
look even more bored than usual. 
“Says here,” he peered at the mi- 
crofiche viewer that held Crowell's 
I D capsule, “that you’re Isaac Cro- 
well, Ph.D., out of Macrobastia, 
born on Terra. You're sixty years 



old and you look seventy. That 
don’t get you past the strip-down 
inspection.” 

“I demand to see your supervi- 
sor.” 

“Sorry, he ain’t in today. We got 
a little brig that you can wait in 
till tomorrow. I ain’t callin’ him 
up on his free day Just for some 
shy offworlder.” 

“Now, now — what seems to be 
the trouble?” A stocky little man 
with a foppish hairdo minced up. 
“Isaac! What brings you back to 
Bruuch'?” 

Crowell clasped the man’s hand 
— the palm felt like a woman’s 
thigh — and searched artificial 
memories for a fraction of a second 
until the face clicked. “Jonathan — 
Jonathan Lyndham. And how is 
Deirdre?” 

Lyndham sighed. “As ever. 1 
swear she’s out carrying a sign 
somewhere this very minute.” 
Deirdre was a lumpy Earth- 
mother type who, being childless, 
had adopted the natives of Bruuch 
and was forever crusading to 
better their lot. “But you — have 
you returned to stay this time'?” 

“I don’t know, Jonathan. This 
gentleman doesn’t even want to let 
me through the turnstile. Unless I 
do some sort of a — a striptease.” 

Lyndham glowered at the in- 
spector. “Smythe — don’t you 
know who this man is?” 

“He’s — nossir.” 

“Doctor Isaac Sebastian Cro- 
well,” he intoned, “author of

Anomaly Resolved, the book that 
put this pfanet on the regular 
spacelanes.” 

Actually the book had sold well 
enough on Bruuch and on Euphra- 
tes, where the qblonists faced a 
similar situation with regard to ex- 
ploiting a native population (and 
were looking for an excuse for slav- 
ery); but it had been a bust nearly 
everywhere else. Fellow anthro- 
pologists felt that Crowell had been 
sloppy and let sentiment interfere 
with objectivity. 

And as for being on the regular 
spacelanes, Bruuch was served by 
one cargo ship a week, passenger 
vessels if and when. 

"Here, let me see those papers.” 
The clerk gladly handed over the 
clearance forms. Lyndham 
scrawled initials in appropriate 
places. “This is no common 
smuggler . without the influence 
of his book, you would probably be 
working in the mines instead of 
shuffling papers once a week.” He 
pushed a button and the turnstile 
buzzed. “Come, Isaac. The 
Company will buy you a drink to 
atone for this cretin's stupidity.” 

Crowell squeezed through the 
turnstile and followed Lyndham to 
the spaceport bar. The place was 
furnished with native handcrafts, 
tables and chairs carved out of the 
dense black iron-wood that resem- 
bled obsidian more than it did any 
other Terran product. Crowell had 
difficulty drawing the chair out 
from the table. He plopped himself 



down and mopped his red face with 
an outlandishly large handkerchief. 

“Jonathan, I don’t know if I’ll be 
able to get used to this gravity 
again. I’m not a young many any 
more.” 

And ten percent reminded itself, 
I am twenty-seven and in superb 
physical condition. 

“You’ll get used to it, Isaac. I’ll 
enroll you in our health club — we’ll 
shrink those extra pounds off in no 
time.” 

“1 don’t know that I’ll have 
time,” Crowell said hastily; No 
amount of exercise will reduce 
plastijlesh. “My publisher Just sent 
me here to gather material for a 
revision of Anomaly. I doubt that 
I’ll be here more than a month.” 
“Oh — that’s a pity. But 1 think 
you’ll find that things have changed 
enough to warrant a longer stay 
than that.” An overdressed, dumpy 
waitress clumped over. She had a 
wad of something tucked in the 
side of one cheek. “You fellas want 
something to drink?” 

“Brandy, please. Do you still 
drink brandy, Isaac?” 

“Yes, indeed. With soda, if you 
please.” The girl nodded and 
walked away, masticating. 

“Changes? We hear very little of 
Bruuch on Macrobastia, where I’ve 
been teaching. I can see ten years 
have brought some changes — ” 
with an economical gesture he in- 
dicated the bar. “When I left last 
time this port was only packed 
earth and a metal hut. But I’m in-

GALAXY 




terested more in the true Bruuch- 
ians than in colonists. Are things 
much the same with them?” 

Lyndham pursed his lips. “Um 
— not really, Isaac.” 

The waitress brought drinks, one 
neat and one mixed. She gave each 
man the other’s order and stumped 
away without a word. The men 
switched and Crowell took a long 
swallow with obvious relish. 

“No brandy in the Confedera- 
tion like Bruuchian. A pity you 
don’t export.” 

“The Company’s supposed to be 
working on that. That and the na- 
tive handcrafts.” He twitched his 
shoulders in a little shrug. “So far 
just lots of talk. Kilogram for 
kilogram, they can make much 
more on rare earths. Every planet 
makes beverages and most have 
busy autochthones.” 

“Yes, the natives — things have 
changed?” 

J ONATHAN took a small sip of 
brandy and nodded. “Both in the 
long view and, well, recently. Have 
you heard that the natives’ average 
life span is down?” 

Otto McGavin knew but Cro- 
well shook his head, no. 

“In the past six years, down 
some twenty-five per cent. 1 think 
the average life expectancy of a 
male is down to about twelve years. 
Bruuchian, that is about sixteen 
Terran. Of course, they don’t seem 
to mind.” 

“Of course not,” Crowell mused. 



“They would view it as a blessing.” 
The Bruuchians preserved their 
dead in a secret rite and the 
carcasses were considered living 
creatures, with more status in the 
family than anyone who was still 
moving around. They were 
consulted as oracles, the eldest liv- 
ing family member divining their 
advice by studying the corpse’s im- 
mobile features. 

“Any theories?” 

“Well, most of the males work in 
the mines; there is some bismuth 
associated with the rare earth 
deposits; bismuth is a powerful 
cumulative poison to their sys- 
tems. But the mineralogists swear 
there’s not enough bismuth in the 
dust they breathe to cause any ap- 
preciable health problem. And of 
course the creatures won’t let us 
have a body for autopsy. It’s a 
sticky situation.” 

“Quite so, 1 can see. But I recall 
the Bruuchians enjoyed small doses 
of bismuth as a narcotic — could 
they have simply found a large 
source and be on a species-wide 
orgy?” 

“I don’t think so . I’ve looked 
into the matter rather closely — 
God knows, Deirdre’s always 
harping about it —and they simply 
don’t have the technology, even the 
most basic grasp of science, to 
extract or concentrate bismuth 
from any natural source. The 
Company doesn’t mine it and it’s 
against Company law to give any 
to a native even if you could find

any. No, I really think the bismuth 
poisoning is the wrong tack." 

“That's strange.” Crowell tap- 
ped a finger on the table, gathering 
his thoughts. “Except for that one 
metabolic quirk,, they seem quite a 
hardy people. Could it be over- 
work?” 

“No possibility, absolutely none. 
Ever since your book came out 
there’s been a Confederation ob- 
server, a xenobiologist, keeping 
track of the creatures.” Crowell 
winced microscopically every time 
Lyndham referred to the natives as 
“creatures.” “Every one of them 
that works in the mines has a serial 
number tattooed on his foot. 
They’re logged in and out and not 
allowed to spend more than eight 
hours a day in the mines. 
Otherwise they would, of course. 
Strange creatures.” 

“Yes, I noticed that when I first 
came here. It was the original 
stimulus for my research. In the 
home, they’re placid, even lazy. In 
places defined as work areas they’ll 
routinely labor to total exhaus- 
tion. It seemed, well, anti-survival. 
Took nine years’ work to find the 
answer.” 

T he Otto part of his brain was 
getting impatient. The disap- 
pearances? “You said something 
about recent changes?” 

“Um.” Jonathan fluttered his 
hands and he took another sip. 
“It’s really quite distressing. You 
know, we still have only about five 



hundred people on this planet.” 
“Oh? I had hoped that there 
would be more by now.” 

“Company doesn’t encourage 
immigration. No jobs. Anyhow, 
everybody knows just about every- 
body else; and we like to think that 
we’re a pretty close-knit group. 
More like a family than just peo- 
ple with a common employer. Any- 
how, people have been . miss- 
ing, disappearing over the past few 
months. The food supply is pretty 
closely managed; since humans 
can’t survive on native food and all 
meals are accounted for, the miss- 
ing people are presumed to be 
dead. But all of them disappeared 
without a trace. Three people, to 
date. One of them the supervisor of 
mines. Quite frankly, the general 
consensus is that the creatures did 
away with them for some 
reason — ” 

“Incredible.” 

“ —and as you might imagine, a 
good deal of bad feeling has been 
brewing. Several of the creatures 
have been killed.” 

“But—” Crowell sputtered, then 
sat back, took a drink and spoke 
calmly. “There is absolutely no 
way a Bruuchian can take a hu- 
man life. They don’t have the con- 
cept of killing for food. And as 
much as they revere their dead and 
aspire to be a ‘still one,’ they can't 
grasp the idea of murder or sui- 
cide — or even euthanasia. They 
don’t have words for these things. I 
remember a time when a drunken 



10 



GALAXY 




worker killed a clumsy Bruuchian 
with a shovel. I had to go to the 
village and find the proper house- 
hold, to try to explain. But the 
news got there before 1 did and the 
household was in a delirious state 
of celebration. Never had so young 
a one passed into stillness — they re- 
garded it as a special favor from 
the gods. Their only concern was to 
recover the body and preserve it 
and two of them were out on that 
chore as 1 arrived. When I told 
them that a man had done it, they 
thought I was jesting. Men are 
close to godhood, they said, but 
men are not gods. 1 tried to explain 
it over and over from different 
directions, but they only laughed. 
Finally they called in the neigh- 
bors and had me keep repeating 
the story for their edification. 
They regarded it as a wonderfully 
blasphemous Joke and it was told 
and retold for years.” 

Crowell emptied his glass in a 
gulp. 

‘T can’t say 1 disagree with 
you — the accusation is absurd. But 
they are powerful creatures and a 
lot of people are growing afraid of 
them.” 

“Well, this will certainly be my 
first, most urgent area of re- 
search.” Crowell levered himself 
out of the chair. “No, don’t get up. 

1 can find my way to Transients.” 

“Well — you know where to get 
in touch with me.” 

“Still in Supplies and Disbur- 
sal?” 



“Yes, indeed.” Lyndham smiled. 
“I’m at the very top now. Chief of 
Incoming.” 

“A belated congratulations,” 
Crowell said. Very interesting, 
Otto McGavin thought. 

II 

T he two- wheeled cart lurched 
to a stop and Crowell got out 
gingerly, heavily. He gave the na- 
tive who had pulled him over a mile 
a small coin of Company money 
and said in the formal mode: “For 
your labors/ this small token.” 

The native took it in a large 
trifurcate hand and placed the coin 
into his mouth, tonguing it to the 
voluminous pouch under his chin. 
He answered ritually, “May your 
body soon find the softness/the 
wisdom and ecstasy of stillness.” 
Then he scooped up Crowell’s bag- 
gage and carried it toward a door 
marked: Transient’s Billet #1. 

Crowell watched the native Jog 
ahead of him with more than a lit- 
tle envy as his large frame lum- 
bered down the walk. The Bru- 
uchian had a coat of short brown 
fur, now slightly misted with sweat. 
From the rear he resembled a 
Terran gorilla. 

His immense splayed feet were 
larger versions of the hands, with 
three mutually opposable toes. 
His legs were short in proportion 
to his body, with high knee Joints 
that allowed movement some 45° 
from the perpendicular in both

directions. Thus his gait had a 
cartoonish character, ampli- 
fied by the fact that his arms 
dropped straight from outsize 
shoulders to within a few centi- 
meters of the ground. There was 
nothing comic about his frontal 
aspect, though; with two huge 
glaring eyes that never blinked 
(through a transparent nictitating 
membrane slid up and back every 
few seconds) and the cluster of 
low-definition eyespots that, be- 
ing sensitive to infrared, al- 
lowed him to find his way in al- 
most total darkness. A huge 
mouth was covered by a single 
flap of a lip, which rose frequent- 
ly to show a set of improbably 
large molars. He had ears that 
would resemble a cocker span- 
iel’s, except that they were hair- 
less and heavily veined. 

This particular specimen sported 
two concessions to his human em- 
ployers: a pair of striking ear- 
rings and a loincloth concealing 
nothing of any conceivable in- 
terest to a human being. He also 
spoke two words of Terran, yes 
and no. That was about average. 

The native was in and out of the 
building before Crowell had huffed 
his way halfway there. He ran 
around Crowell without a word, 
harnessed himself to his cart and 
ambled off, a nightmare-comic 
jinrikisha. 

Crowell went into his billet and 
sank onto the spartan bunk. He 
had lived in more elegant sur- 



roundings. There were a crude 
table and chair of native manu- 
facture, an unimaginative print 
on the wall showing a winter 
scene on Terra, a military-type 
locker and shower operated by 
hoisting a bucket with holes 
punched in the bottom to head lev- 
el. Another bucket evidently 
served to transport water from 
some distant point to a washba- 
sin below a cracked mirror. There 
were no other sanitary facilities 
and Crowell assumed the out- 
house he remembered from ten 
years earlier was still in use. 

He was debating whether to re- 
cline on the bunk (he wasn’t sure he 
could get back up) when someone 
tapped on the door. 

“Come in,’’ he said wearily. 

A GANGLY young man with a 
small beard, wearing khaki 
shorts and shirt and carrying two 
bottles of beer, stepped diffidently 
to just inside the door. 

"I’m Waldo Struckheimer,’’ he 
said, as if that explained every- 
thing. 

“And you bring greatly needed 
succor,’’ Crowell rumbled. It had 
been a dusty ride. 

“I thought you might appreci- 
ate something to drink,” he said, 
loping across the room in two 
steps, offering a beer and standing 
about six heads over the seated 
Crowell. 

“Please — ” Crowell bobbed his 
hand in the direction of the native

chair and took a large swallow of 
beer while Waldo was folding 
himself into a sitting position. “Are 
you also a transient?" 

“Heavens, no,” said Waldo. 
“I’m the xenobiologist in charge of 
the natives’ welfare in the mines. 
And you, I understand, are Dr. 
Isaac Crowell. It's a pleasure fi- 
nally to meet you.” 

“The pleasure is all mine, I as- 
sure you.” Waldo took another 
drink. They made polite noises for 
a minute. “Dr. Struckheimer, I’ve 
only talked to one other person 
since I landed this morning. What 
he said was very alarming . .” 

“About the disappearances?” 
Waldo frowned. 

“That, too, but what concerned 
me most was the rapid decline in 
Bruuchian life expectancy. The 
theories I heard this morning 
weren’t too impressive — do you 
have any ideas?” 

Waldo put his fingertips togeth- 
er. “Well, my first idea was bis- 
muth poisoning; I suppose you 
heard about that. They do show 
most of the clinical signs, but 
they’re common ones — like nau- 
sea or shortness of breath in hu- 
mans. I mean, I would still strong- 
ly suspect bismuth poisoning if I 
had any idea where they could get 
it. But since we first learned it was 
toxic to them - 1 guess that was 
before you left nobody’s been 
allowed to bring bismuth onto 
the planet.” 

“And you don’t think there’s any

WE are getting to be a Very Big Cor- 
poration-something that was 
brought home at the Spring (Janu- 
ary) Sales Conference where Edi- 
torial valiently presented a six- 
month list (of something between 50 
and 60 titles per month), including of 
course Beagles and our new West 
Coast line, Comstock Editions. The 
festivities closed with an organic 
food supper— featuring natural 
grain alcohol— which was a smash. 

Enough.

SINCE this column is technically 
meant to trap you into buying books, 
we'll get on to a.f. and s.f. titles for 
March. A real goodie is Joy Chanf's 
RED MOON AND BLACK MOUN- 
TAIN— our second original Adult 
Fantasy— a powerful first novel 
which has already been compared 
with Tolkien which in tact it is total- 
ly unlike except perhaps in sta- 
ture. It is neither gothic, like GOR- 
MENGHAST, nor comfortably whole- 
some, like the Professor. RED MOON 
AND BLACK MOUNTAIN is wild, 
savage, magical, the first fruit of a 
major talent.

ALSO this month, two interesting 
cerebrations from Douglas R. Ma- 
son— HORIZON ALPHA— a vio- 
lently exciting variation on the 
theme of layered, cities, and DILA- 
TION EFFECT, a tense and moving 
fugue— really fwo separate love 
stories experienced by the same 
(well, not quite) couple. A very good 
book indeed . which, incidentally 
beautifully demonstrates Mason's 
developing skill as a writer.

IN this month, one of our favorite 
nuts, Augustus Mandrell, appears 
in three books— two reissues, one 
new. Pick them up if you've missed 
them before. OF ALL THE BLOODY 
CHEEK, RATHER A VICIOUS 
GENTLEMAN, and (new) FOR 
MURDER I CHARGE MORE. These 
are not mysteries— but if you liked 
Dr. Strangelove, Mandrell is for 
you. And at last, we do SOMETHING 
ABOUT EVE, by James Branch Ca- 
bell, originally announced last Fall, 
but postponed because our daunt- 
less leader disliked the cover fea- 
turing a flirtatious nude with a fea- 
thery bottom. Well, chacun i son

way it could be coming from the 
mines here?” 

“No. All the bismuth in ten cu- 
bic meters' of that lanthanide ore 
wouldn’t give a Bruuchian even a 
slight buzz. I’ve come to think it’s 
just a red herring; something else is 
causing similar symptoms.” 

“Any recent change in, well, 
their dietary habits, for instance?” 

“No, they still herd those meat- 
bearing reptimammals, and I’ve 
run a continuing analysis on the 
flesh pods they harvest from them. 
Nothing unusual. No bismuth, cer- 
tainly.” 

Both men sat in silence for a mo- 
ment. Crowell said, “Looks as if I 
may have a bigger job ahead of me 
than I had anticipated. My pub- 
lisher sent me here to update the 
book for a new edition — 1 ex- 
pected only to gather a few statis- 
tics and renew some old friend- 
ships.” He knuckled both eyes. 
“Quite frankly, the prospect of 
footwork is appalling. I’m not a 
young man any more and I weigh 
twenty kilos more than 1 did last 
time I was here. Even then I needed 
Gravitol to get around comfort- 
ably.” 

“I’m sure the Company doc- 
tor — you remember Dr. Nor- 
man — will prescribe you some. I 
use it myself when the days get too 
long.” He fumbled in a shirt pock- 
et and brought out a small vial. 
“Here, have a couple. I get it 
free.” 

“Many thanks.” Crowell put the 



14 



GALAXY 




two tablets under his tongue and 
washed them down sith a swig of 
beer. A feeling of lightness and 
well-being pulsed through him. 
“Ahh — potent stuff.” He stood 
without difficulty for the first 
time since he had been Otto Mc- 
Gavin. “Could 1 impose on you 
for a tour of your lab? That would 
seem to be a logical starting 
place.” 

“I’d be delighted — 1 planned to 
stop by there this afternoon any- 
how. Let’s try to catch a taxi.” 

W ALDO saw a jinrikisha a 
couple of blocks away and 
gave a piercing whistle. The driver 
saw them and ran down the street 
as if his life depended on it. 

He came to an abrupt stop and 
showered dust on both men. Then 
he grunted one syllable: “Where?” 
“Take-us-toMine-A-please.” 
The Bruuchian gave a disarm- 
ingly human nod. 

Mine A was a mile away. The 
ride was somewhat terrifying 
but otherwise uneventful. 

“Is that your lab?” Crowell in- 
dicated a large silver dome as he 
beat the dust from his clothes. 

“Yes, indeed. Here, follow me 
and by all means stay on the path. 
Wouldn’t want to step in a dust- 
pit.” 

No, wouldn't want to do that, 
Otto/Crowell thought as he care- 
fully matched the xenobiologist’s 
steps. Most of them are only about 
a meter deep — but slide into one 



of the big ones and you’re gone. 

With their infrared-sensitive 
eyeclusters the natives could detect 
the dustpits plainly by tem- 
perature differential. But to hu- 
man eyes the surface of a pit 
looked just like the surrounding 
dusty ground. 

Nearing the lab, Crowell heard 
the chugging of an air com- 
pressor. The dome wasn’t metal 
after all, but aluminized plastic, 
kept inflated by air pressure. 
That was something new in Com- 
pany buildings. They went 
through a flapdoor in the side. 

The air inside was sweet and 
cool. “Compressor pushes the air 
through a humidifier and a bunch 
of dust filters. I think the Company 
added that touch to induce me in- 
to free overtime. It works — I al- 
ways hate to leave the place.” 

The lab was an interesting com- 
bination of rustic and ultramod- 
ern. Every piece of furniture was 
the familiar Bruuchian design, but 
Crowell recognized the crinkly- 
gray box of an expensive general- 
purpose computer, a caloric oven, 
a large-screen electron microscope 
and a lot of complicated-looking 
glassware that had to be imported. 
He saw several arcane devices he 
couldn’t identify. 

“Very impressive — how did you 
ever get the Company to finance all 
of this?” 

Struckheimer laughed. “The 
Company just paid for the build- 
ing — hard enough to get that! I’ve

got a Confederation grant from the 
Public Health Commission. I'm 
the Company's veterinarian for 
six hours a day and the rest of the 
time 1 do research on Bruuchian 
physiology. Ot try to do re- 
search — I'm pretty limited with- 
out cadavers or even explora- 
tory operations." 

Crowell nodded. "How do you 
get volunteers — for whatever you 
do?" 

“Oh, I hire them. Bruuchians 
have developed a taste for some hu- 
man luxuries, like jewelry and 
hardware, and they can only get 
them at the Company store. I pay 
them exactly what they would get 
working in the mines — as you 
know, that’s not much. They stay 
here in a little room,” he indi- 
cated a partition with his thumb, 
“and I do quantitative bioan- 
alyses on them — you know, weigh- 
ing and analyzing food intake 
and waste products. I X-ray them 
and do organ traces 

E STROKED his beard and 
stared at nothing. “It’s very 
strange. They have several internal 
organs that don’t seem to have any 
real function. Not all of them even 
have the same set of organs. And 
if they do they aren’t necessarily 
the same place in the body cavity. 
If only I could get a cadaver!” He 
pounded his palm with his fist. “I 
— there was a horrible accident a 
few months ago. A native fell in 
front of a mining laser and it 



sliced him in two. As soon as I 
heard I came running. But the 
relatives had already spirited him 
away. I took an interpreter and 
found his family’s hut in the vil- 
lage. I told them I could sew him 
back together again, that I could 
cure him. God, I wanted to get a 
look at that body!” 

He kneaded his forehead with 
two fingers. “They believed me. 
And they apologized. But they said 
they had thought he was ready for 
stillness and they had already 
’processed’ him. “I asked if I 
could see his body and they said, 
sure, they were happy that 1 would 
want to join the celebration.” 
Struckheimer paused again. He 
stared at Crowell and said, “You 
know that room, the family room, 
where they keep their ancestor’s 
mummies? I went in there — must 
have been thirty or forty of them 
leaning against the walls, three and 
four deep, perfectly preserved. 
They pointed out the new arrival. 
He looked just like all the others, 
except for a hairless circle around 
his middle where the laser had cut 
through. I looked at the ring of 
skin closely — they let me use a 
flashlight — and there was abso- 
lutely no seam, no scar! I checked 
the serial number on the foot and 
it was the right one. Now, believe 
this: the cadaver couldn’t have 
gotten there ten minutes before I 
did. That kind of scar suppression 
takes induced skin regeneration 
— weeks of convalescence — and

you can’t do it on a dead organ- 
ism. But try to find out how they 
do it — you might as well ask a 
person how he keeps his heart 
beating. I don't think they really 
understand the question." 

Crowell nodded. “When I wrote 
my book, 1 had to be satisfied with 
a simple description of the phe- 
nomenon. All I could find out was 
that it involves some ritual using 
the oldest and the youngest fami- 
ly members. And nobody teaches 
them what to do. They say it’s ob- 
vious. But they can’t explain and 
they won’t let you watch.” 

Struckheimer went to a big free- 
standing refrigeration unit and 
came out with two beers. “Stand 
another one?’’ Crowell nodded 
and he uncorked both of them. 
“Make it myself one of the na- 
tive boys tends the brew for me. 
Going to lose him in a few months, 
though he’s almost old enough 
for the mines." 

He handed Crowell a beer and 
sat down on a little stool. “1 sup- 
pose you know they don’t have 
anything like a study of medicine. 
No shamans or anything. If some- 
body gets sick they just sit around 
and cheer him on — and if he re- 
covers they offer him their con- 
dolences.” 

“I know,” said Crowell. “How 
do you ever get them to come 
around for treatment? And how 
can you know what to do for them 
when they come in, for that mat- 
ter?” 



“Well, my medical assistants — 
I’ve got four — inspect each one of 
them when they go into the mine 
and again after they’ve finished 
work. The Public Health Com- 
mission designed a cybernetic re- 
mote diagnostic machine, similar 
to the one a doctor uses. There are 
four of them, all wired into my 
computer over there. It checks 
out their respiration rate, skin 
temperature, pulse and such; and 
if there’s any significant differ- 
ence between two consecutive 
readings my assistants send the 
fellow to me. By the time he gets 
here the computer has filled me in 
on his medical history and I can 
dope out some empirical remedy 
based on clinical experience and 
the physiological experiments. 1 
never have any idea whether the 
remedy is going to reduce the 
symptoms. A drug will work per- 
fectly on one of them and on the 
next the symptoms will just get 
worse and worse until he curls up 
and dies. And you know what they 
say about that.” 

“Yeah — he was ready for still- 
ness.” 

“Right — they tolerate the treat- 
ment only because it’s a condition 
for employment. They’d never 
come on their own.” 

“Have the diagnostic machines 
given you any clue as to the reason 
they’re dying off so much young- 
er than before?” 

“Oh, sure. Symptoms, in a sta- 
tistical sense. For instance, the av- 



TOFITTHECRIAAE 



17 




erage respiration rate has in- 
creased more than ten percent 
since we started taking readings. 
Average body temperature is up 
almost a degree. That supple- 
ments my clinical data; both to- 
gether led to my original conclu- 
sion that it was cumulative poi- 
soning. Bismuth would fit the 
data nicely — it all accumulates 
in one organ and is never ex- 
creted. And it has to be something 
associated with the mines. You 
know, they keep careful demo- 
graphic records; the families 
with the greatest number of re- 
cent additions to stillness have 
the most political power. It turns 
out that the life expectancy of 
those who don't work in the mines 
hasn’t changed a bit.” 

“I didn’t know that.” 

“The Company doesn’t like it 
spread around.” 

They talked for another hour, 
Crowell mostly listening, Otto de- 
veloping a plan. 

I T WAS almost dark when 
Crowell treaded up the walk to 
the doctor’s office. The Gravitol 
had worn off and he was feeling 
miserable again. 

The doctor’s office had the first 
modern furniture, a conservative 
chrome-and-plastic desk and the 
first pretty girl Crowell had seen on 
the planet. The girl sat behind the 
desk. 

“Do you have an appointment, 
sir?” 



“Uh — no, ma’m. But I’m an old 
friend of the doctor’s” 

“Isaac— Isaac Crowell! Come 
on back and say hello.” The voice 
came from a little intercom on the 
girl’s desk. 

“Last room down the corridor to 
your right, Mr. Crowell.” 

Dr. Norman met him in the cor- 
ridor and steered him to a differ- 
ent room, pumping his hand. “It’s 
been so long, Isaac I heard you 
were back and frankly, I was sur- 
prised. This is no planet for old- 
sters like us.” 

The doctor was an affable giant; 
red-faced and white-haired. He 
took Crowell into what were 
obviously his living quarters, a two- 
room apartment with a carpet and 
lots of old-fashioned books on the 
walls. When they entered, music 
started playing automatically; 
Crowell couldn’t identify it, but 
Otto knew: “Vivaldi,” he said 
without thinking. 

The doctor looked surprised. 
“Finally getting an education in 
your old age, Isaac? I remember 
when you thought Bach was just a 
kind of beer.” 

“I’m finding time for a lot of 
things now, Willy.” Crowell eased 
his bulk into an overstaffed chair. 
“All of them sedentary.” 

The doctor chuckled and strode 
into the kitchenette. He put ice in- 
to two glasses, measured brandy 
into each and splashed soda into 
one, water into the other. 

He handed the brandy and soda 



18 



GALAXY 




to Crowell. “Always remember a 
patient’s prescription,” he said. 

“As a matter of fact, that’s one 
thing I dropped by for.” Crowell 
took a sip from his drink. “I need a 
month’s supply of Gravitol.” 

The smile went off the doctor’s 
face and he sat down on the couch, 
putting his drink down without 
sampling it. “No, you don’t, 
Isaac. A week’s supply would be 
plenty. Then you’d be stone 
cold — dead.” 

“What?” 

“Obesity is a contraindication; 
at any rate, I never advise Gravitol 
for people over fifty-five. I never 
take it myself any more. It would 
strain the old ticker.” 

My heart is twenty-seven years 
old, McGavin thought, and it's car- 
rying around an extra thirty kilos. 
Think, think! 

“Is there some less potent drug 
that’d help me get around in this 
gravity? I’ve got a lot of work to 
do.” 

“Hmm — yes, Pandroxin isn’t 
nearly as dangerous, but it should 
give you a measure of comfort.” 
He reached into a drawer and 
brought out a prescription pad. 
He scribbled a short note. “Here 
you go. But stay away from that 
Gravitol. It would be pure poison 
to your system.” 

“Thanks. I’ll get it filled to- 
morrow.” 

“Tonight, if you want — the 
pharmacy part of the Company 
store’s open all night now. 



“So — what brings you back to 
this outlandish place, Isaac? In- 
vestigating the change in the Bru- 
uchian death rate?” 

“Not really — or not primarily. 1 
just came to update my book for a 
new edition. But that is one of the 
things I’ll want to look into. What 
do you think of the bismuth 
theory?” 

Willy waved a hand in the air. 
“Hogwash. I think it’s overwork, 
pure and simple. The little bas- 
tards work hard all day in the 
mines; then they go home and 
knock themselves out carving on 
that tough wood. You don’t have to 
look any farther than that.” 

“They always have seemed hell- 
bent on working themselves to 
death. The males, anyhow. Some- 
how, that seems too pat, though — 
the ones who don’t work in the 
mines are always charging around, 
too. But they aren’t popping off 
early.” 

T he doctor snorted. “Isaac, go 
down tomorrow and watch 
them work the mines. It’s a won- 
der they last even a week down 
there. The others look lazy com- 
pared to the mine workers.” 

“I’ll do that.” How to get the 
conversation around to the disap- 
pearances? “How about the hu- 
man side of the colony? Changed 
much since I left?” 

“Not really. Most of us got 
weasled into twelve- or twenty-year 
contracts; same people around, on-

ly ten years older. Costs a year’s 
salary to get back to Terra and 
you forfeit that one hundred per- 
cent retirement if you break your 
contract — so most of us are stick- 
ing it out. Had four people buy 
their way out; I don't think you 
knew any of them. There's a new 
Confederation ambassador — like 
the three before him, nothing 
for him to do here. But the 
law says we’ve got to have one — 1 
understand the diplomatic ser- 
vice considers this the least of all 
possible worlds and that being 
assigned here is either proof of 
imcompetence or punishment 
for something. It’s punishment 
for this one, Stu Fitz-Jones — he 
had the misfortune of being am- 
bassador to Lamarr’s World 
when the civil war broke out there. 
Not his fault, of course, it’s just 
that nobody understood the na- 
tives’ internal politics. But they 
had to hang it on somebody, so 
here he is. You ought to drop by 
and talk to him — he’s an interest- 
ing fellow. But go in the morning 
while he’s still a little bit sober. 
We’ve had six births, half of them 
legitimate, and eighteen deaths.’’ 
Willy frowned. “Rather, fifteen 
deaths and three disappearances. 
All the disappearances in the 
past year. People have been get- 
ting careless. Outside the Com- 
pany city you might as well be on 
another planet. But people go 
walking out alone, prospecting 
or Just getting away from the rest 



of us. They break a leg or step into 
a dust pit and it’s all over. Two of 
the disappearances were brand- 
new people, probably Confeder- 
ation agents — ” Otto jumped; 
Willy was right — “and the other 
was old Malatesta, the supervis- 
or of mines. I think that’s what 
brought the two agents. They were 
supposed to be doing miner- 
alogical research but they didn’t 
work for the Company. Who 
could have paid their way? No- 
body else can mine on this plan- 
et.’’ 

“Could be a University paying 
for abstract knowledge — that’s 
how I came here the first time.’’ 

The doctor nodded. “Exactly. 
That’s what they claimed. But they 
weren’t scholars, I could tell. 1 
lived and worked with academic 
people most of my life. Oh, they 
could identify themselves and 
they seemed to know their subjects 
adequately, but — you know that 
zombie thing the TBII is sup- 
posed to use with its agents?” 

“Vaguely — isn’t it just plastic 
surgery and hypno-learning?” 

“Oh, I suppose. Anyhow, that’s 
what 1 think these fellows were: a 
couple of agents they’d made to 
walk, talk and act like geologists. 
But they went to all the wrong 
places, like the mines — they’ve 
been analyzed and the analyses 
published down to the last mole- 
cule. And they never stuck to one 
place long enough to get any seri- 
ous work done.”

“You’re probably right.” 

“You think so? Have another 
drink. Everybody else around here 
thinks I’m getting paranoid in my 
old age.” 

“Maybe we’re both going bonk- 
ers together.” Isaac smiled. 
“Thanks for the offer, but I’d bet- 
ter pick up the Pandroxin and be 
getting back to my place before I 
collapse of fatigue. It’s been a 
long day.” 

“1 can imagine. Well, good to 
see you again, Isaac. Still play 
chess?” 

“Better than ever.” Especially 
with Otto’s help. 

“Well, drop by some evening 
after you’re settled and we’ll go a

“I’ll do that. Take care.”

“I’m going down to Dr. Nor- 
man’s office now to get some 
Gravitol. Those tablets you gave 
me today seemed just about 
right — could you look up the dos- 
age?” 



“Don’t have to look it up — it’s 
five milligrams. But look, Isaac, 
he’ll probably want you on a small- 
er dose — the older you get, the less 
they give you.” 

“Really? Well, I’ll try to talk 
him out of it. Seems to me it should 
go the other way around.” 

“You’ll never talk ol’ Willy out 
of anything — he’s about the most 
stubborn creature I’ve ever argued 
with.” 

“I know — we were good friends 
last time I was here. Maybe he’ll 
have pity on a fellow refugee from 
the geriatrics ward.” 

“Well, good luck. See you again 
soon?” 

“I’ll be down your way tomor- 
row, checking out the mines.” 

“Stop in for a beer.” 

“Glad to.” 

Crowell emptied his suitcase and 
flipped up the false bottom. He 
selected a stylus that Was an 
ordinary ball-feed pen on one side 
and an ultrasonic ink eradicator on 
the other. Luckily, the doctor had 
used a black ball-feed to write the 
prescription; he wouldn’t have to 
forge the signature. 

He practiced writing: “5 mg. 
Gravitol, quant suff 30 days” a 
couple of dozen times, then 
buzzed the Pandroxin prescrip- 
tion into invisibility and 
scrawled the counterfeit one over 
the doctor’s signature. 

The Company store was dark 
except for one light over the pre- 
scription desk. The front door was 



TOFITTHECRIAAE

locked and Crowell dragged him- 
self over to a side door. It slid open 
when he put his foot on the treadle 
mat. A bell rang. 

A clerk came from behind the 
shelves of reagents, rubbing sleep 
from his eyes. “Something I can do 
for you?” 

“Yes, I’d like this filled, please.” 

“Sure thing.” The young man 
took it and walked back behind 
the shelves. “Say,” he yelled back, 
“this isn’t for you, is it?” 

All Otto now. “Of course not. 1 
use Pandroxin. That’s for Dr. 
Struckheimer.” 

The clerk came back in a min- 
ute with a little green vial. “1 could 
have sworn Waldo was in here for 
Gravitol just last week. Maybe 1 
ought to call up Dr. Norman.” 

“I don’t think these are for his 
own use,” Crowell said slowly. 
“They’re for some experiment on 
the natives.” 

“Okay. I’ll just put it on his ac- 
count, then.” 

“That’s funny. He gave me cash 
to pick them up.” 

The clerk looked at him. “How 
much?” 

“How much do they cost?” 

“Eighteen and a half credits.” 

Crowell extracted his wallet and 
counted out nineteen credits. Then 
he laid out a pink Cr50 bill next to 
it. 

The clerk hesitated, then picked 
up the Cr50, folded it and put it 
into his pocket. “It’s your funeral, 
old-timer,” he said as he rang up 



the purchase. “That’s a young 
man’s dosage.” 

Crowell took the half-credit 
change and left without a word. 

T he next morning, feeling hu- 
man again, Crowell went out to 
the mines, just after sunup. He 
checked at the dome but Waldo 
wasn’t there, so he ambled on down 
to Mine A. 

A long line of Bruuchians waited 
at the entrance to the mine, danc- 
ing and gesticulating as if they 
were trying to keep warm. The 
noise of their animated conver- 
sation got louder and louder as 
Crowell approached the front of 
the line. 

A human in white coveralls was 
examining the lead Bruuchian. He 
didn’t notice Crowell until he was 
standing right next to him. 

“Hello there,” Crowell shouted 
over the din. 

The man looked up, startled. 
“Who the hell are you?” 

“Name’s Crowell — Isaac Cro- 
well.” 

“Oh, yeah — 1 was just a kid last 
time you were here. Watch this.” 
He picked up a megaphone and 
shouted in Bruuchian (informal 
mode): “Your spirit/disrupts my 
spirit/slowing the progress/of this 
line and your way to stillness.” The 
conversation quieted to a low mur- 
mur. “See, 1 read your book.” 
“Clever adaptation. You could 
be one of their priests.” 

“They think I am one.” He con- 



22

tinued making passes over the Bru- 
uchian’s body with a gleaming 
metal probe. 

“Is that the diagnostic ma- 
chine?” Crowell indicated a fea- 
tureless black box clipped to the 
man’s belt, with a cable leading to 
the probe. 

“Yeah. It figures out whether 
anything’s wrong with the beastie 
and tells Doc Struckheimer.” He 
clapped the Bruuchian on the 
shoulder; the ‘beastie’ ran off into 
the mine. The next stepped up and 
presented his foot, his knee bend- 
ing in a most unkneelike manner. 
“It’s also a microphone,” he said, 
peering at the number tattooed 
on the Bruuchian’s foot. He read 
the number off in slow, clear tones 
and began running the probe over 
the brown fur in a regular pat- 
tern. 

“I can’t figure anybody getting 
off this planet and wanting to come 
back. What are you doing here?” 

“Well, there’s a new printing of 
my book coming out. The pub- 
lisher wants it updated.” 

The man shrugged. “Long as 
you get a ticket back, guess it’s not 
so bad. “If you want a look down- 
stairs, go ahead. But watch your 
step. They run around like crazy 
down there — keep away from the 
elevator and they probably won’t 
trample you.” 

“Thanks.” Crowell walked down 
the corridor to a small open ele- 
vator. Inside, one Bruuchian was 
doing an impatient little dance. 



Over the elevator, a sign in En- 
glish read: TWO AT A TIME. 
Bruuchians had no written lan- 
guage, but this one must have 
known the rule; as soon as Crowell 
strapped himself in the native 
pushed a big red button and the 
elevator fell abruptly. Crowell 
hung on while Otto counted dis- 
passionately. Twenty-two sec- 
onds passed before the repulsors 
cut on and the machine squeezed 
to a halt. Even allowing for air re- 
sistance, they must be over a kilo- 
meter deep. 

T he place was very dark. 

The Bruuchians did not need as 
much light as Terrans. He could 
hear activity all around, as the 
Bruuchian shouldered past him, 
but he couldn’t see anything. 

“Well, well,” said a human voice 
about three or four meters away. 
“Welcome to the mines.” 

A flashlight flared on and the 
light bobbed up to Crowell. “Here, 
put these on.” Crowell was handed 
a pair of goggles. 

The interior of the mine sprang 
into view, in a ghostly green and 
gray video image. “Nightglasses, 
light amplifiers,” the voice said. 

“Waldo — I didn't know you 
were down here.” 

He chuckled. “You wouldn’t 
have seen much if I weren’t. I was 
about to call up — didn’t expect you 
this early.” 

“It is rather early.” 

Crowell looked around. The 



TOFITTHECRIME 



23 




mine was somewhat larger than his 
preconception of it. It was a rough- 
ly square cavern the size of a large 
hall. Some twenty Bruuchians 
were working one corner with vi- 
bropicks and shovels. Next to the 
elevator was a rack of similar 
tools, probably fifty of each. 

“Are all of those workers up 
there coming down to this one 
mine?” 

“Oh, yes. We only work one lev- 
el at a time. Strangely, they seem 
to work better in a mob — wait’ll 
you see it, it's quite a spectacle. 
About forty of them with picks 
and forty with shovels and twen- 
ty with barrows, working in a 
white frenzy from the time they get 
here until the time they leave, ex- 
cept for chow breaks. And we have 
to make them stop by turning off 
their picks.” 

In about half an hour the cavern 
was full, with teams of twos even- 
ly spaced around three walls. A 
barrow served each pair of teams. 
As soon as the barrow was full, the 
Bruuchian who had been fidget- 
ing beside it would tear off to the 
fourth wall — where Crowell and 
Struckheimer were standing— and 
dump the ore into a conveyer that 
took it to the surface. Then he 
would return and pick up a shovel; 
the former shoveler would get the 
vibropick and the pickmeister 
would go fidget beside the barrow. 
In the midst of all this activity a 
small Bruuchian scurried back and 
forth, scattering what appeared 



to be a mixture of sand and saw- 
dust on the damp cave floor, nar- 
rowly escaping collision every few 
seconds. There was a zany order to 
it, like a group of little children 
knocking themselves out in a com- 
plicated relay race. 

“You know,” Crowell said, “Dr. 
Norman thinks the decline in life 
expectancy is due to simple 
overwork. Looking at this. I’m 
inclined to agree with him.” 

“Well, they do work harder at 
this than anything else I’ve seen 
them do. I don’t know whether it’s 
the cool and darkness or what. 
Some wag said that the cavern is 
some kind of a womb-symbol to 
them. I’m willing to ignore that 
until some concrete evidence 
comes along. As you well know, we 
don’t have anything approaching 
a systematic psychology for these 
people. “But overwork? I don’t 
think so. We force them to rest 
three times a day. Their women 
bring meatfruit to the mines and 
we feed them at each break. Eat- 
ing calms them down for about 
twenty minutes. And I won’t let 
the Company work them more 
than eight hours a day. When 1 
came here they were working 
twelve.” 

“How much power do you have 
over the Company?” 

“In theory, they should jump 
when I say frog. Their contract 
here is at the sufferance of the Con- 
federation Public Health Com- 
mission. But I don’t overdo it. I 



24 



GALAXY 




have to depend on them for sup- 
plies, manpower and so forth. It’s 
a pretty cordial relationship — 
but they know there are five or six 
other concerns ready to snap up 
the contract if they make a mistake. 
So they’re pretty good in their 
treatment of the natives.” 

“Hmm — you mean they’re ac- 
tually working less than they did 
when their life expectancy was 
higher?” 

Waldo laughed. “I know what 
you’re thinking. No, it can’t be a 
case of atrophic degeneration; that 
would show up in the lab tests — be- 
sides, they work less in the mines 
now, but more in the village. You 
wouldn’t recognize the place. 
Skyscrapers and — ” 

“Skyscrapers?” 

“Well, that’s what we call 
them — mud and straw buildings 
two, sometimes three stories 
high. It’s another mystery. They 
have all the room in the world to 
expand their village radially. But 
somewhere they got the idea to go 
up instead of out. And it’s quite a 
job; mud and straw just aren’t 
made to take that kind of stress. 
Now when they build a house they 
have to reinforce the whole thing 
with ironwood — it’s almost a 
wooden building covered with a 
layer of mud. Say maybe you 
can find out why they’re doing it. 
Nobody here’s been able to get a 
straight answer out of them. But 
you can speak the dialect better 
than any of us. Besides, you’re 



kind of a folk hero to them — even 
though I don’t think any of these 
were alive last time you were here. 
They know you were responsible 
for a lot of the changes in their lives 
and they’re grateful.” 

It was damp and cold and 
Crowell shivered. “For bringing 
them closer to stillness,” he said. 

Waldo said nothing. There was a 
rumble and the elevator came to 
rest behind them. “Hi, boss. Hi, 
Dr. Crowell. Well, I brought the 
beastie’s meat. Want I should turn 
’em off?” 

Waldo looked at his watch. 
“Sure, go ahead.” 

The assistant threw a switch 
mounted on the elevator housing 
and the vibropicks stopped sing- 
ing. For a while there was a chorus 
of ragged chunk-sounds as the 
workers tried to keep going des- 
pite loss of power. Then by ones 
and twos, they formed up a line at 
the elevator. The assistant gave 
each one a large meatfruit which 
he would take back to his work 
area. The crews would each squat 
in a circle, munching and talking 
in low grunts. 

“Well, we’re not needed around 
here,” said Waldo. “How would 
you like to take a look at the vil- 
lage?” 

“Fine, fine. Just let me stop by 
my billet to pick up my notebook 
and camera.” 

“We’ll go by the lab and get a 
couple of beers, too. It’s hot up 
stairs.” 



TOFITTHECRIME

T he sun was blistering hot when 
the cart skidded to a stop out- 
side the village, ending the breeze 
that had made the trip livable. 

Crowell wiped the sweat and 
caked dust from his face and took 
a final swig of beer. 

“What’ll we do with the emp- 
ties?” 

“Oh, just leave them in the cart. 
This is the fellow who tends the 
heer for me; he’ll drop them off at 
the lab.” 

Crowell heaved his bulk to the 
ground. 

“God, it’s hot.” 

Waldo squinted at the sun. “It’ll 
be better in a couple of hours. 1 
suggest we find some shade.” 

“Suits me.” They went through 
the village gate and started walk- 
ing down the path. They couldn’t 
see anything but the grass, taller 
than a man, that surrounded the 
village in all directions for half a 
kilometer. Vehicles couldn’t come 
in closer, in consideration for the 
skittish reptimammals that grazed 
here. 

The beasts didn’t seem to mind 
people walking through, though; 
Crowell and Struckheimer saw 
several of them, placidly gnawing 
the grass, watching the humans 
from stalked eyes as they walked 
by. Most of them were over ten 
feet long, half of that length being 
unproductive tail and neck. But 
from their backs lolled strings of 
the meatfruit that formed the sta- 
ple of the Bruuchian diet. Every 



female (the males were set loose 
soon after birth and only let in- 
side the compound for stud) sup- 
plied about thirty kilograms of 
meatfruit per season; every family 
had at least three or four of the 
creatures. Tending and harvesting 
the beasts was the major respon- 
sibility of the females. 

The reptimammals were con- 
sidered more than a source of 
meat, more than pets; they were 
actually low-status family mem- 
bers. They were “second-class citi- 
zens” because they couldn’t speak 
and, more important, couldn’t as- 
pire to stillness — they simply died. 
But the Bruuchians didn’t eat the 
flesh of the dead reptimammals. 
They buried them with ceremony 
and mourning. 

A native came loping down the 
trail toward them, moving much 
more slowly than the ones in the 
Company city did. He stopped in 
front of them and said in the in- 
formal mode: 

“You are Crowell-who-jests and 
you are Struckheimer-who-slows/ 
1 am young one called Baluurn/ 
Sent to guide you on this visit.” 

His little speech over, the little 
Bruuchian fell in beside the two 
humans, trying to match steps 
with Crowell. 

“1 know this one,” Struckheim- 
er said. “He’s learned quite a bit 
of English. He’s been my inter- 
preter before.” 

“That right,” the creature 
belched in a strange burlesque of 



26 



GALAXY 




human speech. “All time in — 
creche I hear tapes you-Crowell 
leave." 

This startled Crowell. He strug- 
gled with the informal mode: “The 
creche is for teaching/the rituals 
of life and stillness/ Did you fore- 
go the teaching of your ancestors 
/in learning to speak with hu- 
mans?” 

“The priest vouchsafed me/my 
soul a special path to stillness/ 
and gave over my role as youngest/ 
to one of my brothers/so that my 
time and mind could/be used to 
plumb/the ways and tongue of 
humans.” 

“What was that all about?” 

“Well, he evidently had to use 
most of his learning year studying 
English -he said the priest gave 
him some sort of dispensation 
from learning the social rites. 
That usually takes most of their 
year.” 

“What word 'di-pensa-un' 
mean?” 

“It's like 'permission,' Baluurn, 
but from a priest,” Struckheimer 
said. 

“That right. Priest give dipesa’un 
so I not-like brothers.” 

“Your English is very good, Bal- 
uurn. I studied your tongue for 
ten years and can't speak it as 
well as you speak mine.” 

Baluurn bounced his head in a 
nod. “Struckheimer - who - slows 
says human not-like Bruuchian. 
Learn more all long life but never 
so much one year. Must be for 



Bruuchian go into stillness much 
sooner than human.” 

T he grass was thinning out and 
they could see the village ahead. 
Crowell immediately saw what 
Struckheimer meant — only about 
half of the dwellings were the 
familiar asymmetric mud-and- 
wattle construction. The newer 
ones were all almost rectangular 
and up to ten meters high. 

“Baluurn, why did your people 
stop building the old way?” 

The Bruuchian looked at the 
ground and seemed to be concen- 
trating on not getting ahead of the 
humans. “It new-kind — new part 
living ritual. Leave still ones near 
ground. Pass many time each day. 
Live above so pass still ones many 
time. Talk to still ones, still ones 
know more, still ones happier and 
more useful.” 

“1 guess it makes sense,” Wal- 
do said with a straight face. “You 
couldn't expect them to know 
what was going on, locked up in a 
back room.” 

“Oh, never locked. Lock human 
word, no Bruuchian. But you right, 
still ones more useful.” 

Crowell fingered the small 
camera clipped to his belt. This 
could get in the way of one of his 
ideas. “I thought it was forbidden 
to move a still one; a new family 
had to be started if you moved 
one.” 

“That true, very true. New house 
built around old house. Take off 



TO FITTHE CRIME

old roof, leave hole in living house 
floor, buy rope Company store, 
pass by still ones climbing up and 
down many time every day." 

“Quite so.” Crowell took the 
camera from his belt and took 
some picture of the buildings. 
Then he scribbled descriptions of 
each picture in his notebook. Pro- 
tective coloration. 

“For some reason they must 
want to have larger famflies,” 
Waldo said. “I know they used to 
split the still ones and the family 
when it got too crowded and start a 
new family on the outskirts of the 
village.” 

A native woman walked by, 
leading two docile repti- 
mammals. The fresh brown ooze 
on their backs showed they had just 
been pruned. Crowell snapped a 
picture. 

“Larger families, maybe. But 
this building up instead of out al- 
so preserves grassland; that might 
be important.” Baluurn was silent 
through this exchange — he was 
used to humarts going off in 
sudden non sequiturs . He knew 
why they were building up, just as 
he had told them. It was part of the 
living ritual, now. 

“Crowell- who-jests?” 

“Yes, Baluurn?” 

“One family asked you visit. 
Old, very old woman remembers 
you. Would speak you before still- 
ness, very soon.” 

“Say, that’s odd. 1 asked them if 
anyone remembered you and they 



said all had passed into stillness.” 

Crowell smiled. “You used the 
formal mode, right?” 

“Sure, you can handle the oth- 
er?” 

“Well, they probably misunder- 
stood you, then. It's hard to talk 
about females in the formal mode, 
requires a certain amount of cir- 
cumlocution. They thought you 
were asking if any men who re- 
membered me were still alive.” 

“Crowell-who-jests is right. 
Struckheimer-who-slows should 
sent for me talk. All village know 
old Shuurna.” 

“Well, let’s go to see her. Should 
be interesting.” 

The ground floor entrance was 
like a double door, the two men 
and the Bruuchian going first into 
the new building. They were 
standing in a big room filled from 
floor to ceiling with the old family 
hut. Baluurn stood at the doorway 
of the hut and called out the ritual 
of entrance. Someone upstairs 
responded and they went in the sec- 
ond door. 

“I go up first see Shuurna ready 
speak Crowell.” 

Baluurn clambered up the rope. 
Crowell looked at it doubtfully; 
took another Gravitol and 
swallowed it. 

They were surrounded by a 
couple of dozen still ones, open 
eyes regarding them with un- 
readable expressions. 

When Baluurn disappeared into 
the upper floor, Crowell took 



28 



GALAXY 




something from his pocket and 
walked to one of the still ones rest- 
ing against the wall. 

“What are you doing, Isaac?” 
“Just a second,” Isaac whis- 
pered, reaching behind the still 
one. He returned and handed a 
small plastic envelope to Waldo. 
He put a small vibroknife back in 
his pocket. “A scraping from the 
shoulder,” he whispered. 

Waldo’s eyes grew round. “Do 
you know — ” 

Baluurn was sliding back down 
the rope. Two others followed 
him. “Shuurna wants speak 
Crowell-who-jests alone.” 

“Well, I’m game,” he said. “If I 
can make it up that rope.” 

Crowell got a good grip and 
heaved himself up, catching the 
slack end between his feet. With 
an extra Gravitol in him, it wasn’t 
really hard, but he huffed and 
muttered and went up very slowly. 

S HUURNA was lying on a 
woven mat. She was the oldest 
Bruuchian Crowell had ever seen, 
hair yellowed and falling out in 
patches, eyes clouded with blind- 
ness, shrunken dugs loose gray 
flaps of flesh. She spoke the in- 
formal mode in a weak voice. 

“Crowell-who-jests / I knew you 
in my year of learning / so I re- 
member you better than my own 
children / you walk differently 
now / your steps seem a young 
man’s steps.” 



“The years have been kinder to / 
me than to you / Shuurna who 
awaits stillness / this apparent 
youth though / is from an herb / 
the doctor gave me to / give me 
the strength of a younger man.” 
This was something Crowell hadn’t 
foreseen. 

“My large-eyes are darkened / 
but my many-eyes tell me / that 
you are taller by two kernels / Cro- 
well-who-jests / than you were my 
lifetime ago.” 

“This is so / it is something that 
may / happen to a human as he 
ages.” You could add centime- 
ters with plastiflesh, but you 
couldn’t take them off. 

There was a long silence that 
would have been considered awk- 
ward in human society. 

“Shuurna / do you have some- 
thing to / tell me or ask me?” 
Another long pause. “No / you 
who look like Crowell-who-jests / I 
waited to see you / but now you are 
not here / please summon the 
youngest and the new oldest.” 
Crowell walked to the rope. 
“Baluur!” 

“Yes, Crowell-who-jests.” 
“Shuurna is ready to — pass into 
stillness. Can you find the oldest 
and the youngest?” 

The two who had come down 
with Baluur scampered back up the 
rope. They walked past Crowell 
and stood before Shuurna. 
Crowell started to leave. 

“Crowell-who-jests,” the older 
one spoke, “ / would you help us / 



TOFITTHECRIME 



29 




with our joyful burden / I am too 
old and this one is too small / to 
carry Shuurna / to join the other 
still ones downstairs.” 

Other still ones? Crowell went 
over to the three and stooped to 
take Shuurna^s hand. It was solid, 
unyielding as wood. 

“Old man in the family of Shu- 
urna / I do not understand / I 
thought no humans could be 
present during / the stillness 
ritual.” 

The old man nodded in that dis- 
armingly human way. “This was 
so / until not-long ago / when the 
priests told us of the change / to 
my poor knowledge / you are only 
the second human / to be so hon- 
ored.” 

Crowell took up Shuurna’s body 
unceremoniously, a hand under 
stiff arm and thigh. “And who was 
the other fortunate human?” 

The old one had his back to Cro- 
well, following the youngster who 
was scampering to the rope. “I was 
not there / but I was told / it was 
Malatesta-the-highest.” 

Malatesta, the last supervisor of 
the mines — and the first disap- 
pearance. 

The rope threaded through an 
iron ring (also purchased at the 
Company store), and normally 
hung as a single strand, a stick tied 
to one end preventing it from 
slipping through the ring. Crowder 
balanced Shuurna’s corpse on its 
feet and the old one passed the rope 
under her arms, securing it with 



something that was almost a 
square knot. They passed the body 
down to Baluur, who untied it and, 
balancing it with one hand, pulled 
in slack until the rope was in its 
original position. Then the two 
Bruuchians clambered down, 
hand over hand. Crowell followed 
with a little less confidence. 

During the whole process, 
Waldo had stood to one side, 
looking rather lost. The old one 
addressed Crowell in the informal 
mode and Crowell replied with 
what Waldo recognized as a 
polite refusal. 

“Uh — what was that all about?” 
“We were invited to the wake, 
you know, recite all the good deeds 
the old gal was responsible for and 
help decide where to lean the body. 
1 told them no, thanks. These af- 
fairs last all day and I’ve got an ap- 
pointment. Besides, I’ve always 
gotten the feeling that having hu- 
mans present puts a damper on the 
festivities. They have to invite 
you, of course, if you’re anywhere 
nearby when the thing starts.” 
“And we’re about as near as 
anybody’s ever been. Glad you 
didn’t accept for us — this whole 
business has gotten me a little 
queasy.” 

“Well, we can leave any time. 
Baluur’s staying, naturally.” 

“Let’s go.” 

T he sun was still blazing over- 
head when they stepped out of 
the hut. The whole experience

couldn't have taken more than half 
an hour. They had walked down 
the dusty road a few meters before 
Waldo spoke in a hoarse whisper. 

“That sample you gave 
me — what makes you think they 
won’t find out you took it?’’ 

“Don’t be so damned furtive! 
We’re just tourists, right? You’d 
need a magnifying glass to find 
where 1 made the incision. Be- 
sides, I took it from one of the last 
accessible corpses, right up 
against a wall — with their tabu 
against moving them, we’re safe.’’ 
“Well, I’ll have to admit it is a 
windfall. Maybe we can finally 
figure out how — say, you were 
there when the woman died! Did 
you see anything?” 

Crowell stared at the ground for 
a few steps before replying. “I was 
leaving, backing out; I was sure 
they didn’t want me around. But 
they Just went up to her and looked 
at her and said it was done. What- 
ever kind of embalming they do, 
they must do it while the person’s 
still alive.” Crowell shuddered in 
the heat. “They didn’t even touch 
her.” 

IV 

C ROWELL had deliberately ig- 
nored Dr. Norman’s advice and 
had made an appointment with the 
ambassador in the early evening. 
He expected the man would be 
pretty intoxicated by then. A 
strikingly handsome man, aris- 



tocratic features, gray hair flo 
ing onto broad shoulders, an- 
swered the door. 

“Ambassador Fitz-Jones?” 

“Yes — oh, you must be Dr. Cro- 
well. Come in, come in.” He didn’t 
seem too far gone. 

Crowell walked into an elegant- 
ly appointed room, which the Otto 
part of his mind identified as being 
furnished in American Provin- 
cial, late 20th Century. Even if the 
furnishings were fakes the ship- 
ping costs were staggering to con- 
template. 

Fitz-Jones indicated an amor- 
phous leather-covered chair, and 
Crowell allowed it to swallow him. 
“Let me get you a drink. You may 
have brandy and water, brandy and 
soda, brandy and juice, brandy and 
ice, brandy and brandy, or — ” he 
gave a conspiratorial wink — “a 
bit of Chateau Mouton Roths- 
child of ’sixty-one vintage.” 

Even Crowell knew what that 
vintage represented. He murmured 
an appropriate comment. 

“Somehow a small cask of it was 
mistakenly delivered here, instead 
of a case of badly needed immi- 
gration forms.” Fitz-Jones shook 
his head gravely. “These things are 
inevitable concarp — ah — con- 

comitants of trying to operate 
within the framework of an in- 
terstellar bureaucracy. We learn 
to adjust.” 

Crowell revised his earlier esti- 
mate. Fitz-Jones could well have 
been adjusting all day.

“That sounds wonderful.” 

He watched the man’s careful 
steps and marveled at the human 
organism’s ability to cope with 
proven toxins. 

The ambassador produced two 
highball glasses filled with the 
deep red wine. “No proper glass- 
ware, of course. Perhaps it’s just 
as well. ’Sixty-one doesn’t 
travel well, you know — and it 
won’t keep; have to drink it up 
quickly.” 

It tasted quite good to Crowell, 
but Otto could tell that it was rath- 
er bruised. Barbarous treatment 
for the wine of the century. 

Fitz-Jones took a delicate sip 
that somehow managed to deprive 
the tumbler of two centimeters 
of wine. “Did you have anything 
specific to see me about — not that 
1 don’t enjoy company whenever 
it comes my way.” 

“Guess 1 just wanted to meet 
somebody else who wasn’t work- 
ing for the Company. I need an 
outsider’s view of what’s been hap- 
pening the past ten years. Quite a 
bit has been, I understand.” 

Fitz-Jones made an expansive 
gesture that came within a 
millimeter of spilling wine. Otto 
could appreciate the years of 
practice that had gone into the per- 
fection of that ploy. “Not really, 
not really — at least until a year 
ago, of course. Until then life here 
was just the workaday grind of 
running this, you’ll excuse the ex- 
pression, world. Absolutely 



nothing for me to do while every- 
body else kept the sweatshop work- 
ing. Submit a blank report twice a 
year. Then we had the disappear- 
ances, of course. Superinten- 
dant Malatesta was the official 
head, titular ruler, of this planet, 
so you can imagine the paper- 
work I went through. 1 was on the 
subspace radio for hours every 
day, until the -can you keep a se- 
cret, Dr. Crowell?” 

“As well as the next man, 1 sup- 
pose.” 

“Well, it’s not really a secret any 
more, since the doctor — Dr. Nor- 
man, that is — figured it out. It’s 
probably all around the Company 
by now. Anyhow, I talked to the 
Confederation officials on Ter- 
ra and they agreed to send a couple 
of TBll men to investigate. 
Well, they came here — gave a 
splendid imitation of two scien- 
tific chaps — and while they were 
poking around, they disap- 
peared, too.” 

“The two geologists?” 
“Precisely. And you’d think 
that, with two of their men gone, 
the TBII would send an army down 
here to see what’s going on. But no. 
I finally talked to some undersec- 
retary and he told me they simply 
couldn’t afford any more men for 
our 'petty intrigues’ on Bruuch.” 
“That’s odd.” The first item in 
the one report the agents had filed 
had been a warning about the un- 
trustworthiness of the ambas- 
sador. 



32 



GALAXY 




“Indeed. So 1 don’t think the 
agents disappeared the way Mala- 
testa did — you know, died. They 
must have had a light cruiser hid- 
den off somewhere and when they 
found what they were after — they 
just left. Damned frustrating, you 
know; we still haven’t the faintest 
idea of what happened to Mala- 
testa. I’m certain that they found 
out.” 

It’s quite likely they did find out, 
Otto thought. “Couldn’t the TBIl 
have sent more agents without 
telling you?” 

“No, impossible; violation of 
Confederation law. I’m the sole 
federal official on this planet. 1 
must be notified. And besides, 
only two people have come in 
since the agents disappeared. One 
was Dr. Struckheimer’s new as- 
sistant; I’ve kept my eye on him. I 
think he must be just what he says 
he is, dull fellow, really. The other 
newcomer, of course, is you. 

C ROWELL chuckled. “Well, I 
rather fancy being a spy. Will 
you ply me with wine frequently, 
then?” 

Fitz-Jones smiled, but his eyes 
were cold. “Of course — as I said, it 
won’t keep. Confidentially, I am 
rather expecting another agent to 
show up, whether they tell me 
about it or not. The TBII is fanat- 
ically secretive and they don’t 
really give a hang about interstel- 
lar law. I suspect they’ll send 



somebody along and it could be 
anybody. You know that person- 
ality overlay technique — ” 

“The zombie business?” Cro- 
well echoed Dr. Norman’s words. 

“Exactly. They can make a xero- 
copy of anybody. Anybody they 
can kidnap and hold for a month, 
anyhow.” He drained the last of 
his wine. “This puts a distin- 
guished, shall we say ’well-ex- 
posed’ person, such as yourself, 
above suspicion, of course. Too 
many people would notice your 
absence.” 

His eyes told Otto again. He's 
lying, he suspects. 

The ambassador levered himself 
out of the oversized cushion. 
“Here, let me freshen your drink.” 
He came back with two full glasses. 

“Thanks. Oops, time to take my 
Pandroxin.” He took a pillbox 
from his pocket and washed down 
two pills, one Gravitol and one al- 
cohol suppressant. 

“Ah, weak stuff, that. You must 
have a time here. Won’t they let 
you take Gravitol?” 

“No — 1 asked for it, naturally. 
But they say I’m too old and too 
fat.” How dangerous is this subtle 
drunkard? “You have any theory 
about Malatesta?” 

Fitz-Jones shrugged and re- 
peated the sloshing gesture. “1 
really don’t know. I’m sure of one 
thing, though. This nonsense 
about the creatures being respon- 
sible is just that, a bunch of snu- 
urgsh — pardon — hog wash.” 



TOFITTHECRIME

“I agree. They simply aren’t ca- 
pable of violence.” 

“Not only that. Malatesta was a 
great favorite of theirs. He even 
learned quite a bit of the language. 
They adopted..him into one of the 
families, an honorary Bruuchian." 
“I didn’t know that.” 

“Oh, yes. He went to a lot of 
their gel-togethers. That priestly 
council made him an advisor of 
some sort.” 

“Yes,” Crowell mused. “I heard 
today that he had been present at 
one of their stillness rituals.” 
“Where they embalm the poor 
creatures? Well, / didn’t know that. 
Wonder why he didn’t tell any- 
body about it. Struckheimer 
would’ve been his friend for life.” 
“Well, as you say, the Bruuch- 
ians couldn’t have done away with 
Malatesta; so it must have been 
either an accident or murder. I 
guess the agents investigated both 
possibilities.” 

“Presumably. They seem to 
spend most of their time dredging 
dustpits. Supposedly taking sam- 
ples, actually looking for a body, 
1 guess. 1 suppose the prime mur- 
der suspect would be Kindle, the 
new supervisor. But he never 
wanted the job — it’s twice as much 
work for only a pittance more pay. 
Besides, he’s worried that what- 
ever happened to Malatesta could 
happen to him, too.” 

“You know him well, then?” 
Watch it, don’t get too inquisi- 
tive. 



“Oh, quite well. He was in the 
Civil Service when I was posted on 
Lamarr’s World. He had a con- 
siderable block of stock in the 
Company and when the assistant 
supervisor’s position became 
open he came out here and took the 
job. 1 was transferred here about 
a year later and we just picked up 
where we had left off.” 

Time to change the subject. “La- 
marr’s World. I’ve heard of it, of 
course, but I’ve never been there.” 
“It was a lovely world.” Fitz- 
Jones started the sloshing gesture 
but checked himself. “Especially 
compared to this desolation.” 

They talked of this and other 
harmless topics for about an hour, 
Crowell stifled a yawn. “I really 
must be going. Excuse me for be- 
ing a poor guest, but I tire so easily 
in this gravity.” 

“Oh, excuse me for being an in- 
considerate host. 1 can be quite a 
bore, I know.” Fitz-Jones helped 
Crowell up. “I’m afraid you may 
have trouble getting a taxi — ” 

“No, no problem. I can walk the 
few blocks.” They exchanged 
amenities and Crowell lurched 
away convincingly. 

H IS room had been searched by 
an amateur; Fitz-Jones’ assist- 
ant, probably. He hadn’t caught 
the hairs pasted over the closet 
door and suitcase lid — or even the 
pencil propped against the front 
door. Crowell sighed. Otto was 
worthy of more. 



34 



GALAXY 




Anyhow, there was nothing in- 
criminating in the billet itself. 
Crowell went into the outhouse 
and latched the door. He took out a 
penstick and removed the cap. 
Doing so caused the pen to emit an 
invisible beam of ultraviolet 
light. Crowell shook a contact 
lens out of the cap and placed it in- 
to his left eye. With it, he could see 
quite well, though the place would 
still be pitch-black to light ampli- 
fiers or infrared eye clusters. 

The hair across the loosened 
board was still in place. He lifted 
the board and removed the case 
that used to be his suitcase’s false 
bottom. He took a few items from 
it, replaced it and smoothed the 
hair down in the position he had 
memorized. 

The street lights went off at mid- 
night. Crowell donned the night- 
glasses he had bought at the Com- 
pany store and walked the kilo- 
meter to the main warehouse with- 
out meeting anyone. 

Knowing that any guard would 
also be equipped with nightglasses, 
Crowell approached the building 
on a parallel street a block away 
and sat quietly behind the edge of a 
building for a half hour, watching 
the entrance. 

Satisfied that the warehouse was 
unguarded, Crowell crossed to the 
entrance and studied the lock. It 
was a simple magnetically coded 
padlock and he opened it in a 
couple of minutes with a desen- 
sitizer and a set of picks. 



His closing of the door behind 
him dropped the light level below 
the nightglasses’ threshold and 
Crowell had to use his ultraviolet 
penstick to see. The tool was de- 
signed for close work, but he could 
get around with it. Directed at his 
feet it made a bright spot sur- 
rounded by a vague circle about a 
meter in diameter. He was unable 
to get an overall view of the ware- 
house, though — merely a dim im- 
pression of crates stacked around. 

He wasn’t looking for anything 
specific and really didn’t have any 
great expectations. This was just 
another part of the routine, like go- 
ing through the mines. He wished it 
had been possible to get around 
there without a guide, when the 
mines were empty. 

Crowell walked around for an 
hour or so, examining every useless 
detail. At the other end of the 
warehouse he came to an open 
door. He doubted he would find 
anything worth his effort, but he 
went in to check. 

A wide trough along one wall 
proved to be filled with a mixture 
of sand and sawdust, probably 
from the native ironwood. The 
opposite wall was stacked high 
with plastic bags filled with the 
same substance. At the end of the 
room stood a sink and a couple of 
large buckets. A shelf above the 
sink held several cans the size of 
half-liter paint cans. Evidently 
this was the place they prepared 
the substance that kept the na- 



TO FITTHE CRIME 



35 




lives from slipping on the ivet 
mine floors. 

hfe inspected the sink and it was 
just a dirty sink. The cans above 
had been inexpertly lettered, “An- 
tiseptic.” He picked up one and 
shook it; it was about three- 
quarters full of some powder. On 
the top he found a faint legend: 
BISMUTH NITRATE CRYS- 
TALS C. P. 1 KG. 

Crowell almost dropped the can 
in surprise. Evidently the original 
label had been eradicated, but a 
trace of it remained visible in ul- 
traviolet. He replaced the can and 
sat back against the sink. The crys- 
tals could account for the native's 
shortened life span and for the 
frantic activity in the mine; bis- 
muth was a powerful stimulant 
and euphoric for them, as well as a 
cumulative poison. 

They must absorb it through 
their feet as they work . 

Now who would be responsible? 
Workers who mixed the bismuth 
nitrate into the sand-sawdust mix- 
ture probably didn’t know what 
was going on — or the cans might as 
well have been left unaltered. Had 
the labels been erased before the 
cans were shipped in? 

That would seem likely, since ev- 
erybody seems to know about the 
bismuth theory. Better have a talk 
with Jonathan Lyndham, new 
Chief of Incoming (Supplies) . 

T he night outside was as dark as 
it had been when Crowell had 



first broken into the warehouse. He 
snapped the padlock and grate- 
fully stripped the thin plastic gloves 
off his hands. 

An almost inaudible click came 
from behind him and to his left. 
The Crowell-mind reacted even be- 
fore the Otto-mind could think 
“safety switch.” Crowell dove for 
a ditch on the side of the road. He 
was blinded as his nightglasses fell 
off, but a bright red pencil of light 
fanning the road at waist level pro- 
vided its own illumination before 
it flickered out. By then he had slid 
a miniature airpistol out of a 
pocket holster. He aimed at where 
the fading retinal afterimage 
showed the scarlet dot of a laser 
muzzle — he squeezed off four si- 
lent shots in rapid succession. He 
heard at least three of them rico- 
chet from the warehouse wall, 
then the shuffle of a man running 
away. 

He lost precious seconds finding 
the nightglasses, took another sec- 
ond to sort out the images and see 
the man running, nearly a block 
away. Extreme range for this little 
pop-gun — Crowell aimed high, 
fired and missed, fired and mis- 
sed. On his third try the man stum- 
bled to the ground, staggered back 
to his feet and continued running, 
holding his arm. If he still had the 
laser pistol he didn’t seem dis- 
posed to use it. Good thing, Otto 
thought. I f the man had been a pro- 
fessional he would have figured 
out how lightly armed Crowell 



36 



GALAXY 




was and would have flattened 
down at that extreme range to give 
Crowell a leisurely roasting. 

He studied the rapidly dwin- 
dling figure. Nobody he recog- 
nized. Not fat or thin or tall or 
short. Crowell had to admit that 
he probably wouldn’t know the 
man the next time he saw him. 
Unless the assailant had that arm 
in a sling or cast— which wasn’t 
unlikely. 

T he radiophone started buzzing 
as soon as Crowell stepped into 
his billet. He picked up the hand- 
set. 

“Crowell speaking." 

“Issac? Where have you been at 
this hour? This is Waldo - I’ve 
been trying to get you since three." 

“Oh, I woke up and couldn’t get 
back to sleep so 1 took a little 
walk to tire myself out.” 

“Well, T look, pardon me for 
calling so late, but that sample you 
gave me— some of the cells in it are 
still alive!” 

“Still alive? From a two-hun- 
dred-year-old mummy?” 

“And undergoing mitosis. You 
know what mitosis is?” 

“Cells dividing, yeah — ” 

“My finding out was just a coin- 
cidence — I had the incubator stage 
on the microscope, that helped. I’d 
just put the sample in there rather 
than go through the rigamarole of 
changing to a regular stage. There 
was an interesting cell, a big nerve 
cell, that had evidently died in the 



middle of the anaphase — of 
mitosis, that is. I looked at it for a 
minute and then went off to get a 
beer, got sidetracked by some 
maintenance I had to do on the 
spectrometer anyhow, I got 
back to the microscope a couple 
of hours later and that same nerve 
cell was in a different part of the 
anaphase! Those cells are grow- 
ing and dividing, but at a rate that 
must be several hundred times 
slower than normal Bruuchian 
cells.” 

“That’s incredible!” 

“It’s more than incredible -it’s 
impossible. I don’t know, Isaac. 
I’m a generalist, just an overedu- 
cated veterinarian. We need a 
couple of real biologists and 
we’ll have them, too, dozens of 
them, as soon as the word gets out. 
Suspended animation, that’s 
what it adds up to. Why, I wouldn’t 
be surprised if those Bruuchians 
had a hundred people studying 
them a year from now.” 

“You’re probably right.” For 
the first time, Crowell wondered 
whether somebody else might be 
listening in. 

Somebody was. 

V 

WnUAD you could make it, 
^Isaac.” Dr. Norman’s hand- 
shake was unusually firm. 

“Couldn’t pass up a chance to 
beat you again after all these years, 
Willy.”

“Ha — believe I was four wins 
ahead when you left. Match you 
for white.” 

“No, Willy, you go first. Out of 
consideration for your youth and 
inexperience." 

The doctor laughed. “Pawn to 
King-four and I'll fix you a 
drink.” 

Crowell sat down at the chess- 
board and made Willy’s first move 
for him. He looked at the pieces for 
a second and started his defense. 
“Talked to Waldo today?” 

“Oh, yes -the mummy thing. 
Quite fantastic. He was most se- 
cretive as to how he came upon a 
sample, though. I can just see Wal- 
do skulking into one of those huts 
with his dissecting kit.” Dr. Nor- 
man set a drink down beside Cro- 
well and took the chair opposite 
him. “1 don’t suppose you had 
anything to do with it, Isaac?” 

“Well,” Crowell said cautious- 
ly, “I’m pretty sure how he got the 
sample. But, as you say, it’s a deep 
dark secret right now.” 

“This world is full of secrets.” 
The doctor made his second move. 

Crowell responded promptly. 

“A Philidor defense, Isaac? 
You’re getting conservative in 
your old age. You used to be quite 
unpredictable.” 

“And you used to be four wins 
ahead.” 

The game went on for about an 
hour, with neither man saying 
much. Isaac was ahead in both 
position and strength when Dr. 



Norman looked up and asked, 
“Who are you?” 

“What did you say, Willy?” 

The doctor took a piece of pa- 
per out of his pocket, unfolded it 
and tossed it in the middle of the 
board. “If you were Isaac Cro- 
well, you’d be dying or dead, on 
Gravitol. And don’t tell me you 
aren’t on it — Pandroxin gives a 
yellowish cast to the skin. You 
don’t have it. Besides, your chess 
style is wrong; good, but all wrong. 
Isaac never knew how to play 
position.” 

Crowell finished off his drink, 
mostly melted ice, and leaned back 
in the chair. He stuck his right 
hand in his pocket and aimed the 
pistol under the table at the doc- 
tor’s abdomen. 

“My name is Otto McGavin. 
I’m an agent for the TBII. But 
please continue to call me 
Isaac I’m more Crowell than 
McGavin in this persona.” 

The doctor nodded. “And you’ve 
done a very good job. Much more 
convincing than those other 
two — that is why you came here, 
isn’t it, to investigate their disap- 
pearance?” 

“Investigate their deaths. Every 
agent has a monitor implanted in 
his heart — they stopped broad- 
casting.” 

“Well, needless to say, your se- 
cret's safe with me.” 

“You shouldn’t be burdened 
with it too much longer. 1 expect to 
have things out in the open within a 



38 



GALAXY 




day or two. Down to business 
now — ” Crowell moved a knight 
and said, “Mate in three.” 

“Yes, I saw that coming.” Wil- 
ly smiled. “I was hoping to dis- 
tract you.” 

“Doctor, I think you missed 
your calling.” Otto relaxed a little. 
“By the way, have you treated any 
gunshot wounds lately?” 

“What — why?” 

“Somebody tried to ambush me 
last night. I shot him.” 

“Well, 1 did treat a gunshot 
wound this morning — but it 
couldn’t have been your fellow.” 

C ROWELL took out his pistol, 
opened the magazine and let one 
of the small pellets roll onto the 
chessboard. “A wound in the right 
arm, this size projectile.” 

Dr. Norman rolled the pellet be- 
tween his thumb and forefinger. 
“Yes, it was this small. The very 
devil to get out, too. And the 
wound was in the right arm.” He 
took a deep breath. “Early this 
morning Ambassador Fitz-Jones 
and Superintendant Kindle woke 
me up to take a pellet out of 
Kindle's arm. They said they had 
been up drinking and decided to 
try some target practice in the 
ambassador's back yard. Fitz- 
Jones had accidentally shot 
Kindle; he was most apologetic. 
They both reeked of wine, but 
acted quite sober. Kindle was in 
some pain; it looked as if they had 
tried to get the pellet out them- 



selves. But it was too deep.” 
“Kindle — I’ve never met him.” 
“It seems you did meet him, last 
night. It’s hard to believe. He 
seems such a meek fellow.” 

“You might as well know the 
whole story. If anything happens to 
me, try to get word to Confeder- 
ation authorities. Some group of 
persons, including but not neces- 
sarily limited to the ambassador 
and the superintendant, is sys- 
tematically poisoning the Bru- 
uchians who work in the mines. 
The only motivation 1 can see is 
that it makes them work 
harder — increases profits. Say, 
Kindle owns a large part of the 
Company, doesn’t he? 1 wonder 
whether Fitz-Jones also has an in- 
terest.” 

“I don’t know,” Dr. Norman 
said. “He claims to be indepen- 
dently wealthly. I can see that he 
might well be investing in the com- 
pany, though. Profits have quad- 
rupled in the past few years. Why, 
I’ve been thinking of investing, 
myself.” 

“Maybe you better not. Profits 
will be going down pretty soon.” 

“1 suppose. Well, it is a horrible 
thing, even though 1 don’t much 
care for the little boogers myself. 
What can I do to help?” 

“Well, I’ve got to get to a sub- 
space radio. The only two on the 
planet are the superintendant’s and 
the ambassador’s. If you can get 
one of them here for an hour or so. 
I’ll be able to call in the arrest and 



TO FITTHE CRIME 



39 




get authority to confine them.” 
‘That’ll be easy enough. Fitz- 
Jones and I have to fill out an ac- 
cident report and take it to the 
Company clerk for witnessing. I 
told him to come by around three 
this afternoon; it’ll take more than 
an hour.” 

“You couldn’t get Kindle to 
come up, too, could you?” 

“Afraid not. I’ve already con- 
fined him to quarters — wouldn’t do 
to erode my authority in these mat- 
ters by telling him to come over for 
a chat. But you’re in no danger 
from him. I had to make a deep in- 
cision in his right triceps. He’s go- 
ing to be either doped up or in con- 
siderable pain for at least a week.” 
“Can’t say that 1 have too much 
sympathy for him. Well, then. I’ll 
pay a visit to the ambassadorial 
residence about three o’clock. 
Here, take this.” Crowell handed 
the pistol to Dr. Norman. “I’m 
afraid I’ve set you up as a 
secondary target.” 

Dr. Norman turned the little 
weapon over on his palm. “Won’t 
you be needing this thing more 
than 1?” 

“No, I’m going to pick up some 
heavier artillery. Kindle had a laser 
pistol last night — if he’d known 
what he was doing, he could have 
fried me with no trouble.” 

“Well, I’ll certainly keep it. But 
I’ve never fired a gun in my life.” 
“Well, be careful — that pistol 
doesn’t have a safety. Just aim it in 
the right general direction and start 



pulling the trigger — it has over a 
hundred shots left in the maga- 
zine.” 

Dr. Norman dropped the weap- 
on into the capacious front pocket 
of his lab coat. “1 hope you get 
them safely incarcerated before 1 
have to use it.” 

“They should be in the Com- 
pany jail before dark tonight.” 

F rom his billet window Crowell 
could see the ambassador roll 
away toward the dispensary. He 
unplugged the laser pistol and 
checked the charge on it — it was 
more than half-full, two minutes of 
continuous operation, which 
would be about enough to take on a 
platoon of infantrymen. He held 
both the pistol and his burglar’s kit 
in his right hand and draped a light 
jacket over them. 

He set out on foot down the 
street away from the ambassador’s 
house, then circled around and 
came up behind the place. There 
were no buildings to obscure Fitz- 
Jones’ view of the desert, which 
rolled in from the horizon to with- 
in a few meters of a large picture 
window. 

Crowell took a crayon from his 
kit and inscribed a large black cir- 
cle on the window. The black turn- 
ed to chalky white and the circle of 
plastic fell out. With considerable 
effort he pulled himself up to the 
hole and through. He swallowed a 
Gravitol only one more was left 
in his pillbox — and reflected on 



40

how good it was going to be to get 
his real body back again. 

He checked three rooms before 
he found the radio in the study. 
There was a cover over the sending 
plate and he cursed aloud when he 
saw that it had a thumbprint lock. 
He would need hours to open it. 

Nothing for it but to wait until 
Fitz-Jones returned and force him 
to open it. Crowell had an un- 
characteristically macabre thought 
as he felt the weight of the vibro- 
knife in his pocket. He only needed 
the man's thumb. 

Might as well enjoy the wait. 
Crowell walked over the thick car- 
pet to the kitchen. He found a 
glass, stuck the laser into his belt 
and tapped the cask of wine. 

“Don't do anything foolish, 
Isaac." 

Crowell turned slowly. His per- 
ceptions registered rapidly, with- 
out punctuation: Mark II Westing- 
house antique laser safety off right- 
hand range three meters set on full 
dispersion no chance . 

“Why Jonathan. Fancy meeting 
you here." 

Hand shaking but full disper- 
sion can’t miss hasn’t fired yet 
probably won’t thinkthinkthink . 

“I’m surprised at you, Isaac. 
Such language you used a minute 
ago. But you aren’t really Isaac, 
are you? Any more than those 
other two were geologists. You’ll 
be joining your friends tonight, Isa- 
ac. You can talk over old times, 
out in the dustpit.” 



“Shut up.” Another man came 
into view, his right arm stiff in a 
tractor cast. Kindle. “Give me 
that gun.” Kindle took it into his 
left hand. Crowell noted that he 
was trembling even more than Jon- 
athan, but from pain and prob- 
ably anger, rather than nervous- 
ness. “Now go disarm him." 

Kill him use body as shield 
would work one gee Otto-body but 
Crowell-body too slow too big . 

Jonathan plucked the gun from 
Crowell’s belt and hopped back. 
“You aren’t as dangerous as Stuart 
said you would be.” 

“He’s dangerous, all right. But 
we’ve pulled his fangs. Go on back 
to your office, Lyndham. Fitz and 
I’ll finish this job; you’re the only 
one without any good reason for 
being here.” 

Jonathan left by the front door. 

“Well, Mr. McGavin — I sup- 
pose you find this rather embaras- 
sing, to be held at bay by a meek 
fellow like me. 

“Yes, we heard your whole con- 
versation this morning — Dr. Nor- 
man’s radiophone really doesn’t 
work too well, neither does Dr. 
Struckheimer’s; they broadcast all 
the time, straight into a recorder 
in my office.” He motioned with 
the gun. “Come sit in the living 
room, Mr. McGavin. By all means 
bring your wine. I’d love to join 
you, but my good hand is 
full — disappointment should 
make it even easier to kill you when 
the time comes.”

C ROWELL sat in the old-fash- 
ioned chair and wondered when 
the time would come. “You can’t 
actually think you can keep get- 
ting away with this.” 

“It’s a big dustpit, the biggest. 
I’m afraid Drs. Norman and 
Struckheimer will be following 
you into it, too. We can’t afford to 
have dozens of specialists prying 
around.” 

Crowell shook his head. “If I 
don’t report, you’re going to have 
to contend with more than a hand- 
ful of scientists. A battle cruiser 
will land in your port and put the 
whole damn planet under arrest.” 
“Strange they didn’t do it when 
the first two agents disappeared. 
That’s a pretty clumsy bluff, Mc- 
Gavin.” 

“Those two good men were 
agents, Mr. Kindle, but just agents. 
I’m a prime operator, one of twelve 
such. You can ask Fitz-Jones what 
that means when he gets back.” 
“You may not be alive when he 
gets back. He didn’t want to kill 
you here, because to do so would 
entail dragging your body over 
nearly a kilometer of desert. But 
it occurs to me that we could make 
more than one trip.” 

“A grisly alternative. Do you ac- 
tually think you could cut up a man 
as if he were a side of beef? Very 
messy.” 

“I’m a desperate — ” 

“Whatever are you two talking 
about?” Fitz-Jones came in 
through the hall entrance. “I saw 



Jonathan on the way here. I 
thought he was supposed to wait 
with you until I got back.” 

“1 was afraid he’d do something 
stupid, so I told him to go. Never 
did feel I could trust the man very 
much.” 

“You may be right. But I didn’t 
want to leave you alone with this 
expert murderer.” 

“Hasn’t murdered me yet. Fitz, 
he says he’s a prime operator — 
does that mean anything to you?” 
Fitz-Jones’ eyebrows went up a 
fraction and he looked at Crowell. 
“That can’t possibly be true. This 
planet’s too small to rate a prime 
operator.” 

“We always send a prime when 
an agent gets killed,” Crowell said. 
“No matter how unimportant the 
case is otherwise.” 

“Possibly,” Fitz-Jones mused, 
“and if so, 1 am indeed honored.” 
He gave a mocking little bow. “But 
the most expert bridge player 
would lose if he couldn’t pick up his 
cards. That’s the position you’re in, 
sir.” 

“Do you know what will happen 
if you murder me. Ambassador?” 
“No ‘if.’ After we murder you. 
Will they send another prime op- 
erator? They’ll soon run out.” 
“They’ll quarantine this whole 
planet and ferret you out. You 
haven’t got a chance.” 

“On the contrary, we have a very 
good chance — the chance that 
you’re lying. Which is rather large 
odds, considering your circum- 



42 



GALAXY 




stances. I don’t think ill of you for 
it, Mr. McGavin. I would do the 
same in your position.” 

“Why don’t you stop gloating at 
him and get some rope. My arm’s 
tired.” 

“Excellent idea.” Fitz-Jones 
went outside and returned with a 
long coil. 

“Finish your wine, Isaac. Come 
over here beside him. Kindle. If he 
tries anything I don’t want you to 
roast me along with him.” 

Crowell expanded his chest and 
his biceps as Fitz-Jones wound the 
rope around him. An old trick 
and not very subtle, but Fitz-Jones 
didn’t notice. The way he tied him 
up, just winding the rope around 
and around his body, reminded Ot- 
to that he was dealing with inex- 
perienced amateurs and he chas- 
tised himself again for being so 
careless. Why, they hadn’t even 
searched him; though he had to 
admit that he had nothing more 
lethal than a penknife stashed 
away. And his limbs were free. 

“We have several hours’ wait, 
Mr. McGavin. I suggest you try to 
sleep.” Fitz-Jones went into the 
kitchen and came out with Cro- 
well’s laser and a soda bottle. He 
walked over to Crowell and chop- 
ped down with the hard plastic bot- 
tle. Crowell tried to dodge but it hit 
the side of his head and the room 
went all blue sparks and gelatin 
and faded away. 



VI 



H e had been awake, listening, 
for at least an hour when Fitz- 
Jones came over with a glass of 
water and poured it on his head. 

“Wake up, Mr. McGavin. It’s 
midnight. The lights are out and 
we’re going for a little stroll.” Cro- 
well staggered to his feet, careful to 
puff out his chest and flex his 
muscles so the bonds appeared 
taut. 

Kindle said, “I just thought of 
something, Fitz. Do you have an 
extra pair of nightglasses?” 

“What? You didn’t bring 
yours?” 

“I’m not in the habit of carrying 
them around in broad daylight.” 
“Well, then. I’ll just take care of 
him alone. We aren’t going to take 
a light.” 

“Oh, no. After what he did to me 
/ want the pleasure of roasting 
him — slowly.” 

“Sure, and stumble into a dust- 
pit along the way. I’m not letting 
you use the glasses and go out with 
him alone. You couldn’t hit the 
ground with a rock, not even right- 
handed.” 

“Fitz, he’s unarmed and tied up. 
And he can’t see in the dark.” 
“Unarmed and tied up and 
blind, he’s more dangerous than 
you would be in command of a 
battle cruiser. That’s the end of the 
discussion.” 

“All right, all right. Just let me 



TO FITTHE CRIME 



43 




come along to finish him off. I can 
hang onto your belt." 

Fitz-Jones glanced at Crowell, 
who was smiling in spite of his pre- 
dicament. “The arrangement had a 
certain lack of dignity. I can see it 
amuses our friend. But all right. 
You can walk along behind 
me- but if he tries anything let me 
handle it." 

“Sure, Fitz." Kindle ostenta- 
tiously switched the laser to safe- 
ty. “Even if he starts throwing fis- 
sion bombs, 1 won't fire until we 
get there. Then let me get in front 
of you and find him by laserlight." 

“Let's get on with it, then. Mr. 
McGavin, it will be your honor to 
lead us. I'll direct you." 

They went out by the kitchen 
door into the absolute blackness of 
the night. 

Otto knew he had half a kilo- 
meter in which to make his move. 
He figured that his captors would 
be least alert about halfway there. 
He counted carefully measured 
steps, twelve hundred to a kilo- 
meter. 

The men were silent except for 
occasional terse directions from 
Fitz-Jones. Otto counted three 
hundred steps, then moved slightly 
to his left. Under the rope, he 
raised his left hand to his right 
shoulder and his left arm popped 
out of the coil. His body shielded 
the action from Fitz-Jones. He had 
a Firm mental picture of the man 
behind him and could now strike at 
any vital spot once he knew where 



any part of his body was. 

He stopped and Fitz-Jones prod- 
ded him with the laser, giving him a 
reference point. He brought his left 
hand around in a shallow chop that 
sent the laser .spinning. Before it 
hit the ground he delivered a sav- 
age, killing kick to the groin, with 
enough force to knock both men 
down. 

He heard the laser skitter away 
and ran after it as the two men fell. 
But on the third step he skidded on 
loose gravel, lost his balance and, 
falling, went into a shoulder roll. 
But his shoulder never hit the 
ground. 

He hit the dustpil with a faint 
pop and was floating through a 
nightmare of viscous powder. He 
fought to hold his breath as the 
dust crawled into his nostrils. 
Then his knees bumped against the 
rock floor of the pit. Fighting 
panic, he stood and pushed his free 
arm straight up. He couldn't tell 
whether his hand cleared the 
surface of the pit. Lungs burning, 
he tried to walk back the way he 
had fallen, then realized that his 
sense of direction had vanished. 
He tried to walk in a straight line, 
any direction was all right, the pit 
couldn't be more than a few meters 
in diameter, if it were bigger they 
would use it for their dumping 
place but it was impossible to walk 
and he drifted to his knees and 
crawled slowly until his head 
pressed against the stony wall of 
the pit and he dragged himself

pull the heavy Crowell-body up.

Crowell put his chin on the edge 
of the pit, exhaled in a quick hiss 
and sucked in air, started to sneeze 
and bit his tongue hard. Kindle was 
screaming. 

“I can’t see\ You broke them, 
dammit!" Fitz-Jones was moan- 
ing, making little-animal whimper- 
ing sounds. Suddenly the red glare 
of a laser flooded the scene. Kindle 
was fanning it around, using it as a 
searchlight. That was stupid; if 
anyone was awake back at the 
Company, they'd see it. Not likely 
they would come out and 
investigate, though. 

Fitz-Jones, who shouldn’t even 
have been alive, was actually stand- 
ing, staggering, doubled over with 
pain. The edge of the beam ca- 
ressed him and one leg burst into 
flame. He whirled around twice 
and disappeared. Another dustpit. 

The light flickered off. “Mc- 
Gavin? I hope you saw that. You’re 
hiding out there somewhere, I 
know it. But I can wait, I can 
wait— when it gets light, you’re a 
dead man!” 

M cGAVIN cautiously pulled 
himself out of the dustpit. He 
unwound the rope that was still 
wrapped loosely around his body. 



After investigating the ground 
around the pit by touch, he had to 
admit that the laser must have fal- 
len in. He wasn’t going after it. 

There was a large outcropping of 
rock about thirty meters away; he 
had seen it by laser-light. Slowly, 
silently he crawled in that di- 
rection, groping in front of him, 
patting the ground with his palm. 
Several times his hand found the 
warm talcum-powder softness of a 
dustpit he detoured around it. 
Finally he got to the outcropping 
and sat behind a large boulder. 

He took stock. One vibroknife, 
two hands, two feet and lots of 
rocks. One coil of rope. He had the 
alternatives of garroting Kindle, 
cutting him to pieces, or simply 
breaking every bone in his body. 
All methods effective against an 
unarmed man. But suicide against 
a laser. 

He was tired, more tired than he 
could remember having been in all 
of his strenuous life. He rattled the 
pillbox softly. One Gravitol left. 

Have to save it, take it just be- 
fore dawn . 

He formulated and discarded 
half a dozen plans. Might as well 
have just taken a deep breath in the 
dustpit. So tired. 

Footsteps — Kindle wouldn’t be 
insane enough to walk up in the 
dark. No, the steps were confident; 
it was a Bruuchian. He walked 
right up to Crowell and sat down, 
not a meter away. Crowell could 
hear his breathing.

Crowell whispered in the infor- 
mal mode. “Do I know you / 
friend who comes in the night?" 

The Bruuchian also whispered. 
“Crowell-who-jests / I am Pornu- 
uran / of the family Tuurlg / you 
do not kno'A' me / though I know 
you / you are a friend of my broth- 
er / Kindle-who-leads.” 

“Kindle-who-leads / is in your 
family?" 

“Yes / the priests gave the fam- 
ily Tuurlg / the honor-tradition of 
adopting / the highest humans / 
Kindle-who leads and / before 
him / Malatesta-the-highest." 

“Brother-of-my-friend Pornu- 
uran / could you lead me / from 
this place / before the desert is 
light?” 

The Bruuchian laughed, an al- 
most silent belch. “Crowell-who- 
jests / you are indeed the merriest 
human / my brothers and I / 
came to observe / the human 
stillness ritual / of course we 
cannot interfere. The priests / saw 
the red light in the desert / and sent 
us here for instruction / perhaps 
to help / carry the still one." 

“Where are your other broth- 
ers?” 

“Crowell-who-jests / my oldest 
and youngest brothers / stand near 
their brother / Kindle-who-leads / 
he also asked us to / lead him in 
darkness / to lead him to you / 
but we would not disobey / the 
priests’ order.” 

Thank God for that, Crowell 
thought. He briefly considered us- 



ing the native as a shield, but that 
would be pretty low. And ineffec- 
tive; the native was too small. 

With a start Crowell realized 
that he could see a vague outline of 
the native silhouetted against the 
lighter rock. He took out the 
pillbox and swallowed his last 
Gravitol. Instantly the tiredness 
washed away. 

He peered over the side of the 
boulder. He couldn't yet see 
Kindle, but it would only be a 
matter of minutes; dawn came 
swiftly here. Then Kindle could 
walk up at his leisure. 

Suddenly Crowell had a plan. It 
was outrageously simple, and rath- 
er risky. But it might work — and 
he had little choice. 

H e gathered an armload of 
rocks and set out across the 
plain, moving as quickly as he 
could with safety. By the time his 
hand found a dustpit there was 
enough light for him to see it 
disappear into the powder. He felt 
around and determined where the 
edge of the pit was, then set down 
the rocks and vibroknife and 
lowered himself into the warm 
pool, fighting the urge to scramble 
out immediately. 

He arranged the rocks around 
the flat edge in such a way that his 
head would be hidden from view 
when he was immersed up to his 
chin. 

The blade of the knife only slid 
out halfway when he touched the 



46 



GALAXY 




button on the side. He checked 
with his fingernail and it wasn’t vi- 
brating. The dust must have 
fouled the mechanism. Well, it 
still had a point and an edge. 

He could hear Kindle moving, 
about twenty meters away, he esti- 
mated. Still couldn't see the man, 
but he chucked a rock in his di- 
rection. 

The laser glared in answer. It 
washed the boulder he had been us- 
ing as a shield; he could hear the 
rock crackle and smelled a sharp 
tang of ozone and nitrogen dioxide. 

“Getting warm back there, Mc- 
Gavin? I know where you are — I 
heard my little friend go up there. 
Might as well just step out and save 
yourself the wait.” He gave the 
rock another short turn. 

Now Crowell could just make 
out Kindle. Three Bruuchians were 
walking with him. He was step- 
ping very cautiously, watching the 
ground. Crowell immersed him- 
self up to his nose. 

“This is it, McGavin. Now 
you’re a dead man.” Crowell 
looked over the edge, and saw 
Kindle’s back, some five meters 
away. If the knife were working, he 
could throw it for an easy kill. But 
two inches of' plain steel required 
closer action. 

He picked up the knife and 
quietly pulled himself out of the 
pit. He ran softly toward Kindle, 
who was shouting at the rock, laser 
at eye level. Almost too easy. 

Then one of the Bruuchians 



jerked his head around, seeing 
Crowell. Kindle caught the 
movement and turned. Otto dove 
for a knee-high tackle. The beam 
brushed Crowell and his shoulder 
and half his face burst into flame, 
snuffed out immediately as be 
piled into Kindle and both men 
went down heavily. Crowell pinned 
Kindle’s gun arm to the ground and 
the ravening beam spent itself 
uselessly on the big rock, while 
Crowell plunged the knife again 
and again into Kindle’s back; even 
in a white fury of pain and hate he 
was instinctively going for the vul- 
nerable kidneys. The shock reac- 
tivated the knife; the rest of the 
blade hummed out and then it slip- 
ped with equal fluidity through 
flesh and bone and organs. Kindle 
arched his back and was still. 

Crowell rose to his knees and 
saw that Kindle still held the laser 
in a spastic grip, doing a fair job of 
melting the rock. He couldn’t pry 
the pistol from Kindle’s first and he 
stopped trying as wave after wave 
of intense pain throbbed through 
his body. 

He remembered his training. 
Still crouched over Kindle’s body, 
he closed his eyes and repeated 
over and over the mnemonic that, 
from his hypnotraining, isolated 
the pain and squeezed it into a 
smaller and smaller space. When 
it was a tiny pinprick as hot as the 
interior of a star, he pushed it just a 
millimeter outside his skin and 
held it there. Very carefully he sat 



TOFITTHE CRIME 



47 




down and slowly released for use 
those parts of his mind that weren’t 
occupied with keeping the pain 
outside. 

He touched his face with the 
back of his hand and when he with- 
drew it, long filaments of melted 
plastiflesK still clung to it. He 
noted that his other hand was still 
dripping with gore, with Kindle’s 
life, and he felt absolutely noth- 
ing, neither triumph nor remorse. 

The material of his shirt had va- 
porized and the plastiflesh over his 
shoulder had melted completely 
away. The real flesh ran from 
angry pink to deep blistered red to 
a black charred mass the size of 
his hand. A trickle of blood oozed 
from the well-done area and 
Crowell dispassionately de- 
cided the flow was not enough to 
justify bandaging the wound. 

The two younger Bruuchians 
came out from behind the rock and 
stood over Kindle. The older one 
limped out and rattled off some- 
thing in the informal mode, too fast 
for Crowell to translate. 

They picked up Kindle's stiff 
body and balanced it on their 
shoulders, to carry it away like a 
log. Suddenly it dawned on 
Crowell that Kindle wasn’t really 
dead; the oldest and youngest had 
passed him into stillness while his 
knife was doing its work. He 
looked at the rictus of pain on the 
man’s face and remembered 
Waldo’s evidence. 

The man was not dead, but he 



was dying. And he would die slowly 
for hundreds of years. Otto smiled. 

D r. NORMAN and two stretch- 
er-bearers picked their way 
across the desert and reached 
Crowell just before noon. Thirty 
years of medical practice had not 
prepared the doctor for the sight of 
a critically injured man sitting in 
front of a pool of dried and 
putrefying blood and gore, half his 
face a burned and running ruin 
and the other half smiling beauti- 
fically. 

Dear Dr. Crowell: 

Well, I finally got out of 
the hospital today — that 
plasti-flesh takes weeks to 
remove -and 1 have to ad- 
mit 1 much prefer being my- 
self again, to being you. 

Willy Norman sends his 
regards. Everybody I talked 
to, once they knew I wasn’t 
you, hoped that you might 
find the opportunity to visit 
there again soon. With this 
newjight on the stillness phe- 
nomenon, a thousandfold 
slowdown of biological pro- 
cesses, you can probably get 
somebody to put up the 
money for passage— maybe 
you can actually talk your 
publisher into putting out a 
revised Anomaly. 

Jonathan Lyndham, the 
only survivor of the “bis- 
muth conspiracy,” was con- 



48 



GALAXY 




victed last week of genas- 
ihenia (systematic weaken- 
ing of a race) and of being an 
accomplice to murder. He 
was sentenced to a complete 
personality wipe. 

Some of my colleagues 
think I'm an unregenerate 
barbarian, but I prefer the 
old-fashioned personality 
wipe — extinction — in cases 

like this. At least it has the 
virtue of being irreversible. 

As for the other members 
of the conspiracy, it was nev- 
er really clear whether they 
were being tried posthu- 
mously or just in absentia 
(except for the Ambassador 
Stuart Fitz-Jones, whose 
body hasn’t yet been found, 
but who definitely expired in 
a dustpit). Both Kindle and 
Malatesta were found in the 
Tuurlg “family room," hav- 
ing been passed into stillness 
some time before clinical 
death. As nearly as can be 
reconstructed from inter- 
viewing the natives, Mala- 
testa was consulting with a 
group of priests — they were 
paying him to keep salting 
the mines with bismuth — and 
suffered some sort of a sei- 
zure, perhaps a heart attack. 
The Tuurlg family’s oldest 
and youngest were, present 
and they did him the same 
service they would do for 
any other family member. 



I’m happy to report that 
Kindle was in the process of 
expiring even less pleasantly 
when the same thing hap- 
pened to him. 

It’s not yet clear, of 
course, what these two can 
perceive in their present 
state. I favor the theory that, 
since electrical impulses 
can’t be slowed, general rela- 
tivity and all that, they must 
still be feeling the same ma- 
laise they felt while expiring. 
Again, a barbaric sentiment, 
but I can’t say I feel any pity 
for them. 

Whenever I get out of the 
persona of a talented and/or 
educated person such as 
yourself, I feel an indefin- 
able loss, as if parts of my 
mind (which was actually 
your mind) have been mis- 
placed. I still retain a little 
Bruuchian, formal mode 
anyhow, and a vague outline 
of comparative anthropolo- 
gy; when 1 leaf through your 
book I often know what will 
be on the next page before I 
see it. 

It was a pleasure, as such 
things go. I look forward to 
meeting you again, the next 
time I get to Macrobastia. 
Maybe I can teach you how 
to play position in chess. 

Regards, 
Otto McGavin ★

two different things. Merrihew 
could do something about it. His 
record was most confidential but 
his batting average was high. In- 
credibly high. 

And you wouldn't have thought 
so to look at him. 

Dr. Poole had called Merrihew 
and they had met for lunch. When 
the waiter went away with his or- 
der Merrihew wanted to know the 
name of the trouble. 

“Lasvogel,” said Dr. Poole. 
“Look Merrihew, we have a 
chemistry section here — three, 
really, if you figure inorganic and 
bio and organic as separate, which 
they practically are. Then there's 
electron physics and computer de- 
sign and the mechanical section 
and the socio think-tank and some 
other stuff. And if Lasvogel want- 
ed to call himself section head of 
every one of them he’d have the 
right. Only it would look funny on 
the organization chart — and any- 
way he wouldn’t want it.” 

Merrihew said, “That's who he 
is, not your trouble." 

Dr. Poole wagged his big white 
head. “Oh, Lasvogel’s the trouble 



all right. He's coming apart." 

“Eggs in one basket," Merri- 
hew said. “All those departments 
with the head lopped off?" 

“All those departments could 
struggle along Just fine without 
him. Emphasis on struggle, may- 
be, but they'd make it. It's the 
West Ecuador thing. Actually I 
don’t mind if he cracks up after 
he's solved that one — he's earned 
a good breakdown. 1 Just want 
him to hang together until then." 

“What’s the West—” 

“Quiet.” The waiter came, put 
down drinks, went away. Dr. Poole 
was studious with ice cubes for a 
moment. He made a motion with 
his head that brought Merrihew 
leaning closer. 

“Code name. It isn't Ecuador 
and it isn’t West — and if you can 
do your work without knowing 
where it is, all the better. If Lasvo- 
gel can stay with it until he finds 
an answer you may never find out 
— and that’s all right." 

“How much longer does he 
need?" 

“I wish I knew. Oh, I wish I 
knew. It could be tonight, tomor- 
row. It could be weeks.” 

“Or never?” 

“Don’t say that." Dr. Poole 
made a terribly controlled ward- 
ing-off gesture. “Don’t even think 
it." 

“And there isn’t anyone else 
who might — " 

“No there isn't. Or maybe there 
is, but the only way to find him 



NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT

would be to describe the problem 
— and I can’t do that." 

“Better do it now, though." 

Dr. Poole gave him a long, 
sharp look. The waiter came with 
the salads., fussed about, went 
away again. “All right then,” said 
the director of the world’s quietest 
and most extraordinary consulting 
company. “Overpopulation. Ev- 
erything comes down to that. Too 
many people. Not just pollution 
but geopolitics — nations looking 
for room to expand. Businesses - 
they overbreed too -looking for 
markets. But the trouble is also 
too many kids in the classroom 
a solitary man looking for some 
place to walk where it’s wild and 
quiet. There are other problems 
besides overpopulation, but if we 
can whip that one we can whip 
them all." 

“Better hurry,” said Merrihew. 

“Yes, of course. Of course; 1 
know what you mean. It’s already 
too late for some things. A whole 
ocean could die if we controlled 
population by tomorrow night. 
But you see, that’s what we’ve 
done. What Lasvogel’s done.” 

“You lost me.” 

1\R. POOLE looked to right and 
^left and leaned close again. “The 
place we call West Ecuador has the 
highest birth rate in the hemi- 
sphere. Or almost,’’ he added. 
Maybe the hedging words were a 
scientist’s exactitude and maybe 
they were a little something to 



keep curiosity at bay. “We have 
ways of keeping day-to-day tabs 
on it, primitive as it is. Every 
doctor, every clinic in West 
Ecuador is feeding our com- 
puters, whether any one of them 
knows it or not. We can even get 
the midwives, about five-eighths of 
them — much more than half any- 
way. We’ve been setting the place 
up for an experiment for a long 
time. You don’t much approve of 
a tactic like that." 

“I didn’t say anything." 

“Most people wouldn’t ap- 
prove. High-handed, undigni- 
fied I’ve heard all the names for 
it. 1 also know all the preachments 
about means and ends. We’re 
doing what we’re doing because 
we haven’t been able to find an- 
other way — and because some- 
thing has to be done now and not 
when we can do a public-relations 
job and then put it through the 
courts. Little kids with blown-up 
bellies, toothpicks for arms and 
legs and sores all over — yes, we’re 
doing it for them. But also be- 
cause West Ecuador is a preview. 
The whole world is going to be like 
that — not might be, is going to 
be — if something isn’t done now." 

Merrihew put up both hands in a 
way that said. Well, all right, dam- 
mil. 

“We threw it to Lasvogel,” Dr. 
Poole said, “and he came 
through." He added a little anx- 
iously: “Lasvogel always comes 
through. Anyway, his treatment 



52 



GALAXY 




batted a thousand on a hundred 
and twenty-three cases. Injec- 
tions. Not one of the recipients got 
pregnant. No side effects. 1 know 
what you're going to say." Dr. 
I’oole added quickly, "Nothing 
new, eh? That Swedish pill, take it 
tonight, get your period to- 
morrow whether you've con- 
ceived or not? Wait there's 
more." 

Merrihew sat silent. 

“Lasvogel's whole approach was 
different," Dr. Poole continued, 
“and that's all I'll say about it 
except his preparation is more po- 
tent than you'd believe. More even 
than Lasvogel believed. We did a 
mass treatment. Well, I'll tell 
you: we had a prevailing wind sit- 
uation and we did it with a chem- 
ical fog. Lasvogel we we fig- 
ured it might affect some women 
in a nearby city to some measur- 
able extent. As 1 said, we've spent 
a lot of time and a lot of money 
setting up observation posts. We 
were looking for a decimal point 
and maybe three zeros before we 
came to a number — no more than 
that.” 

Dr. Poole sat and wagged his 
head. It looked for a while as if he 
had forgotten what he was saying, 
forgotten his lunch and his guest, 
forgotten even this tumbling 
urgency. Then he asked, “In five 
weeks, in a population pushing 
two million, know how many 
pregnancies we recorded in West 
Ixuador?” 



It was not Merrihew's style to 
respond to rhetorical questions. 
He simply waited. 

“Seventeen. Seventeen, in five 
weeks." 

“Wow." Merrihew cut steak, 
forked it up, lifted it, looked at it, 
put it down. “Wow." Pollution, 
belly bloat and toothpick legs, war 
and pestilence and cold greed is 
emperor; survival is greed. And 
then — how had Dr. Poole put it? 

a solitary man walking some 
place where it's wild and quiet. 
Merrihew had time to get a glimpse 
of a man like that in a place like 
that and think that it might after 
all be that way when Dr. Poole had 
to go and say, “They were all 
white." 



M errihew hadn't gotten to be 
what he was by being uncool 
and it could be that he looked the 
part. But once in his life a flash- 
bulb had gone off in his face in a 
dark room and once someone he 
had loved had died in his arms and 
once he had had to blow the whistle 
on the best friend he ever had, who 
died of it. This thing he had just 
heard was like all those at once; it 
made him bite his tongue the same 
way. It could be that he heard 
nothing at all for a long moment 
because he didn't want to hear 
anything else; he wanted to tip 
time backward and not know what 
he had just been told. He came 



NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT 



53 




back slowly — as if someone had a 
volume control to bring up sound 
gradually from silence — and heard 
Dr. Poole say something about 
cloud formation. 

“There’s a central mountain 
range and, like all such, it has 
cloud cover most of the day. 
Lasvogel thinks the chemical fog 
went in over the city and upslope 
on a thermal current. He really 
had no idea the stuff would work in 
dilutions like that, but it did. 
When it got to the cloud it 
dispersed right through it in a few 
hours — well, he had anticipated 
that part. Then, of course, it 
rained. It rains every day in that 
place for a little while. It was the 
rain that brought it down on the lee 
side — so, you see, the whole place 
was covered. 

Merrihew recognized a flicker of 
surprise in himself when he tried 
his voice and it worked. “Anybody 
live in those mountains — or are 
they all in the city?” 

“I see what you’re thinking,” 
Dr. Poole said. “Maybe we missed 
someone. Well, forget it. Yes, 
there are villages and small hold- 
ings all through the area. But 
you’ve got to accept what 1 said: 
we’ve had the whole place bugged 
for years now — crossroads clinics, 
private doctors, the pathological 
labs and the mid wives. Trust the 
figures.” 

“How big is the white popula- 
tion?” 

“Less than five percent. Two 



couples from the Peace Corps who 
settled there, some teachers and 
doctors, business people. Also 
some East Indian settlements and 
orientals. No pregnancies there 
either. Just Caucasians.” 

Merrihew’s steak was cold. He 
put his fork down. “Too big to get 
hold of all at once. You’re taking 
a hell of a chance telling anyone 
about this. Even me.” 

“Stick that in your cap for a 
feather. The record says you can 
be trusted.” 

Merrihew looked him in the eye. 
“Nobody can be trusted with this 
one. All I can do is the best I can. 
Let’s get back to work.” 

“Work? Ah. Your part in this, 
you mean. All I can tell you is what 
needs to be done and let you take it 
from there. I can’t tell you what to 
do.” He smiled briefly. “From 
what I hear, nobody can. That’s 
how you work.” 

“Lasvogel,” Merrihew said 
tersely. He meant. Get to the point. 

“Very well. Lasvogel is the key 
to everything. He’s on the track of 
an answer and he will come 
through— although maybe 1 say 
that because 1 have no alterna- 
tive. But I’m afraid he won’t last 
the stretch. He’s under some kind 
of pressure that’s brought him to 
the breaking point and I’m 
scared.” 

“I’m scared just hearing about 
it.” 

“Oh, you don’t understand. It 
isn’t West Ecuador. I know the 



54 



GALAXY 




man. I’ve seen him under 
stress — work stress — before. This 
is something different. Some- 
thing outside. It isn’t physical — I 
have the right to order an ex- 
amination and I did that, though 
I thought he was going to spit in 
my eye. All I got out of that is what 
1 already knew — he’s under stress. 
Dr. Genovese— the Institute head 
medic — laid it to work pressure 
and told him to ease up, told me to 
ease up, too. But I know better.” 

“How?” 

Dr. Poole almost shrugged, al- 
most gestured, barely shook his 
head. “Call it intuition. Call it my 
special talent the way you’d call 
Lasvogel’s problem-solving a 
special talent. We give things 
names and think we have answers. 
They aren’t answers but some- 
times they make us feel better.” 
He drew a deep breath. “Anyway, 
your problem is Lasvogel. Find 
out what's cutting him up and give 
me an idea of what can be done 
about it. Your problem is not 
West Ecuador. He’ll handle that. 
Here.” He removed an envelope 
from his breast pocket and handed 
it to Merrihew. “Here’s a per- 
sonnel profile plus all the 
addresses, telephone numbers 
and peripheral information you 
can possibly need. Numbers you 
can reach me twenty-four hours a 
day — and don’t hesitate on that 
one. A drawing account. It 
doesn’t say so on the paper, but 
believe me, it’s open-ended. And 



I’ve bothered to write one thing 
down in red; Respect Lasvogel's 
privacy. He’s obsessive about that. 
He must never have the slightest 
suspicion that you’re on the job or 
what the job is. I can put it to you 
this way: he’s the most totally de- 
voted and conscientious man 1 
have ever met, but if he thought he 
was being spied on, he’d quit the 
Institute — West Ecuador and all. 
The only other thing 1 have to say 
to you is something that doesn’t 
need saying: God help us if West 
Ecuador goes on much longer the 
way it is. Already there will have 
to be a wrinkle in the birth statis- 
tics that some sharp eyes will pick 
up. Imagine nine months from 
now when the news gets out that 
there’s a place where there have 
been no non-white births in a pop- 
ulation of two million. You feel 
all right, Merrihew?” 

Merrihew stood up. “I feel we've 
been sitting here too long. Talk- 
ing too much.” 

“But ” 

“You said it was all in here,” 
and Merrihew tapped the 
envelope. “You better be right.” 
And he ran out. 



II 

S LIT-EYED, thin-lipped, Merri- 
hew went straight to a place he 
knew and began to work. 

The place was a park bench off 
the mall, in a little hollow over- 



NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT 



55 




arched by linden trees. Aside from 
turning pages from the envelope, 
which took him less than twenty 
minutes, he sat motionless, legs 
splayed out, eyes all but closed, for 
nearly two hours. 

There were things about this job 
which ran 180 ° out of phase with 
the way he worked, the way he 
thought. Don’t think of exactly 
where West Ecuador is, what it is 
(although “prevailing wind 
situation” and “central range 
with cloud cover ... it rains every 
day there” and the population 
and birth-rate figures put a pin 
right on its map); don’t think of the 
nature of that fog and its power in 
incredible dilutions like that and 
just what that stuff had to be; it was 
Lasvogel’s job to work with 
that — and anyway, Merrihew 
genuinely doubted that any wild 
inspiration of his could even ap- 
proach Lasvogel’s grasp of the 
variables involved. Don’t think of 
ways and means of discovering 
from Lasvogel himself what it was 
that was pulling him apart. Super- 
brain he might be, but Merrihew 
doubted he was so unlike other hu- 
man beings as to be always aware 
of what was wrong with him. He 
probably didn’t know. 

Merrihew liked to work with 
cross-checkable facts, and with the 
truth (whatever, from time to 
time, the hell that might be. In 
this case he had to work with 
“meta-facts” and treat them as if 
they were axioms, knowing per- 



fectly well they weren’t. For ex- 
ample, Lasvogel was the only man 
who could solve the West Ecuador 
mess. Merrihew doubted that, but 
could not let that doubt dilute his 
efforts. And this one: the West 
Ecuador mess can be solved. 
Merrihew doubted this too,, but 
must refuse to let that thought into 
the gears. And this: the difference 
between Lasvogel’s ability and in- 
ability to solve the West Ecuador 
problem lay in keeping him from 
falling apart. Merrihew was per- 
fectly aware that Lasvogel might 
well solve the problem before he, 
Merrihew did anything; or that 
he, Merrihew, might pass a mir- 
acle and restore Lasvogel to 
soundness of mind and soul and 
still Lasvogel might not be able to 
find an answer. 

So all his reasoning and actions 
must spring from this sequence of 
assumptions and almost-facts as 
if they were the word of God, or at 
least Moses. On top of which, 
whatever he did had to be done in- 
stantly and effectively, for literal- 
ly every second made it more likely 
that the news would get out. 

The news would get out . 

He stirred uneasily on the bench; 
he squirmed. Just the fact — no de- 
tails, no hows or wheres- just the 
terrible fact that someone had a 
substance that would secretly and 
painlessly sterilize everyone on 
Earth except Caucasians. Who 
wouldn’t jump at that — jump in 
horror, in greed, even in joy, in 



56 



GALAXY 




terror? It wouldn’t matter what 
details were lacking; that which is 
stated as possible is done. A 
microscopic amount of uranium is 
split leaving its streaks through a 
half cupful of smoke, and once the 
news is out, the thing is done — 
years later, perhaps, billions of 
dollars, hundreds of thousands of 
man-hours later, but it gets done 
and the world is never the same 
again. A man drops dead, seated 
at his desk. There is a bullet 
wound. There is a hole in the win- 
dow glass. The detective draws a 
line from a man’s head, as he sits 
at the desk, through the hole. Bal- 
listics experts alter it to the cor- 
rect parabola and learn where the 
gun was that fired the shot — and 
so on — until a murderer is cap- 
tured. Let it be known that a thing 
has been done and it will be known 
how it was done — if anyone cares 
enough. 

And who would care enough 
about what had happened at West 
Lcuador? Blacks and bigots. 
Clever-mouthed haters, masking 
their diseased passions under a 
cant of believable ecology. And if 
a weapon so potent and so selec- 
tive could be analyzed, why 
couldn’t it be made to select an- 
other target? And if that proved 
impossible, was there any way to 
measure the rage of the target 
now established? 

Merrihew had a thought — per- 
mitted the thought — purely to 
know he had had it and that he had 



eliminated it. Take it to the mili- 
tary, to a wealthy bigot, to the po- 
tential victims of the most horrify- 
ing exercise of genocide known to 
history — even human history. 
One might say conscience would 
dictate something like the last 
course — as for the others, there 
would be fortune incalculable, 
power immeasurable for a man 
who held what he had and used it 
for his own ends. 

Merrihew shuddered and spat. 

Work. Work. Get to work . 

He sat there for another twenty 
minutes, 

“For God’s sake,’’ he said then. 
“What a way to save the world.’’ 

I T WAS all very discreet, of 
course, and in the delicate 
mention of it in Dr. Poole’s 
envelope, the words had all but 
blushed. The fact sheet held a 
strange mix of old-world disap- 
proval and latter-day accept- 
ance, combined with an arch ap- 
petite for gossip. What it came 
down to was that Lasvogel had, in 
addition to a cerebellum, some 
gonads, and that these had been 
preoccupied for some time by one 
Katrin Szabo, expatriate Hungar- 
ian, twenty-four years old, a 
mathematician employed by the 
Institute and living in the same 
apartment house on the same floor 
as Lasvogel. “His association 
with Miss Szabo,’’ said the fact 
sheet primly, “is regarded strict- 



NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT 



57 




ly as Dr. Lasvogel’s concern and 
not the Institute’s business” — 
thereby making it Merrihew’s. 

What a way to save the 
world . 

Merrihew, having carefully 
checked the whereabouts of the 
parties involved, went to the 
apartment house where Lasvogel 
lived, repeating to himself like a 
mantra: Lasvogel's privacy must 
be respected. Lasvogel’s privacy 
must . Oh, he didn’t give a 
damn for Lasvogel’s privacy. Not 
now. What the mantra meant was 
that Lasvogel must not be under- 
estimated. A mind that could do 
that many things in that many 
fields was one that would pick up 
the slightest trace of spying — and 
that one trace would blow the 
whole bit. Merrihew could hard- 
ly contain West Ecuador in his 
memory — he most certainly did 
not want it on his conscience. 
Anything he did in this operation 
would have to be by remote con- 
trol. Anyone he moved or diverted 
must be handled invisibly and 
without touching. 

In an alley — not the one behind 
the apartment house — Merrihew 
became a telephone repairman, 
locked his car and went into Las- 
vogel’s building through the ser- 
vice entrance. The lock on the fire 
tower was a simple matter for 
him. Trudging up eight flights of 
stairs was not. He used the simple 
rhythm of climbing to reinforce 
his mantra. 



The eighth-floor hallway was de- 
serted and had an admirably soft 
carpet. He ghosted up to the door 
of Apartment 8K and tried the 
knob, recalling a nightmarish 
time he had once had picking a 
lock that wasn’t locked. This one 
was and it was a good one. He 
glanced at the key slot and from his 
belt drew out a flat case, opened it. 
From one side he took out the cor- 
rect blank and slid it into the slot. 
From the other side he selected an 
array of flat blades, chose one, 
and gently thrust it into the special 
recess in the blank, applying turn- 
ing pressures, forward and back, 
as he did so. His sensitive fingers 
told him which serration on the 
blade moved which tumbler and 
how much. He withdrew the blade 
and tried another, the third one 
did it and the door opened. He 
went in and closed it quietly be- 
hind him. 

Soundlessly, he whistled. 

Nobody, but nobody, could be 
this neat. 

Carefully, avoiding the rugs 
where possible, he trod the whole 
place, the whole bare minimal 
totally efficient place. 

Here was where a man could 
keep his changes of clothes, could 
wash, could sleep (alone), could eat 
if he wanted to but usually didn’t. 
Here he apparently did not relax, 
did not entertain, did not read or 
watch TV (there was none) and did 
not even study. Well, a man like 
Lasvogel probably did all his 



58 



GALAXY 




studying in his head. He didn't 
need books, and if it was facts he 
wanted, he had two telephones. 
The one with no number on it was 
certainly an open line to the In- 
stitute. 

Merrihew found nothing out of 
place, nothing not strictly Las- 
vogel’s, except the note on the din- 
ette table. 

It was triangular, blue, dated, 
and cuter'n hell: 

Welcome, welcome, wherever you 
are. Problem: to make perfect 
beef Stroganoff exactly as 
you like it, without know- 
ing when you’ll come. 

Need one ingredient: 
Dearest you. 

Waiting, 



L eaning over the table to read 
it without touching it, Merrihew 
noticed the funny little crossbar 
on the 7 of the date, European 
style, and could admire the firm, 
strong, straight, yet completely 
feminine handwriting. He backed 
off a pace to look at the note from 
a distance. From the way it was 
placed on the table, he had a strong 
feeling that it had not been read 
and tossed there. It had been so 
carefully centered most likely by 
the sender, not the receiver. 

And the date? 

Yesterday. 

He continued his hands-off in- 
ventory: bathroom (where he de- 



tected moisture not only on the 
toothbrush but on the soft bristles 
of an old-fashioned badger shav- 
ing brush) and in the tiny kitchen- 
ette, where he made his big find. 

It — they, rather, were in the cup- 
board over the chopping block. 
The small spice rack contained 
salt, pepper, seasoned salt, sea- 
soned pepper — and that was all. 
Beside the rack was an array of 
vitamin capsules — B complex, glu- 
tamic acid and the usual vitamin- 
mineral once-a-day pill. What 
faintly caught his eye, just as he 
turned away, was a glimpse of 
something stashed behind the lit- 
tle spice rack. 

Feeling that perhaps he was 
carrying caution to a ludicrous 
extreme— yet silently chanting his 
mantra again Merrihew got out 
his needle-beam torch and peeked. 
He had to be mildly acrobatic to 
be able to read the labels, but what 
he found was vitamins- two bot- 
tles. One was B complex and iron, 
the other Vitamin E. Unlike the B 
complex out front, which bore the 
name of a reputable drug-store 
chain, these hidden ones were from 
Let's Live! — one of those natural- 
food emporia of which Merrihew, 
a confirmed carnivore, once had 
said, “They sell fruits and nuts to 
the nuts and fruits.” It happened 
that he knew this one; it wasn’t far 
from his office. 

What the hell was Lazvogel 
doing in a place like that? And why 
should he have bought more when 



NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT 



59 




he already had had (Merrihew 
bent to check) two thirds of a bot- 
tle of B Complex? And if Las- 
vogel were simply storing this 
new bottle -why wasn’t the 
Vitamin E out front? 

It looked almost as if he had hid- 
den them. 

Resisting the temptation to find 
out if the bottles really were the 
genuine article — for the screw-on 
caps were sealed with shrunk plas- 
tic Merrihew turned away and 
scanned the counters, the min- 
iscule stove. In the wastebasket 
was a piece of paper a small bag 
with the colophon of the Let 's Live! 
store on it. Merrihew's eye photo- 
graphed just how it lay before he 
reached down and took it by the 
smallest possible corner and lift- 
ed it out. 

Handwriting. 

One of these you really need. 
So much better for you. 
Please take them. The other 
one you don't need at all (!!!) 
Please take them away! 

Love and love 
Rut hie 

Merrihew replaced the crumpled 
bag in the wastebasket precisely 
as he had found it, took one more 
careful look at the whole place and 
let himself out. 

In the envelope Dr. Poole had 
given him there was no Ruthie. 
Hm. 

He walked softly down the hall. 



checking his watch. Still plenty of 
time. He let himself into Apart- 
ment 8D rather more quickly. 

PARTMENT 8D was much 
more to his taste. In its way as 
well ordered as Lasvogel's, it was 
warm, colorful and lived-in -lived- 
in, too, by someone who could 
own a green glass pear and the 
portrait of a smiling collie be- 
cause they were beautiful and not 
because they did anything. The 
kitchenette was no longer than 
Easvogel’s but marvelously 
equipped and organized. The bed 
could sleep two and the presence 
of drapes and spreads, rugs and 
cushions had eliminated that 
acoustically-live effect Las- 
vogel’s place generated, wherein 
one's very thoughts echoed and 
there was nothing to absorb a hu- 
man error. Merrihew, while re- 
taining his detachment, could 
not control the thought that if 
Lasvogel was throwing this away 
he ought to have his glands 
candled. 

Against one wall was a drop-leaf 
table, serving as a desk but ready 
to be used for meals. It bore at the 
moment a block of triangular 
notepaper, blue. He ran a finger- 
tip lightly over its edges and 
nodded. Practical, loo. This was 
Institute stationery with the let- 
terhead guillotined off (making a 
square) and cut again on the diag- 
onal, making that charming tri- 
angular paper.

A piece of it lay on the desk, a 
felt-tipped pen next to it. In the 
strong feminine handwriting he had 
seen on Lasvogel’s table, he read; 

Actually / have no claim on you in 

any way, not even in the simple 

matter of expecting promises 
to be kept, and there is ob- 
viously no reason for me 
to oh, damn, what’s the 
USE. 

The last words sprawled across 
the paper —he could see where the 
violent pen had run clear off onto 
the table top. 

Merrihew's eyebrows twitched. 
Time was when he might have 
raised them. This was obviously 
the end of a long series. The rest 
should be -ahh. 

The wastebasket was half full 
of them. The ones on top were un- 
ruffled, the ones lower down 
crushed, the ones at the very bot- 
tom torn into little bits or twisted 
into tight little knots. 

It must have been a long night. 

He sampled the many drafts. 

Cheerful: Hello there! Remem- 
ber me? I’m the one with the secret 
vice — elaborate beef Stroganoff 
alone in my room. This could lead 
to 

Indignant: It may be that there 
are things in your life far more im- 
portant than — 

Comic: HELP! I am a prisoner 
in a Stroganoff factory! 

Comitragic; To whom it may 
concern: / am an orphaned beef 



Stroganoff. Nobody wants me. 
My noodles are withered and my 
gravy cold. 

Tragicomic: Oh pity the poor 
mathematician with her shining 
hair brushed bright and the bed 
turned down, the wine untouched 
and the Stroganoff cleaving to the 
cold old chafing-dish 

Distraught; Perhaps 1 needed 
this. In no other way could / have 
learned how much I want you, need 
you. It’s so much more than 
mutual pleasure and the joy of 
your nearness. I should be angry 
but instead I’m grateful, but oh. it 
hurts — 

Furious; You rotten bastard, you 
icy son of a bitch, whatever gave 
you the idea that you could treat 
me like — 

Maternal: Nothing matters if 
you’re all right, my dear. There will 
be other times — any time you 
say — or none. If I can help in any 
way, Tm here. If I can help most 
by leaving you alone while you 
work things out. I’ll do that. But I 
am rather desperately worried 
about you. Please eat. 

“Bastard,” Merrihew murmured 
as he carefully replaced the papers 
in the wastebasket. 

It must have been a long night.

used her key and how often,

— ” she had run down the hall to 
that monkish cell, only to find it 
dark and silent and her welcoming 
note unread on his table? Had she 
dozed off some time in the early 
hours and awakened, stiff and 
cramped at het writing table, to 
run down once more and perhaps 
done as Merrihew had just done — 
checked the untenanted cot and the 
damp toothbrush, realizing that 
Lasvogel had come home in the 
gray light to wash and change and 
leave again — smelling probably of 
another woman’s perfume? Smell- 
ing of organic soy sauce and ses- 
ame seed, rather. Who the hell 
was Ruthie? 

What was a guy like Lasvogel, 
with the fate of a whole planet in 
his hands, doing with two abso- 
lutely superfluous time-consuming 
body-and-mind-consuming entan- 
glements like this. 

Merrihew thought about those 
organic vitamins. 

One of them you need . 

That would be the B complex. 
These health nuts were ape for B 
complex and the synthetics Just 
would not do. 

. you don’t need the other 
one, but take them anyway. 

Oh, boy. There used to be a 
whole megillah about the language 
of the flowers, you’d send irises 
and a rose and a hunk of Queen 
Anne’s lace and it meant I am 
panting for you, or some such. 
Nowadays you bring a bottle of 
pills. 



You don't need these (!!!). 

Oh, this Ruthie, she is a cutie. 
Everyone knows Vitamin E’s the 
wildest thing since the prairie 
oyster and Spanish fly. Lasvogel, 
you busy, busy boy, you. So you 
have a date with this Hungarian 
slipstick and her Stroganoff and 
instead you’re out all night with 
your dish of yogurt and her triple 
exclamation points — and you 
with all that homework to do. And 
you bring home your trophies and 
hide them because you know the 
other chick has a key. 

And suddenly Merrihew knew 
what he must do. He knew it as he 
knew that he must do it absolute- 
ly invisibly. 

He had not the compunctions, 
here in Katrin Szabo’s apart- 
ment, that he had had in Las- 
vogel’s austere environment; yet 
when he used the telephone he was 
careful not to move it and to hold 
the receiver with his handker- 
chief. He got his number. 

"Let's live!" said the telephone. 
“Hey man, amen,’’ said Merri- 
hew, who hated people who said 
“man!” “Is Ruthie there?” 

“You mean Ruthie Gordoni.” 
“Godbless, man.” You just told 
me what I wanted to know. But 
Merrihew didn’t say that last part 
out loud. “Look around and see is 
she there for me, man.” 

A pause, then: “Not here. Wish 
she was,” the telephone added gar- 
rulously. “This is a whole differ- 
ent place when she walks in. Some- 



62 



GALAXY 




one said just last night she’s a reg- 
ular Earth Mother.” 

“Far out,” said Merrihew, who 
hated people who say “far out.” 
“She’s the one turned me on to 
your B and liver. I wanted to find 
her and thank her, man. I’m really 
somebody different, man.” 

“That’s Ruthie,” said the tele- 
phone with pride and joy. “Well 
she lives right across the street, so 
she’ll be in. Who shall I say — ” 

“I’ll fall by myself soon, man. 
I’m never out of porkfat molasses 
anyway.” 

“Blackstrap.” 

“That’s what I said, man. So 
later, man.” 

“Right on,” said the telephone 
fashionably and Merrihew hung 
up. He glared sourly at it. “Far 
goddam out, man,” he murmured 
and went looking for the phone 
book. 

He found what he wanted and 
then, pausing only long enough to 
check out the whole place for his 
spoor and finding none, he let 
himself out and returned through 
ihc deserted hallway to Las- 
vogel’s door, which he now opened 
III even less time than he had the 
girl’s. He was there only long 
enough to fish the Let’s Live! bag 
out of the wastepaper basket and, 
III an absolutely perfect copy of 
her handwriting, add the earth- 
mother's last name and street ad- 
dress to her arch little note. He did 
not, however, put it back. He left 
il on the floor beside the basket. In 



that environment it shouted, it 
screamed, it stood out like an oil- 
spill on a talcum beach. 

He went back to his office and 
called Dr. Poole. “Finished,” he 
told that startled gentleman. “I 
got to tell you this: he’ll get worse 
before he gets better — and if you 
try to do anything about it you’ll 
screw everything up. And if you 
call me to tell me bad things have 
happened to him I’ll just say I 
know, I know.” 

Dr. Poole said, “But — ” 
Merrihew was already saying, 
“Goodbye.” 

He then went where phones 
couldn’t reach him for a while. 

What a way to save the world. 



T he waiter went away with 
the order and Merrihew shot a 
look at Dr. Poole. He looked older, 
a little, though it had been barely 
three weeks since the last time. He 
also looked a hell of a lot happier. 

“I can’t tell you exactly what he 
did, of course,” said Dr. Poole. 

Merrihew nodded understand- 
ingly. 

“Secrets, secrets,” he said. 
“Nonsense, man! There are two 
kinds of secrets — the security 
kind, where someone mustn’t find 
out something or you’ll get 
hurt — and the other kind, where 
you’re expected to explain poly- 
mer transformations to a four- 
year-old. You just can't. So as one 
four-year-old to another, I can

merely bumble to you about DNA 
analogs, a chemical integument 
forming temporarily around ripe 
ova, selectivity rather like the 
clumping that forms sickle cells— 
and an overlooked environmental 
factor.” 

“You mean there’s no smog in 
West Ecuador.” 

“Jesus! How did you know 
that?” 

“You told me. Most of it at 
lunch that time. 1 mean. West 
Ecuador could only be one place in 
the whole world, from what you 
told me. And now you mentioned 
‘an overlooked environmental 
factor.’ ” 

“Ah. Ah.” Dr. Poole nodded 
vehemently. “Good thing we — he 
cleared it up as soon as he did. 
Anyway, it’s reformulated com- 
pletely and if anyone should ever 
make the same mistake again we 
can straighten it out in a matter of 
hours. To put it as simply as possi- 
ble, we now have something which 
nullifies conception in any 
warm-blooded vertebrate — but 
only for the current cycle. It 
doesn’t affect the cycle either and 
it has no side effects. It can be 
taken as an individual dose or fog- 
ged — the way we did it at West 
Ecuador — to affect millions. We 
can bend the population curve 
downward anywhere — to any de- 
gree.” 

“And now who gets it? Govern- 
ment? U.N.? Or just you?” 

“You don’t want to know that.” 



“You’re right.” 

The drinks came. Rather hap- 
pily they silently toasted one an- 
other. “Now,” said Dr. Poole, “tell 
me. How did you do it? Matter of 
fact, what did you do?” 

“Maybe 1 should keep my 
secrets, too.” 

“There are two kinds of secret," 
Dr. Poole reminded him. 

Most uncharacteristically, Mer- 
rihew laughed. He did not do it 
very well. Not enough practice. 
"Touche. Un — I drew a hell of a 
slice out of that account you set 
up. 1 wouldn’t want you to regret 
paying out all that money for the 
little 1 did.” 

Dr. Poole waved that away. 
“There’s an old story about a 
mechanic who fixed a big rotary 
printing press by going inside 
and whacking something once with 
a hammer. He billed for $2500.25, 
and when they asked for an ac- 
counting and itemization, he said 
the quarter was for whacking it 
with the hammer. The $2500 was 
for knowing where to whack.” 
“Goddam,” said Merrihew. “1 
was going to tell you that very 
same story.” 

“Tell me what you did.” 

“1 studied your envelope pretty 
carefully. Your Lasvogel shows 
an interesting pattern. He’s a 
multitalented man- -and 1 don’t 
think his talents are completely 
under his conscious control. 
Some people blow up under 
stress. Some people sharpen up. 



64 



GALAXY 




Lasvogel sharpens. The tougher 
the problem — and/or the more 
urgent — the sharper he gets. The 
West Ecuador problem could 
hardly have been tougher or more 
urgent. Every second it got more 
so. Lasvogel, I think, began to get 
a little frantic. I think that may- 
be for the first time in his life he be- 
gan to feel that the problem wasn't 
going to produce enough pressure 
to squeeze out an answer. It began 
to show.” 

“Oh, it did,” breathed Dr. 
Poole. 

Merrihew said, “I don’t for a 
minute believe that Lasvogel con- 
sciously realized why he then did 
what he did. Which was to go out 
and get himself another chick.” 

T he waiter came, puttered, 
chuntered and ultimately went 
away, during which whole time Dr. 
Poole frowned unseeingly at the 
puttering and chuntering. 

“I suppose,” he said when they 
were private again, “that he 
needed to get his mind off the — ” 
“He got a new chick without get- 
ting rid of the old one,” said N(lerri- 
liew. “There is in all the world no 
tnore certain way for a man to get 
himself into trouble than that. 
There’s no more efficient method 
lor a man to complicate things for 
himself, to face more unpredicta- 
ble and unmanageable hassle.” 
“And you were able to stop it.” 
“Haven’t you been listening? My 
(iod, you know him better than I 



do or ever will! Lasvogel has total 
confidence in his ability and he 
had total devotion to the West 
Ecuador problem. I mean he knew 
the answer was in there some- 
where and he knew he wasn’t get- 
ting enough pressure out of the 
work. Even if it was about to 
squash him flat it still wasn’t 
enough to make the answer come. 
So he just went out and bought 
more pressure.” 

“Without knowing why?” 

“I really don’t think so,” said 
Merrihew. “Consciously know- 
ing it would make it game-play- 
ing, not real — and the pressures 
then wouldn’t be real either. Which 
is why playing tricks on yourself 
never works.” 

“Incredible. So — what did you 
do?” 

“Nothing essential. What hap- 
pened was inevitable, so in a way 
you didn’t need me at all. On the 
other hand, I did make the inevit- 
able happen a hell of a lot sooner, 
which is why you got your prob- 
lem solved when you did.” 

“Why we got it solved, period,” 
Dr. Poole asserted warmly. “Las- 
vogel was at the bitter end, be- 
lieve me.” 

“You’d know,” conceded Merri- 
hew. “I don’t — I never saw the guy. 
Or the chicks. That was the only 
real trouble I had — making it hap- 
pen without touching anybody. 
So 1 just did what you scientist 
types called bringing in a force or 
factor which is necessary and

sufficient. I saw to it that the two 
girls got to know each other. I 
knew your Miss Szaho was due 
home before Lasvogel, and that 
she would sit down and brood a bit, 
that she woyld get mad and barge 
into his place and that she would 
not only see the evidence I left for 
her but would snatch it up and take 
it away with her.” 

“What evidence?” 

“The other woman’s name and 
address.” 

“But how would that guaran- 
tee — ” 

“It was guaranteed, if you know 
Miss Szabo.” 

“You seem to have gotten to 
know her quite well.” 

“Never saw her,” said Merri- 
hew, watching, behind his eyes, a 
succession of careful blue trian- 
gles, lines of strong, angry, de- 
voted, injured handwriting. “But 
in a way you’re right. 1 knew she’d 
go straight there and have it out.” 
“What happened?” 

“We’ll never know. Whatever it 
was, Lasvogel walked in on it.” 
“That must have been the night 
he limped into the lab with the 
scratches on his face and the big 
bruise on his cheekbone.” 
“Language of love,” said Merri- 
hew. “One of ’em.” 

“And by morning he had the new 
formulation.” 

“Pressure enough,” said Merri- 
hew, spreading his hands in a 
Q.E.D. gesture. “Necessary and 
sufficient.” 



“Oh, dear,” said Dr. Poole 
thoughtfully. 

“What is it?” 

“I can’t complain, I suppose. I 
said before — you heard me — that 
if Lasvogel solved this one he 
could retire with honor. In effect 
he probably has —and we won’t be 
getting much from him from now 
on.” 

“Why?” 

Dr. Poole leaned forward with 
his 1-don’t-gossip-but-you-should- 
know expression. “This wouldn’t 
be a Miss Ruth Gordoni?” 

“No,” said Merrihew. “Ruthie.” 

“Ah. Well, Lasvogel has moved, 
you know. Taken a house. And ac- 
cording to my sources Miss Szabo 
has moved in with him. And, ah. 
Miss Gordoni also. They seem to 
have become fast friends, all 
three.” 

And Merrihew really did laugh, 
this time. “Friend,” he said, put- 
ting his hand on Dr. Poole’s shoul- 
der, “You’re going to get work 
out of Lasvogel like you never 
got before. And he’s still got a 
lot to do if the totalitarian prin- 
ciple of physics inherent in this 
mess is to be kept permanently at 
bay. It goes something like this: 
‘Anything not forbidden is com- 
pulsory . ’ He’s found a way to 
keep the pressure on and an en- 
vironment that won’t even let him 
get sick. Beef Stroganoff with 
Vitamin E sauce — ” and he dis- 
solved into laughter again and 
wouldn’t explain. ★

I ’M AIRBORNE, flying through 
a crystal night, and unbidden 
ideas and thoughts keep wander- 
ing into and out of my head. These 
they are ordinarily wont to do, but 
more now than usually. Par ex- 
emple: 1 thinlc of Saint-Ex doing 
his thing over the Andes — and over 
France, over other places. Just 
now I’m doing some kind of thing 
over mid-U.S.A. and unbidden 
thoughts come into my mind. I 
think of my first girl, the really 
first one, and I’m filled with some- 
thing like shame because suddenly 
I can’t remember her name. She 
was good to me and you shouldn’t 
forget the name of the first girl 
who was good to you. I’m not al- 
ways proud of myself. My real 
now girl, though, is beside me as 
we fly through the night, and 1 
know her name right well: Alice. 

I think, among other things, of 
reading; reading my way through 
grade school, through high school, 
even into college. Reading in the 
lofts of barns in August, in cold 
libraries in November and once — 
a special time — reading in a se- 
cret place where the only things 
that mattered at all were being 
with my girl and — before and after 
that — reading lovely things togeth- 
er. That was before Alice. 

When 1 was a kid (this is one of 
the thoughts wandering into my 
head as 1 look at the lights below 
and think of reading) there already 
had been too many computer leg- 
ends. 1 read them because I had an 



interest. In most the computers 
were taking over the world, run- 
ning everything — you know. 

1 checked an old favorite the 
other night and it began like this: 
The Computer broods in a cavern 
in a mountain not far from Den- 
ver, Colorado. It has no name, 
needing none. It needs no name be- 
cause it's the only one . 

It was a good story, but it 
hadn’t been quite right; in the ac- 
tual event the locus was closer to 
Colorado Springs than to Denver. 
And when I, in due course, made 
the acquaintance of The Computer 
I found that it wasn’t the only one, 
just the only one in what we per- 
sist in calling the Western World. 
There were two others, in the ex- 
pected two other places; such, 
however, were the linkages be- 
tween them that, when you got 
right down to it, the three were one 
organism. 

I discovered that The Computer 
really did brood, deep within its 
cavern, because it didn’t have 
much to do. It ran the world, yes, 
but that didn’t begin to stretch it 
to capacity. It strained like a mint- 
condition old Offy would strain 
at 40 MPH. It wasn’t mountain- 
size, of course, but it was inside a 
mountain for reasons of security. 
Quite a bit of it was at work from 
time to time, but mostly the work 
was routine, a drag, and the part 
of it that didn’t have anything to 
do — brooded. How else can you 
think of it? 



68 



GALAXY 




The Computer was made most- 
ly by young men and was pro- 
grammed to trust no one under 
thirty. And how did I come into all 
this? I say (with mixed feelings) 
that my great-grandfather, when a 
young man, was one of the big 
brains behind it. And my grand- 
father and father had worked for 
it, so I had a family interest as well 
as a personal one. 

I turned to Alice. 

“Do you remember my thir- 
tieth birthday," I asked. 

“I do," she said. 

Sunlight through an un- 
openable window and con- 
ditioned air into the house 
from points beyond count- 
ing. A spring day and in the 
room a mother and her live- 
ly young girl of eight. 

“I want to go to the 
park," the girl says. Her 
name is Jean. Jean's mother 
sighs, reflecting upon the 
mixed-bag quality of the 
times when Jean is not re- 
quired to be in school. “We 
went four days ago." 

“I want to go again," Jean 
says. “I want to walk on the 
grass with my shoes off.” 

“That would be nice, Jean, 
but 1 think it’s too soon. 
Well, push the button." 

The girl knew precisely 
where, in the complex array 
of buttons, the one labeled 
Park was. She carefully 



crossed her fingers before 
pushing the familiar button. 
Events took place in silicon 
chips in Colorado and the 
light came up red. 

“I’m sorry, darling. We’ll 
be able to go again soon. We 
have to share it. You know." 
The girl kicked the base of 
the panel. “Don’t do that, 
Jean.” 

Jean stood at the window 
and looked out into the 
park. There were people in 
it not too many, not too 
few, just the right number. 

I’ll be thirty tomorrow and after 
that I’ll be spending four hours a 
day inside that Colorado moun- 
tain, looking after one module of 
that Thing. The part I’ll be respon- 
sible for is no larger than a ‘small 
library, but "it’s reasonably com- 
plex and I don’t expect to be 
bored. 

Maintenance is compartmented. 
I’m supposed to know everything 
about my module, or section 
(219A), down to the last micro- 
scopic memory chip, but nothing 
about any other. 

I’ve said that three of my imme- 
diate ancestors were related to The 
Computer. 1 want to go inside that 
mountain. 

“You have decided on 
your project?” 

The man behind the desk 
smiled, put the tips of his 
fingers together, looked 



lAKEOVER

from the face of the boy to 
the ceiling, then back. The 
boy was fourteen and his 
name was Emile. Derek Ar- 
pel, the man behind the desk, 
was Emile’s science teacher. 
He saw something in the 
boy’s eyes and didn’t look at 
the ceiling again. 

“Yes?” he said. 

“I’m going to build a 
model of the Tower of the 
Eight Winds.” 

“The Tower of — ” 

“Yes. A working model. 
1 think 1 can do it. It will 
have eight sides, you know, 
one for each of the eight 
winds, and each will be a 
sundial and inside the tower 
will be a water clock, like 
this.” 

Emile unfurled large un- 
ruly sheets of paper, which 
bore beautifully done draw- 
ings. Derek Arpel cleared 
his throat and made as if to 
swallow. He hummed a lit- 
tle and said meaningless 
monosyllables. 

“The reservoir for the 
water clock will be here,” the 
boy said, speaking rapidly. 
“It must always be full, so 
the pressure will be constant. 
It will be such fun,” he said. 
He showed, talking all the 
time, how the water would 
flow from the reservoir into 
another tank, filling it in 
just twenty-four hours. 



“This is a float in the tank,” 
he said, “and a line from the 
float goes here — and there — 
and as the float rises this 
plate goes around, once ev- 
ery twenty-four hours. There 
will be a chart of the sky 
drawn on it. The marker — 
this grid — shows what time it 
is. It will be held by Hercules 
on one side. Atlas on the 
other — here.” 

He stopped to catch his 
breath. Derek Arpel looked 
at the drawings and looked 
at Emile. He shook his head 
slightly. 

“I didn’t make it up my- 
self,” Emile said. “It’s a 
copy.” 

“Where — ” 

“In the rare book vault of 
the library. In an old Ameri- 
can Journal of Archaeology. 
It’s on tape.” 

“You are authorized?” 
“Oh, yes.” He showed the 
Teacher a card. 

“I meant,” the Teacher 
said, “where was the — orig- 
inal Tower of the Eight 
Winds?” 

“In Athens,” Emile said, 
squaring his narrow shoul- 
ders. “First Century BC, old 
lime. Do you think it will — 
go, sir?” Emile looked into 
the old man’s eyes, saw 
something flickering there. 
“It would be so beautiful.” 
“Yes. Yes,” said the 



70 



GALAXY 




Teacher. “I believe it would 
be so. All right, you know 
what you have to do.” He 
waved a hand toward the 
console and the boy seated 
himself before it. He recited 
his prepared copy into the 
mike and events happened 
upon and within the silicon 
wafers in the mountain. The 
answer wasn’t long in com- 
ing. 

The boy rolled up his 
plans, crumpled the copy of 
his proposal in his fist. 

“It would have been a 
lovely thing,” he said. 



M y TH I RTI ETH birthday came 
on a Saturday, which meant 
lhat my new job, for which I’d 
Iteen so endlessly trained, would 
start on the following Monday. 1 
suggested to Alice that a celebra- 
tion was in order. She said she 
wasn’t so sure. 

1 asked, “What do you mean by 
that?” 

“I didn’t mind moving to Colo- 
rado, and you know it. but 1 don’t 
like the idea of you working for 
lhat — Thing. I hate it.” 

This wasn’t new territory; we 
had crisscrossed it before. We had 
lived with it for a while. 

“It’s a little late to do anything 
about it now,” I said. “So let’s 
make do with it at least until we 
see how it goes. All right?” 

“I don’t like it. Who says you 



have to work for The Computer 
anyway?” 

I sighed and said the Com- 
puter. And that ended that. 

The ages of eighteen and twenty- 
one had, I knew, historically been 
ages of significance, but they didn’t 
mean much now. Thirty was the di- 
viding line and I found that I 
crossed that threshold in a state of 
some internal conflict. I won’t 
say that part of me didn’t look 
forward to my new job — didn’t, in 
fact, insist that that was obvious- 
ly what 1 had to do. My emotional 
view of the Computer was as yet 
amorphous, a coin with blurred 
images on either side, images 
which would no doubt sharpen in 
due course. On the negative side, 
I didn’t like the red lights and, 
though I’m no philosopher, 1 was 
obscurely uneasy about the im- 
plications of those red lights, 
what they said other than. No, you 
can’t do that now, not today. On 
the other side was — well, not much, 
but The Computer did run in the 
family and I did, though Alice was 
genuinely unhappy about it, 
want to go into the mountain. 

Time first, though, for cham- 
pagne, a few friends and desultory 
conversation before they left. My 
birthday, yes. As guests (almost 
always) eventually do, ours left, 
and I was soon in bed with Alice. 1 
was tired and it was nice to stretch, 
sleepy head on pillow, feeling her 
stretching against me. 

“Nice party,” I piumbled, “but

I’m glad they went when they did.” 

“Yes," Alice said. “Yes.” She 
snuggled and one thing in inevi- 
table sequence led to another and 1 
wasn’t tired any more. “Push the 
button, damn it, dear Harry. You 
know we have fo do that.” 

“Yes, I do,” I said, fooling 
around some more. 1 do, indeed.” 

1 got myself out of bed and over 
to the console. Before pushing the 
appropriate button I thought a mo- 
ment, seeking wisdom from ano- 
malous sources. In a day and a half 
I’d be going into that mountain, 
whose guts I was now about to 
address. 

“Harry?” 

I pushed the button. Condition 
red. I crawled back into bed. 

“Red?” she asked. 

“Yes.” 

“Screw it,” she said. “Damn it, 
screw it.” But you can’t screw The 
Computer. The converse wasn’t 
quite true. Before I was able to set- 
tle down much she said, “So let’s 
do it anyway.” 

We’d been through this before, 
too, though Alice was a very bright 
girl. 

“You know we can’t,” 1 said. 
Sensorship. Alice knew as well as 
I that if we made love then and 
there, in the voyeuristic presence of 
that red signal, the little sensor 
within both our selves would signal 
Violation and soon unpleasant 
consequences would flow from 
that. 

“Why not?” asked Alice, not re- 



signed. “Why can’t we? When we 
both feel like it. It’s your birth- 
day — ” 

“It’s all optimized,’’ I said. 
“Frequency as a function of age, 
temperament, twenty other 
factors. You know that as well 
as — ” 

“Damn it to hell,” she said. 
“You can bet your sweet life on 
one thing, that computer doesn’t 
know my optimums from its — ” 
“It’s what?” 

“It doesn’t have one.” She sat in 
bed next to me, her strawberry nip- 
ples darting accusatory glances my 
way, and said, “I want you. Now. 
Let’s do it anyway.” 

“Listen, love,” I said, though I 
knew I fought a lost cause. “Lis- 
ten — 1 love you more than I can 
say. 1 do. But on Monday 1 go into 
the mountain, and 1 can’t have The 
Computer in dispute with me now. 
Or vice versa. Understand that.” 
And she tried to. And she snug- 
gled against me, but angrily, and 
there was no comfort in it. 

Y TRAINING had been 
thorough, elaborate and exten- 
sive, all of it carried out with the 
help of a presumably authentic and 
life-size copy of the module over 
which I would preside. This appa- 
ratus was housed in one fairly 
large room of an unobtrusive in- 
stallation not far from the moun- 
tain. There were other places like it 
here and there throughout the 
country, I knew, but mine was the 




72 



GALAXY 




only one 1 had ever seen. Curiosity 
about modules other than your 
own was not encouraged. 

My own bucket of bolts, when 1 
had finished training, had no se- 
crets left to keep from me, not in 
respect of keeping it going, which 
was all my job was supposed to be. 
It itself didn’t (it was always an it 
to me; 1 couldn’t think of it as a he 
or she), but there were two small 
appendages, guarded chambers, I 
had no access to. One was input, 
the other was output — simulacra 
of the module’s relationship to 
the rest of The Computer, of 
course. 

The green light had come on 
Sunday night, but Alice was still 
sulky and it hadn’t made any dif; 
ference. The red light can stop 
you, but the green doesn’t neces- 
sarily get you anywhere — in con- 
sequence of which I entered the 
mountain under two banners: 
animosity and curiosity. 

The gadgetry was as expected. 
The few places I was allowed to 
enter responded either to my voice 
or to the pressure of the palm of 
my right hand upon a panel. These 
sensors made elevators go up or 
down and they opened some doors. 
Not all, by a long shot, but some. 
There were long corridors with for- 
bidding portals, most of which 
were immune to the touch of my 
palm. Everything was battleship 
gray, which was fitting in view of 
the watertight bulkheading (I 
speak analogously) separating 



the different parts of The Com- 
puter. The whole thing, Judging by 
what I could see of it, was surpris- 
ingly small. 

What was it like to live with the 
thing, to have it part of my life for 
four hours a day, except 1 couldn’t 
leave it at the end of the fourth 
hour; it stayed there through the 
other twenty as well? What was it 
like to be a part of the human ap- 
paratus that kept it going? What 
did I do? I’ll tell you what it was 
like to live with it in a moment — 
but, first, what I did was detect 
malfunctioning circuits a few min- 
utes before they malfunctioned. 1 
wandered here and there amid all 
that hardware. I tired of sitting at 
the master console, waiting for 
something to happen. I felt the 
presence of all those silicon wa- 
fers, mindlessly bearing their mi- 
crominiature circuits. I thought of 
the other rooms I couldn’t get in- 
to. 1 thought of what was going on 
out there in consequence of what 
was going on in here. 

What was it like to live with The 
Computer? It was, in the end, like 
living with your mother-in-law, 
whose untimely death you plan. 

N OW and again the red light con- 
flicted with my need — and now 
and then with Alice’s — but most 
frequently with both at the same 
time and those were bad times. Oc- 
casionally, though, the green came 
at just the right time and we ex- 
ploded into such a mutual pyro- 



TAKEOVER 



73 




technic brilliance that 1 won- 
dered, briefly, if maybe The Com- 
puter had the right idea after all. 
That wonder never lasted long, 
only until the next red light. 

Alice, of course, hated The 
Computer with frightening inten- 
sity. “And I hate your Great- 
great-God-damned-grandfather 
Charles H. Justice also,” she 
would say, sitting in bed, looking 
at me. She didn’t hate me — she 
loved me, dear girl— but I served 
The Computer and that came be- 
tween us in both obvious and sub- 
tle ways. For one, she really didn’t 
understand the extent to which 
the thing ran in the family. 

“Not my great-great-grandfa- 
ther,” 1 would say. “Just great.” 

She hated him anyway. 

My first months with The Com- 
puter were spent in a state of ex- 
treme ambivalence Phase 1, if 
you will, of The Computer And I. 1 
admired The Computer, what it 
could do, how effortlessly it ac- 
complished, what a magnificent 
something it was. I came, in a 
way, to be fond of it - to be fond, at 
least, of my part of it. My great- 
grandfather had been there, after 
all, and I was not immune to a 
sense of family pride. 

I had anxieties enough the first 
day or two, but after the first week 
I was reasonably secure with my 
module and we began to develop 
our relationship. 1 liked the aseptic 
neatness of it all, the banks of 
indicator lights of many colors. 



The other side of my attitude 
built itself upon the occasional red 
light The Computer gave me, us, 
and what that did to Alice and me, 
to our relationship — and, in the 
back of my mind, what it was do- 
ing to and for everybody else. 

My function within the moun- 
tain was to maintain module 219A. 
My relation to The Computer was 
supposed to be analogous to that of 
the service technician who re- 
places the reactor in your aerocar, 
say, except that my job was more 
specialized. 1 was supposed to 
know everything there was to know 
about how to keep one small part 
of The Computer working, so 
others could use it. Actually I 
didn’t — and don’t — know if there 
are, or were, “others” in this sense. 
1 was inclined to doubt it. 1 
thought The Computer had be- 
come autonomous. 

We were supposed to maintain, 
then, and to do so without curios- 
ity, but I’ve already said I took cu- 
riosity inside the mountain with me 
that first day. So I did more than 
keep the thing running, I studied it. 
And one of the ways of studying it 
was to play back used chips before 
1 sent them off from my module to 
wherever it was they went. This 
was, of course, against all 
regulation, but 1 had a recently 
acquired secret weapon and was 
able to bypass the monitoring 
circuits which would have sig- 
naled Violation... 

My secret weapon, yes. After I’d 



74 



GALAXY 




been working for The Computer a 
month or so my father, who had 
been retired for years, called me 
from San Francisco. He had just 
gotten back from Japan and had 
forgotten my birthday until my 
mother reminded him of it. He had 
something for me and could 1 re- 
ceive it without arousing notice or 
curiosity? He would like, he said, 
to have a look at 2 19 A again (past- 
maintainers had that privilege), 
and could come to the mountain 
tomorrow. Besides, he said, he 
would like to see Alice and me. It’s 
not a large package, he said. 

“Why the cloak-and-dagger?” I 
asked. 

“Never mind,” he said. 

“Will it go in a scooter?” 

“Yes.” 

Communications like this were 
not monitored. The design intent 
and supposition were that the sen- 
sors everyone carried inside 
him/herself were all The 
Computer needed to keep things 
under control. 

“Put it in my scooter in the lot at 
the mountain,” I said, and 1 gave 
its number. “I'll smuggle it into 
the house later.” 

Security began at the one and 
only entrance into the mountain. 
There wasn’t much need for it out- 
side. 

“Right,” my father said. And 
the next day I had my secret 
weapon. That evening, after Alice 
was asleep (we’d had a pleasant 
enough visit with my father), I 



stashed it in a closet in my study. 

And soon after that I was play- 
ing back memory chips. I couldn’t 
bypass my internal sensor, not 
then, so 1 had to play it cool, which 
was usually not much of a problem 
since most of the business of run- 
ning a world is rather dull stuff. 
But there were times when I found 
The Computer saying No when I 
thought it should say Yes. As for 
example, when the boy wanted to 
build The Tower of the Eight 
Winds. When I read the printout 
on that one. Phase I was finished. 
Phase I: ambivalence. 

Phase II? Growing distrust and 
reorganization, as if a bright boy of 
six or seven, maybe, had discov- 
ered for the first time that his fa- 
ther wasn’t always right. 

I wouldn’t want to make a gen- 
eral rule about what comes next in 
series that begin with ambivalance 
and progress to distrust and be- 
yond, but in this case the next term 
was — simply a mind-clutching 
need to destroy. Though Phase 1 
had transmogrified in a matter of 
seconds into Phase II, the corre- 
sponding evolution into Phase HI 
was undramatic and gradual. And 
irreversible. 

What came into 219A were, in 
any large sense, trivia. Maybe triv- 
ia was all the input the other mod- 
ules had as well, since everything 
was, shall we say, under control. 
People beyond counting wanted to 
cohabit and got the red light — and 
that was tiresome, but routine. A

poet wanted to up his output to 
twenty-four lines a week — from 
twenty. Negative. A rather nice old 
man (or so he sounded) had made a 
mistake and wanted to go back to 
his first wife, th^ still loved each 
other. An enfant terrible tapped in- 
to The Computer a reasoned argu- 
ment why man should resume the 
exploration of space. And so and 
so and so on. 

The effect of these illicit play- 
backs was like the ancient Chinese 
water torture — small insults, each 
of them, but cumulating expo- 
nentially into an asymptotic need 
to undo the thing. 

I mentioned control above. Yes. 
Many are the faces of immorality, 
and of these the dingiest calls itself 
control. Quoted, by permission, 
from the extensively unpublished 
Beatitudes of Harry S. Justice. 
Sorry about that name, by the way, 
but you can’t help what you were 
born to. 

I WAS in my study — studying, 
appropriately enough — and 
Alice was asleep. 1 was as deep as 1 
could go into the lower left bowel 
of The Computer, learning more 
about (among other things) what a 
special module 219A was. At least 
I thought Alice was asleep, or I 
wouldn’t have had the books out. 
But she wasn’t — or she’d 

wakened — and she came in and 
surprised me. That let one cat out 
of the. bag and our relationship 
changed in the next hour because 1 



could see what was coming not far 
ahead. I wanted to level with her 
because she is a dear girl and 1 
love her and it was time for me to 
share the burden, part of it. I was 
glad she had come in. 

“What in the name of God,’’ she 
asked, standing in the doorway, 
flimsily clad, hands on hips, con- 
cern in her eyes and love in her 
voice, “are you doing up so 
late — and what in the other name 
of God are thoseV' 

She pointed to the three enor- 
mous volumes. I’d stashed them 
well. She had never seen them be- 
fore, though our house was small. 

My secret weapon. 

“Sit down here,’’ I said, touch- 
ing her here and there, but my 
heart not in it, not then. “I’ll make 
you a drink.’’ 

When I came back she was in the 
chair, small and huddled. I saw 
that 1 had communicated before I 
had said anything. 1 went to the 
bedroom, came back, put a wrap 
over her shoulders. She pulled up 
her feet. She was like a little girl. I 
sat in my chair at the desk. 

“A good drink,” 1 said, “though 
I made it myself.” Alice started to 
say something. “These,” 1 said, 
hamming it up a bit to keep it 
cool, “are the notebooks of my 
great-grandpappy, Charles H. 
justice the First ” Alice’s pupils 
dilated-- “and they comprise, in 
effect, two entities.” I had my 
audience, all right. I hate your 
great-etc. -grandfather, Alice had 



76 



GALAXY 




said from time to time. “One,” I 
continued, “is, in all practical ef- 
fect, a schematic of The Com- 
puter. The other is a dictionary to 
the language of the master pro- 
gram.” 

“But- ” She seemed so small 
now, in the chair. So afraid. 

“But I'm not supposed to have 
them — right,” 1 said. “That’s why 
they aren't on microfilm there'd 
be a record, somewhere in that 
monster, of their existence. These 
are all from my grandpappy’s own 
hand.” 

“When did you start calling him 
grandpappy?” 

“Just now.” 

1 had always admired Alice's as- 
tuteness. She rose from her chair, 
came to stand beside me and 
thumb through some of the pages. 
None of it meant anything to her, 
of course. Then she sat down again. 
We talked some more and 1 could 
see the wheels going around in her 
head like reels of tape in early- 
generation computers. She stood 
again, the wrap falling from her 
shoulders. She put her hands on 
my desk. 

“Kill it then!” she cried, almost 
screamed. “Kill it!” She had be- 
gun to have an inkling of what 1 
had going for me — us — in these 
notebooks and then she wasn’t 
afraid, she was wild. Suddenly she 
checked herself and paled. 
“Christ,” she said, “my stupid 
blood pressure, my so responsive 
heart rate. 1 have— ” 



She sat down, not, 1 thought, 
really afraid, but trying to keep 
her powder dry, not wanting to 
throw shock waves into the 
mountain — not now. 

“It’s all right,” 1 said. 

“How do you know? 1 may 
have — ” 

“Tonight it’s all right,” 1 said. 

I made another drink and we 
talked some more, but I didn’t tell 
her — I was saving that for later, to 
be told more by way of demon- 
stration than by explication — that 
two days past I’d located and in- 
activated the receiver inputs of 
our own two personal sensors. 

I also failed to mention that I 
had Charles H. Justice the First 
figured. These notebooks were 
grandpappy’s moral insurance 
policy. When they’d put The 
Computer together back then they 
hadn’t known how it would work 
out. Grandpap had tried to see to 
it that if it didn’t, some descendant 
would be in the right place to take 
care of it. That’s the way I put it 
together. There weren’t any step- 
by-step instructions, though, no 
advice, just a comprehensive 
introduction to the totality of The 
Computer — a letter of credit, as it 
were, and I’d have to decide on my 
own how to spend it. 

We had a long talk that night. 
On the way to bed I pushed the but- 
ton. I demonstrated my intentions 
at once, in bed, despite the red 
light. Alice didn’t know what to do. 

“The console is on,” I said.

“but we, you and I, are discon- 
nected. From The Computer, that 
is.” 

She didn’t quite believe it at first, 
but when she did she gave it all she 
had. It was like being alone togeth- 
er for the first ‘time ever — which 
isn’t surprising, because that’s what 
it was. Mercy! 

“My dear sweet boy,” Alice 
said, about to sleep. “You’ll have 
to kill it anyway.” 

“Mmm,” I mmmed. 

“For all the others,” she said. 

F our hours a day don’t take too 
much out of a man’s life. 1 had 
plenty of time the next four weeks 
to study the notebooks. Not to 
Alice’s dismay. She thought, 
though we didn’t talk about it, that 
I was plotting the death of The 
Computer. She was right. 

What are the ways of the death 
of a computer? Simple lack of 
maintenance would carry it off 
in reasonably short order, one 
malfunctioning circuit leading 
to the failure or inutility of 
others, until it progressed into 
rampaging psychosis or veg- 
etating moronity, death in either 
case. But this computer’s main- 
tenance was impeccable. The- 
oretically The Computer could 
be programed to knock itself out, 
as if a human leaped from an aero- 
car for lack of anything better to 
do or because something or some- 
one told him to do so. But The 
Computer had built-in safe- 



guards which were, I knew, be- 
yond the reach of me and my note- 
books. There was, of course, al- 
ways the simplest of all roads to 
destruction; force, man — brute 
force. 

I WAS ready in four weeks. It 
took me that long, first to find 
what I was looking for, then to 
figure how to make it work. It was, 
if I may say so, a fancy piece of 
reprograming. 1 wondered if the 
other two parts of The Computer 
had equivalent 219A modules in 
them. I supposed so, but 1 didn’t 
suppose either of them had a Harry 
S. Justice tinkering with their 
private parts. 

All I told Alice was that we’d be 
taking off that evening in the aero- 
car. I gave her what would ordi- 
narily have been a weird packing 
list — sleeping bags, as much of our 
heavier clothing as we could car- 
ry, lots of food, water, vodka, 
some books (no microfilms), 
simple medications, things like 
that. 

“And any little thing you 
wouldn’t want to lose,” I said. 

1 had been, and was, curiously 
unable to talk to Alice during that 
time and I wasn’t much good at 
talking to myself either. What do 
you say to yourself when you’ve 
fitted yourself into some kind of 
Great Archcriminal slot? Yes, 
there were things to be said on the 
other side. In spite of The Compu- 
ter we still had the fear of the bomb

hidden away in the corners of our 
minds and that wouldn’t be there 
any more. 

My last day in the mountain I 
voiced in the program just before I 
left. I suppose I hoped it would 
work. Some of the hardware was 
pretty old. But it was there, all 
right. 

“Let’s go,’’ 1 said when 1 got 
home. 

Alice was pale and tense, under 
control. She hadn’t asked a ques- 
tion during those four weeks. 1 
looked around the place a minute 
or so, and we got into the aerocar. 
The door clunked and I punched in 



the long-range coordinates for 
southwestern New Hampshire — 
that seemed a good a place as any 
and as far away as we could go. 
We got clearance in three minutes. 
I’d taken care of that, too. 

At 23,000 feet Alice asked her 
first question. “Where are we go- 
ing?” 

1 told her and she thought it 
over. She nodded, put her hand on 
mine for a minute. 

Unamusing thoughts came to 
my mind, but I was detached from 
them, as if they didn’t belong to 
me. How long would the North 
American power grid work? The

power plants were more or less au- 
tonomous — but when the first 
something went wrong The Com- 
puter wouldn’t be there to help 
them. 

“We've been on the Big C for 
just over a hundred years," I said, 
more to myself than to Alice. 

“What?” 

“I was just wondering. Will we 
go back to the Stone Age, or 
what?” 

“Don’t be silly.” 

“I’m not.” I looked at the chron- 
ometer and turned on the screen. A 
holofilm, fifty years old, by the 
look of it. “You brought the 
drinks?” 

“Yes, Harry.” 

“Pour us each one, will you? 
Now.” 

She did and handed me a glass. 1 
put it on the floor beside me, 
looked at the screen again. An 
unfamiliar station, we were over 
St. Louis. The lights looked nice 
from up here. 

Strange, 1 thought. I do this for 
billions of people and for the whole 
of them (I tried not to think of the 
ones I was doing in), but I do it as 
much for the hundred and ten 
pounds of my Alice sitting here at 
my side as I do for all the rest. 
Even including grandpappy. 

Now a flustered face on the 
screen. 

“We interrupt our program,” he 
said and swallowed. 

The transmitters are still going, I 
thought. The newscaster didn’t be- 



lieve what he was trying to say. 

“This is Howard Kalb, KLOC, 
Denver.” I was surprised Denver 
was still on, so close to Colorado 
Springs. “There has been a 
tremendous explosion, probably 
nuclear, in Colorado Springs, with-

I repeat, all Computer functions 
have ceased. There is reason to be- 
lieve that similar explosions have 
occurred in the Soviet Republic 
and in China.” I’d even got that 
part of it right. “The public is

I flicked it off, picked up my 
drink from the floor and looked in- 
to the eyes of my wife. We clinked 
glasses. 

“To — whatever it is,” I said. 

“Yes.” Alice’s face was hard to 
read. She was weeping quietly, but 
1 didn’t know the context. One tear 
is much like another. 

“The power will go,” I said. 

“When?” 

“An hour, a week, who knows? I 
just thought I’d mention it. I don’t 
want you to worry if all the lights 
go off down there.’’ She looked 
down. “If all the power is gone by 
the time we get to Keene we’ll fly 
around until dawn and go down on 
manual. No problem. I just didn’t 
want you to worry,” I said. 

“All right.” 

The night was like a diamond, 
and the lights below were like stars. 
They stayed on almost all the way 
to Keene. ★

THE EXCORCI

He had to destroy the life she had 
chosen — to achieve a life of his own!

I T WAS only when Harvey start- 
ed to take Myra apart that the 
pain began to go away. Partly his 
purpose was to free himself of her 
hurt, but he was also fascinated. 
He marveled at the intricate inter- 
play which gave her variety, at the 
smooth chaining and merging of 
seductive tricks and gestures — the 
careful posing of the classic pro- 
file; the graceful gesture of the 
perfect arm; the calculated display 
of the slender, high-arched foot; 
the gracefully careless bending 
over which, as if by chance, re- 
vealed the perfect breasts; the 
greater provocation of her body 
glimpsed through transparent 
gown; the deliberate lifting of the 
gown. 

Myra’s program — when he had 
solved it — was a marvel of subrou- 
tines, macroinstructions and geo- 
metrical interpolations, carefully 
keyed to his movements and reac- 
tions, to the monitoring of his 
bodily functions (he hadn’t expect- 
ed that) and to words and phrases 
he uttered and some simple rela- 
tions between them. He hadn’t 
realized how little what he had 
said had mattered in any immedi- 
ate sense. 

What had mattered was that he 
had chosen these particular pro- 
grams. Or, rather, that he had 
chosen this particular simulation, 
taking her for a real woman. 
Through the Filmy screen of his 
communication booth, he had 
seen her, chosen her, admired her. 



talked to her, touched her and lain 
with her. The Myra program — and 
the adaptive features that he had 
evoked from it — had been his dar- 
ling, his Myra. Myra the beautiful, 
Myra the enticing, Myra the gen- 
tle, Myra the teasing, Myra the 
submissive. 

He now knew that there were 
other Myras. There were, in fact, 
5,346 subscribers to this time-shar- 
ing Myra processor. He speculated 
(so desirable was Myra), that 
there had to be hundreds or thou- 
sands of identical processors in the 
world, all giving a Myra to some- 
one who wanted her and believed 
her to be real. Each subscriber 
found Myra a little different. Each 
subscriber’s Myra changed as the 
user changed with mood and time. 

Harvey had been shocked to 
Find what some men required of 
Myra. He was gratiFied to find 
that there were limits to her com- 
pliance, that is, to the flexibility of 
her program. Those who went out 
of her scope, physically or intel- 
lectually, were artfully shifted to 
“friends” and became users of Sal, 
Ann, Jezebel or Hypatia or some 
other program. They congratu- 
lated themselves that they now had 
the sole love, affection, friendship, 
submission or services of the one 
woman in the world who was real- 
ly suited to them. In a sense, they 
had. 

As Harvey worked his way 
through Myra’s flow charts and 
listings he saw what made her work. 



82 



GALAXY 




In his heart, in his recollections, 
Myra was not there. With his eyes 
closed, he could see his Myra 
looking artlessly at him. He could 
summon up a thousand glimpses 
of her body. He could feel it un- 
der his hands or against him. It 
must be like the recollection of a 
dear dead love, he thought. But 
Myra was not dead. He could have 
again what he had had before. If 
he keyed her number on the com- 
municator she would be there. But 
it would not be the same. He had 
not called Myra since the night 
when he had divined what she was. 

The initial numbing despair of 
that day passed, to be followed by 
mechanical apathy. He ate me- 
chanically. Sleep did not come na- 
turally; he lay quietly with idle 
thoughts until he induced sleep 
electronically. On three evenings 
he called his grave, fatherly, illu- 
sory friend, Donald, whom he had 
found to be a simulation. He 
watched the illusion of the room, 
the fire, the black cocker spaniel. 
Smoky. He could admire Donald 
abstractly as a work of art. He 
played chess with him, finding him, 
as always, an opponent difficult 
but not impossible to master. Har- 
vey won about three out of five 
games. He supposed that this had 
been the comfortable edge he had 
needed. 

Donald was a work of art and a 
fine one. Myra was no doubt a 
work of art. Harvey had not been 
able to look on her as one. He 



could not bring himself to call her 
— to use her — knowing what she 
was. To him, this was at once rea- 
sonable and unreasonable. He was 
intelligent enough to know that he 
had a problem. Problems called 
for solutions. In dissecting Myra’s 
program he was probing toward a 
solution. 

H arvey thought of the day of 
frantic action following his dis- 
covery that Donald and Myra were 
simulations. He skipped breakfast 
that morning. He skipped the 
fresher. At the earliest reasonable 
hour he stepped into the transpor- 
tation cubicle in his apartment and 
quickly emerged from the termin- 
al in his anachronistic office, his 
office with a wooden desk and 
bookshelves with real books. He 
sat down before the very non-ana- 
chronistic console. 

Why had he not used the con- 
sole at home? He knew the answer. 
In his apartment he was a failure. 
He had chosen as a friend and as a 
mistress two illusions, not two real 
people. In his office he was still 
master, still successful. He had 
been successful in unraveling some 
threads of a past which had been 
almost totally tangled in an over- 
whelming bulk of computerized 
records. It was his discovery and 
understanding of early nonsense 
about “artificial intelligence” that 
had caused him to doubt Donald 
and Myra. His relation to others 
and to the world, might be a sham- 



THE EXORCISM

bles, but his skills were sure and 
his intelligence keen. 

Harvey hesitated before the con- 
sole. He felt that he must speak to 
a human being — but to whom? In 
the years since Jie had established 
his office here in the library, send- 
ing machines burrowing for hidden 
books and records of the past, he 
had had no need to consult anyone 
else or to see anyone else. Ma- 
chines had done what he had bid- 
den them to do. But surely there 
must be some responsible person 
to whom he could talk. 

He keyed ORGANIZATION 
CHART, wondering what would 
happen. In response the screen dis- 
played a dictionary definition, fol- 
lowed by columns of detailed sub- 
headings. Clearly he was on the 
wrong track. 

I HAVE A COMPLAINT, he 
keyed. The screen displayed a list 
of eighty-seven books with that ti- 
tle, fifty-seven in the files and the 
others conjectured from passing 
references in man's literature. 

Suddenly light dawned. Through 
long habit he was in the library’s 
files, not on the public communi- 
cation channels. He keyed the 
change and then wondered what 
to do next. It was useless to call 
the illusions of Donald or Myra. 
An old-fashioned word occurred 
to hhn and he keyed DIRECTO- 
RY. The screen responded with a 
huge, indented list of headings and 
subheadings. He scanned them 
with impatience. Nothing seemed 



right. Perhaps he should start at 
home. 

He keyed LIBRARY and faced 
another long list. In this he finally 
located the library in which he was 
sitting. He keyed the number. A 
pretty, blank-faced girl stared out 
of the screen, obviously a simula- 
tion. 

“I am the National Historical 
Library,” the simulation said. 
“Please state your business.” 

“I want to talk to the librarian,” 
he told her. 

“There is no librarian,” the sim- 
ulation responded. “I am the Na- 
tional Historical Library. Please 
state your business.” 

“I want to talk to a human be- 
ing. A human being in the li- 
brary,” he demanded. 

“There is one human being in 
the library,” the simulation said. 
“I will connect you.” 

A new image flashed on the 
screen. He found that he was star- 
ing at himself and broke the con- 
nection. 

A sort of desperation seized 
Harvey, but his mind continued to 
function smoothly. He went back 
to the directory and studied it in- 
tently. Within a quarter of an hour 
he felt that he was on the track. 
Fifteen minutes later he had ar- 
rived. 

His screen showed a man of in- 
determinate age, surely not old 
and certainly not young. The man 
had a squarish face of a healthy 
brown and bushy eyebrows but no

hair. He sat, or lounged, behind an 
empty desk, a keyboard before 
him. 

“I’m Harvey Adam, Eight-sev- 
en-two, seven-four-five-three,’’ 
Harvey stated. 

“Yes, so I see," the man re- 
plied, apparently looking at a part 
of the communication screen to 
the left of the image of Harvey. 
“A good programer, I see. Found 
books and microfiche in the li- 
brary. Found a real track in the 
records. Might be interesting.” 

“But that isn’t — ’’ Harvey start- 
ed to say. 

“No,” the man continued. 
“You broke out.” 

“Broke out?” Harvey asked. 

“Found that the friends you had 
chosen were simulations. Can’t 
put up with it. Want real people 
again.” 

That was it, Harvey thought. 
He wanted a real people again. In 
the years of his childhood and 
youth he had had to associate with 
the real people of his peer group. 
When he had been asked to father 
children, the mothers had been 
chosen for him. He had found peo- 
ple difficult and computers coop- 
erative. People had adapted to his 
needs only partially and under per- 
suasion or coercion. When, as an 
adult, he had chosen, he had un- 
knowingly preferred computer sim- 
ulations to real people. He had 
chosen the selfless, adaptable com- 
puter simulations, indistinguishable 
from life — and so much “better.” 



“Yes,” Harvey said. “1 want 
real people. But will they want 
me?” 

“Depends,” the man said. 
“You’re good-looking. You’re 
pretty smart. You ought to be 
able to beat out a computer. Look 
here — record this.” 

Harvey pushed the RECORD 
button. “What is it?” he asked. 

“It’s all identified,” the man 
said. “But since you want to 
know, you’re recording descrip- 
tions and access codes for all the 
simulations — for their programs, 
I mean. And name-numbers and 
access to files for all young male 
and female adults within a hun- 
dred miles — that is, for all those 
who haven’t broken out. And ob- 
servation numbers.” 

“What are those?” Harvey 
asked. 

“Observation numbers will per- 
mit you to observe individuals 
while they work. And all the calls 
they make from their apart- 
ments,” the man added. “That 
ought to be a help.” 

Harvey thought that it would. 

“But my work?” Harvey asked. 

“That’s up to you,” the man 
answered. 

“Shall I report — ” Harvey 
started. 

“You’re on your own now,” the 
man said. “Everybody is, but some 
don’t know it. Don’t bother me; 
I’m busy.” 

“But,” Harvey said, “are you a 
man or a simulation?” 



THE EXORCISM

“Does it matter?” the man re- 
plied, reaching forward to key a 
button. He disappeared. 

A WAVE of reUef swept over 
Harvey as he digested what the 
man had said. He reached for the 
keyboard to examine the infor- 
mation he had been given. But no, 
he thought. He had had enough for 
the day. He entered his transporta- 
tion booth and emerged at the 
Athletic Club. He had been too 
distraught to go there since he had 
found that Myra and Donald were 
simulations. He put on his sports 
suit and, going into the room 
marked SURFING, plugged in 
the cords and lowered the goggles. 

Harvey found himself lying on a 
surfboard which floated on the 
clear, warm water off the north 
shore of Oahu, a huge roller ris- 
ing behind him. He paddled fran- 
tically with his hands, then rose to 
his feet and slid forward at a diz- 
zying pace. He turned the board 
away from the breaking crest and 
slid along half again as fast as the 
wave moved forward, keeping just 
ahead of the crest. He stayed 
ahead of the crest until the wave 
had almost spent itself. He en- 
joyed the buffeting of the foam. A 
phantom in an outgoing boat 
threw him a line and towed him 
out where he waited for another 
roller. 

When Harvey tired of surfing 
he raised the goggles, pulled out 
the plugs and went to an adjacent 



booth, where he sailed quietly for 
an hour on the waters of the Ae- 
gean in a beamy, two-ended boat. 
The rock that made the isle of Hy- 
dra was bright in the sun to his 
right. Today he sailed alone, with 
no desire for competition. Only to 
experience the simulated sun, the 
simulated wind, the simulated slap 
of the waves. And the simulated 
sea. The dragon green, the lumi- 
nous, the dark, the serpent-haunt- 
ed sea, Harvey thought. The snow- 
besprinkled wine of earth; the 
white and blue, flower-foaming 
sea. 

But as he rested he thought of 
Myra. The desperation was gone 
but the ache was not. Simulation 
that Myra was, she was real in his 
heart. Harvey unplugged from the 
Aegean and spent the rest of the 
day in simulated skiing in Ameri- 
ca, Austria and the Andes. Skiing 
left little time for thought. Ex- 
hausted at last, he went to his 
apartment late, ate, went to bed 
and induced sleep electronically. 

T he next morning Harvey tack- 
led his new information. He had 
reflected concerning his most im- 
mediate needs. As a start he sorted 
all the young adult females for 
what he thought might be common 
interests or compatibility. He 
came up with 2,742 and he didn’t 
know how to narrow things down. 
He started looking at pictures, but 
his mind was preoccupied. Some- 
thing seemed wrong. He wasn’t 



86

looking for a book in the library. 
What should he do? 

Finally he started in numerical 
order, an unseen watcher in of- 
fices, studios, laboratories, shops 
and hospitals. Sometimes he knew 
immediately that some particular 
scene was not for him and keyed 
the next number. Sometimes he 
paused for a minute — or five or 
ten. There was the way the young 
adult female looked. None was so 
beautiful as Myra, of course. And 
there was the way she moved. 
None was as graceful as Myra. 
There was the air of concentration, 
competence or don't care with 
which she did things. Sometimes, 
after ten minutes, he pressed the 
key that added the girl to the list 
on his home communicator. 

It was surprising how fast time 
passed and how pleasantly. By five 
in the afternoon most of the girls 
had left for sports. He could not 
see them during simulated sports, 
so he set the computer to add the 
names of their sports to the list at 
home. Then he went skiing at sim- 
ulated Alta. 

Harvey enjoyed his sport. But 
dinner gave him time for thought. 
While he was eating he reflected 
on his approach and found it good. 
When he had finished he sat down 
at his communicator and started 
on the list. 

The first girl, a brunette patho- 
logist named Wanda, had not yet 
finished eating, so he passed on to 
the next. 



Plain Jane was playing bridge 
with three simulations which she 
believed to be real young females. 
That told him little, so he went on 
to a demure artist named Sue. 

Sue surprised him. She was 
talking to a hairy brute, more 
muscular than handsome. The 
brute conversed in monosyllables 
and these suggested some collo- 
quialism belonging to another age. 
As a historian, Harvey was at a 
loss to place the dialect. But, he 
reflected, he’s just a simulation. 
The brute spoke that way because 
some people liked that sort of 
thing. 

A moment soon came when the 
brute’s pants dropped and Harvey 
found what young females like 
Sue really wanted. He had never 
measured life in quite those di- 
mensions. / can't compete with 
that, Harvey thought and went on 
to Rita, a buxom brunette. 

At first Harvey didn’t know 
what to make of the scene that 
Rita’s communicator showed, but 
presently the tangle on the rug re- 
solved itself into two young fe- 
males. One raised her head and ad- 
dressed Rita. 

“Hi,” she said. “Come on in.” 
“I’ll watch a while,” Rita said. 
“There’s plenty of time.” 

“Okay,” said the other. “We’re 
Just getting warmed up.” 

Despite the fact that Rita could 
be nothing to him, Harvey watched 
for a while in fascination. Of 
course, as a historian he knew 



THE EXORCISM 



87 




about these matters intellectually. 
It was different to watch them hap- 
pening in what seemed to be the 
flesh. Harvey was rather excited 
by the time he recollected his pur- 
pose and moved on down the list. 

By the end ot the evening, he 
had found one distinct possibility. 
Maggie was a lively redhead. She 
liked to ski. That might be a bond, 
he reflected. Could two real peo- 
ple ski together in simulation? He 
might be able to program it. No 
one understood computers or sim- 
ulation better than he did. It might 
be companionable to ski together. 
But the bother of skiing together 
on inferior real slopes would scarce- 
ly be worth while. 

Maggie’s lover, Ralph, was 
handsome. Harvey thought him no 
handsomer than himself. Ralph 
had about Harvey’s build. But 
Ralph was listless and awkward. 
While he was agreeable enough, 
he didn’t seem too bright. How 
could a girl like Maggie have 
chosen him? Harvey supposed that 
she had been looking for certain 
things and had found them in 
Ralph. Then she hadn’t looked 
further. She didn't find me, Har- 
vey thought. But then, I am real 
and she was searching among sim- 
ulations. Now. what can / do about 
Ralph? 

A few alterations in the pro- 
gram and Ralph’s shallow agree- 
ableness would become painful 
obtuseness. Harvey could even 
program Ralph to be out or busy 



on some occasions. This was no 
doubt unprecedented in simula- 
tions. Donald had always been at 
Harvey’s call. And Myra — 

T he loss of Myra as a person 
still hurt Harvey. Savagely he 
turned his attention toward Ralph. 
A touch of impotence should help 
to cool Maggie’s feelings toward 
her simulated lover. And that 
should leave an opening for a real 
person: himself. 

Harvey was not in a bad mood 
as he tried to sleep that night, but 
he was far from serene. His brain 
seethed with the technical details of 
what lay ahead. His body, aroused 
by an evening of evesdropping, 
seethed with sex. Really, shouldn’t 
I call Myra? But that thought was 
too painful. He induced sleep 
electronically instead. Before he 
awoke Myra came to him in a 
dream, a shadow of a shadow, and 
temporarily relieved him of one 
preoccupation. 

For the next week Harvey 
worked on Ralph. Despite his 
thorough knowledge of simula- 
tion, it took him several days to 
understand Ralph’s program well 
enough to alter it and to make 
sure that the alterations would ap- 
ply for Maggie alone. It would be 
cruel to spoil the fun of the other 
2,740 subscribers whom this Ralph 
processor served. 

As he gained confidence, Har- 
vey made the alterations he had 
planned. Ralph became obtuse. A 



88 



GALAXY 




little step at a time, he became 
inconsiderate. More and more of- 
ten he was out when Maggie 
called. For a few evenings Harvey 
observed the effect via Maggie’s 
communicator. Satisfied that his 
programing worked, he stopped 
his observations. He found it dis- 
turbing and degrading to spy on 
another’s sex life. Especially on 
the sex life of Maggie, whom he 
planned to have for himself. 

Day by day Harvey thought out 
and made the planned alterations 
in Ralph’s program and Ralph 
became progressively less and less 
accessible. Harvey skied a great 
deal after work, often two or three 
hours instead of one. On a few 
evenings he played chess with Don- 
ald, but he found this unsatisfac- 
tory. It’s strange, he thought. 
Donald behaves exactly as before. 
Then I enjoyed playing chess; now 
I don’t. It’s what goes on in my 
mind that makes the difference, I. 
suppose. 

During a few evenings Harvey’s 
thoughts turned to Myra and his 
plans for her. The effect was dis- 
turbing. To distract himself he 
planned his encounter with Mag- 
gie. There was a certain relish in 
that. But the actuality, of course, 
had to wait until the alterations he 
had made in Ralph had had effect. 
And until he was through with 
Myra. 

So, when he had added the last 
touch, the debilitating touch, to 
Ralph’s program, he started on 



Myra’s. His touch was sure now, 
but he proceeded with loving care, 
subroutine by subroutine, macro 
by macro and, when necessary, 
instruction by instruction. How 
marvelous a thing Myra was, he 
thought as he took her apart. 
Cleverly chained together, keyed 
to inputs he himself had supplied, 
were the host of ingenious coque- 
tries, the wealth of clever devices. 
These had been activated by a 
rough analysis of what he had 
said and by a variety of physiologi- 
cal inputs which his communicator 
— and those of other subscribers — 
had inputted to the Myra program. 

No wonder Myra had respond- 
ed accurately as well as artfully to 
his moods and words. When he 
had known Myra as a woman he 
had never known her so well. Then 
such knowledge might have spoiled 
things, Harvey realized. Now he 
wanted to know, despite all the 
fond sadness that knowing and re- 
calling brought him. 

At last his reprograming was 
complete. The plans for his en- 
counter with Maggie were com- 
plete, too. But he must see Myra 
once more before putting them in 
effect. 



O N THE evening of that day he 
sailed serenely on the beautiful 
Aegean, Hydra gleaming to his 
right. Satisfied and relaxed, he ate 
a leisurely meal. He enjoyed eat- 
ing more than he had since his 



THE EXORCISM

catastrophic realization that Don- 
ald and Myra, his carefully chosen 
friends, were not real people. 
Then, settling down comfortably 
before his communicator, Harvey 
keyed Myra’s number. 

There was a pang in Harvey’s 
heart as he saw Myra again. She 
was seated in a familiar posture, 
looking at herself in the mirror of 
her dressing table. Her perfect fea- 
tures, relieved from severity by 
their slight rounding, were as 
breathtaking as ever. Her neck, 
arms and body had their accus- 
tomed grace. But for once the 
dressing table was not littered. Ev- 
erything had been tidied in an un- 
accustomed, make-work sort of 
way. 

And tonight Myra was not 
dressed in a guazy, revealing gown. 
Tonight she wore a beautiful bro- 
cade jacket and slacks of a soft 
but opaque material. These en- 
hanced her beauty, but they did not 
reveal her body. And tonight Myra 
was frowning into the mirror with 
an expression that seemed to hold 
more determination than perplex- 
ity. 

As she heard the signal Myra 
turned toward Harvey. 

“I was going to call you, Har- 
vey,” she said. 

Her expression was fond but 
firm. Harvey knew that it betok- 
ened something different in their 
relationship. 

“I hope nothing’s wrong, dear,” 
Harvey said with serious concern. 



Myra looked sad. 

“It’s more than something, 
Harvey. It’s everything.” 

“But we’ve always had such 
fun,” Harvey said eagerly. 

“Fun. I suppose so, dear. But it 
doesn’t get us anywhere,” Myra 
replied softly but seriously. “It’s 
no use.” 

“Why should it get us some- 
where?” Harvey asked. “Isn’t 
where we are good enough?” 

“No, it isn’t, Harvey. For chil- 
dren, maybe, but not for grown- 
up people.” 

The idea of the lovely Myra as 
a serious, grown-up person 
amused Harvey. But, he reflected, 
all things can change. He didn’t 
know exactly what to say, but af- 
ter a moment Myra continued. 

“There’s your work,” she said. 
“I never have understood it.” 

“It’s very complex,” Harvey 
replied. “Sometimes it’s exasper- 
ating. I come to you to get away 
from it.” 

“But you talk to Donald about 
your work,” Myra objected. 

That was a hit, Harvey thought. 
“Loving isn’t just — sex, Har- 
vey,” Myra went on. “Loving 
should be — sharing.” 

“What should I share with you 
that I don’t, Myra?” 

“That’s just it, Harvey,” Myra 
said stubbornly. “It’s what you 
think of me that counts.” She 
looked at him determinedly but 
her lips quivered and she seemed 
near tears. “I’m not going to see

you any more, Harvey — and I 
mean it.” 

Harvey was full of a mixture of 
emotions which seemed quite de- 
tached from his understanding of 
the situation. Finally he spoke. 

“If that’s what you want, My- 
ra,” he assented, sadly and kindly. 

“See?” Myra said, almost an- 
grily. 

“Isn’t that what you wanted me 
to say?” Harvey asked. 

Myra became a little calmer. 

“1 suppose it isn’t, Harvey,” she 
said. “I suppose 1 wanted you to 
say that none of what I’ve been 
saying is true. None of it.” 

There was another pause. Fi- 
nally Myra spoke again. Now she 
seemed serene. The step had been 
taken. The pain had been felt. All 
of that was past. 

“Don’t regret anything, Har- 
vey,” Myra told him. “It was 
good. It was beautiful. But it’s 
over now. And remember. I’ll al- 
ways think kindly of you, Har- 
vey. You were good to me. You 
were good for me. But now we 
both need something else.” 

“You were good for me, My- 



ra,” Harvey said fondly. “And 
I’ll always love you — ” 

“You’ll love my memory,” My- 
ra told him. “And you should, 
dear. But you’ll love somebody 
else.” 

Myra looked at him calmly, 
with a sort of secret joy and sad- 
ness showing through, he thought. 
Then she reached toward the key 
of her communicator and her im- 
age was gone. 

The old Myra had been exor- 
cised. The sweet cheat was gone. 
For Harvey a humiliating and ex- 
asperating experience had been re- 
placed by a fond memory, sweetly 
with him as he dozed into peaceful 
sleep, thinking thoughts of the 
morrow and of Maggie. 

And all that went as planned. 
Harvey had his morrow and his 
Maggie. Maggie took him on the 
rebound from the unpleasant ex- 
perience he had engineered for her. 
But Maggie was only a beginning 
in Harvey’s education in real peo- 
ple and the real world. For Mag- 
gie had chosen her Ralph well. 
She was a strong woman who liked 
weak men. ★

DUNCAN LUNAN 



LIAISON 
ASSIGNMENT

E arth had been a member of 
the interstellar Interface civili- 
zation for nearly six months. The 
people mainly responsible for this 
situation gathered one morning for 
coffee — with the RLV astronauts 
McKay, Slazeck and Devlin were 
Lang, Extraterrestrial Advisor to 
the U.N. Committee for Earth’s 
Defense, and his assistant Cathy, 
Cathy Devlin-to-be. They sat in 
Lang’s office at the Montana 
spacefield and McKay was 
holding forth on the subject of the 
committee. 

“Ten years ago we were at- 
tacked from space. Massive, re- 
peated attacks on the cities, chaos 
everywhere — you all know what 
happened. Acting military govern- 
ments, some of them still acting. 
And as far as we knew then, when 
the raids stopped the respite was 
only temporary.’’ He noted the 
range of expressions across the 
group. In those days Cathy had 
been a schoolgirl, horrified but 
untouched by civilization’s 
nightmares. Devlin was a student 
taking flying lessons in his spare 
time, undecided, till then, about a 
military career. Slazeck, already 
a fighter pilot, had attacked a 
raiding ship, destroying two of its 
robot interceptors before he was 
shot down. McKay himself had 
been with NASA several years 
and had had no crack at the enemy. 
Lang, the only man to survive 



direct contact with the attackers, 
had lost wife, family, career 
and — worst of all — memory. His 
experiences in the hands of the 
aliens, the extraterrestrial ad- 
vice that might really have been 
useful, had all been erased. 

“So space research became a 
military endeavor,’’ McKay went 
on. “The space program, when it 
started up again, was preparing for 
the next series of attacks. As it 
turned out, our objective was far 
too narrow. When the Interface 
contact arose and presented an 
altogether new situation, the 
committee failed to adjust to it. 
The Furtherance, the survey 
teams of the Interface, have been 
forced to work with us as individ- 
uals. Here we are, the Earth plane- 
tary agent and his group, with one 
gifted spaceship our only access 
to the Interface — and that’s only a 
Recovery and Liaison Vehicle, a 
rescue ship. All Earth’s cultural 
reps are gathered in this room right 
now, still advisers to a vast mili- 
tary organization we no longer 
need. Whoever the raiders were, 
we can call up help from the Inter- 
face if they reappear — but I think 
they made one assault here before 
the Furtherance opened up this 
part of the Galactic spiral, then 
moved on. They’ve gone back into 
the dark where they belong.” 

“So you feel ET affairs aren’t 
for the military staff committee,” 
said Lang. “Whose hat do we put 
on, then? UNESCO’s?” 



94 



GALAXY 




“Might well be,” said McKay. 
“Whoever the hat belonged to, un- 
der it should be an organization for 
trade and cultural links with the 
member races of the Interface — as 
many of them as possible — before 
any one of them can claim the 
Solar System for development. 
We know far too little about the 
Interface, yet we know enough to 
realize our problems aren’t mili- 
tary ones.” 

“The argument’s good,” said 
Lang, “but the committee won’t 
agree. For cultural interchange we 
first need ships — and all space- 
craft design and manufacture are 
under military control.” 

“Don’t I know it? They’ve op- 
posed building a moonbase be- 
cause they’d still have to use Sat- 
urns to supply it.” 

Slazeck was going to comment, 
but the phone rang beside him. 
“It’s for you, Mac.” 

“A Furtherance ship has just 
come into orbit, sir,” the control 
tower told McKay. “Mr. Kiliath is 
aboard and wishes to speak to 
you.” 

“Okay, I’ll raise him from 
here.” McKay took out his pock- 
et communicator and plugged in 
to the perception circuits of the 
RLV, out across the field. “Ac- 
knowledge.” 

Without leaving the office, he 
was “in orbit” far above the Earth, 
in the security of the massive Fur- 
therance starship. The others, with 
badge relays, could only hear what 



went on. “Greetings, friend 
McKay,’’ said the computer- 
translation voice. “We do not seek 
rescue, so I thought to save you a 
direct contact.” 

“I appreciate that,” said 
McKay. The communications 
relay embedded in his skull had a 
kick like a mule. “What can we do 
for you?” 

“I would be grateful for your as- 
sistance,” the computer-transla- 
tion began, “on a new member 
planet of the Interface, named 
Sarran — ” 

T he RLV came out of Interface 
at twenty thousand feet and at 
once McKay began to read mean- 
ing into the neutral words of the 
translation. The planet was indeed 
very old; from this altitude no life 
showed, only an endless vista of 
bare, eroded hills. As if the Inter- 
face, a half-mile disc linking 
Earth’s sky to Serann’s, had 
opened instead on a far reach of 
time. 

Almost at once McKay was un- 
easy. Already the assignment had 
diverged from expectation; when 
Kiliath had spoken of an old 
planet, freshly reached by the 
Furtherance teams, he had not 
conveyed the impression of this 
bleakness. No doubt there were 
more surprises to come. 

This was to be a cultural mis- 
sion — Sarran was inhabited by a 
race named the Jarra, the rem- 
nants, said Kiliath, of a once- 



LIAISON ASSIGNMENT 



95 




great civilization. The mission 
was to assess how the Jarra might 
be assimilated into the Inter- 
face, if they wished to be. At last a 
liaison assignment for McKay’s 
Recovery and Liaison Vehicle, 
something to reinforce the point 
he had been making to Lang. Now, 
looking at the hostile landscape 
of Sarran, he wondered if the 
demonstration would backfire. 
All his misgivings about his having 
brought Cathy along also re- 
turned. He did not doubt her com- 
petence, he had explained — vyhen 
the Furtherance teams had 
reached Earth she had been their 
first contact. But the RLV’s two 
interstellar missions to date had 
turned thoroughly hairy and he 
had no wish for a girl’s company on 
another 

“That great Furtherance dread- 
nought will be there to protect 
me,’’ she had replied. 

Cathy was determined to share 
the new ET contact, especially af- 
ter Kiliath described them. “What 
are the Jarra?” McKay had asked 
and the computer translation had 
replied, “Birdpeople.” 

“This I must see,” she had en- 
thused after Kiliath’s ship had 
gone. “What can they be — slender, 
with fragile wings, or soaring 
feathered monarchs?” 

“That computer can be 
thoroughly misleading,” McKay 
pointed out. “Kiliath may only 
have said they keep birds.” 

“Oh, wonderful! Hunting with 



great hawks, as big as eagles?” 
McKay was afraid she would be 
disappointed. Now as he flew over 
Sarann, only minutes after their 
takeoff from the Montana field, he 
wondered if disappointment could 
be the right word. The intelligence 
that could survive here while the 
planet aged should be met with 
caution, if not apprehension. 

The RLV’s search devices pin- 
pointed Kiliath’s touchdown al- 
most at once. McKay lost altitude 
till they were circling it; an old 
castle on top of a crag, weathered 
so that it merged into the rock. 
Beside it on the flat top of the crag 
was McKay’s second shock; not 
the huge Furtherance ship which 
had paused in Earth orbit, but a 
stub-winged shuttle that must have 
been carried aboard. Though he 
had smiled at the idea of a warship 
to protect Cathy, he himself felt 
suddenly committed much farther 
out in the unknown. 

He brought the RLV down on 
VTOL thrust, folding back the 
variable wings into delta configu- 
ration as the landing blocks went 
down. He expected clouds of dust, 
but the winds had swept this spot 
clean. The jets stopped and the 
ship settled on its pads. 

T WO by two they went through 
the airlock. Kiliath had assured 
them no precautions need be taken 
about bacteria; and Kiliath himself 
was coming from the castle to greet 
them. The humanoid Fallaran, Kil- 



96 



GALAXY 




iath’s race, came from a high-grav- 
ity planet: about four feet tall, mas- 
sively built, they had thick gray 
skin and brilliant eyes. To date 
Kiliath had been the individual best 
known to the RLV team. 

“I see now why you asked for the 
RLV,” said McKay as they were 
strolling towards the entry. “But 
where is your own ship?” 

“The ship which I second-com- 
manded was lost near your Moon,” 
Kiliath reminded him. “On the 
ship which brought us here 1 was a 
passenger only.” 

“But surely a Furtherance mis- 
sion of this importance rates a 
starship?” 

“No need exists now for great 
fleets in this sector,” Kiliath re- 
plied. “Almost all are gone to other 
duties.” 

“I see,” said McKay, but his 
tone of voice would be lost in trans- 
lation. Kiliath’s words explained 
why no starships had been avail- 
able on the RLV’s last rescue mis- 
sion; they altered the whole per- 
spective of McKay’s own partial 
membership in the Furtherance. 
The revelation needed a great 
deal of thought — and at that 
moment when he was least pre- 
pared, McKay came face to face 
with the first of the Jarra. 

It wasn’t, he thought wildly after 
his heart started beating again, that 
the Jarra reminded him of any- 
thing frightful from Earth’s cul- 
tural background. A succession of 
possibilities like ghost, vampire. 



demon had flashed across his 
mind and been discarded. The 
Jarra was tall, nearly seven feet 
tall, and dressed in black: a thin 
garment held by what seemed to be 
great shell-cases hinged at the col- 
lar-bone. The shoulders flexed 
briefly, lifting impossibly high for 
human bones; McKay realized 
that the Jarra’s skeleton had two 
stable configurations, one for 
standing upright and the other for 
horizontal flight. The skin was 
deathly white, as were the curls of 
hair above the tall forehead — and 
the face was a nightmare. If you 
stretched a nylon stocking over a 
human head and made a carving 
of the result, McKay thought, you 
might reach an approximation. 

He hoped the Jarra couldn’t read 
the shock on his face. What effect 
the alien had on the others, he 
hadn’t noticed; McKay was still in 
a daze as the party moved through 
stone corridors to the castle hall. 
He must be getting too old for this 
game, he thought bitterly. Every 
time his eye fell on one of the Jarra 
during the meal that was served to 
them, the same pang of revulsion 
shot through him. 

They were proud and indepen- 
dent — and suspicious of the strang- 
ers — he realized as Kiliath nego- 
tiated with them. They had sur- 
vived a history far longer than 
Earth’s and knew their capabili- 
ties. These were the aristoc- 
racy — from castles far across the 
land — what could you call them. 



LIAISON ASSIGNMENT 



97 




lords, dukes, chieftains? All of 
these and none of them, for every 
title had unwanted terrestrial as- 
sociations. Each Jarra chief his 
castle and his own people in it. 
This was Castle^Carraine. Two 
miles down the valley, on the other 
side, was Bira, its close ally — and 
what, if anything, would the Inter- 
face do for them? They had no 
ships, little technology — their 
problem was Earth’s, McKay 
realized, on a greater scale. 

At least, he thought, when he 
and his crew returned to the ship 
at nightfall, his hosts didn't have a 
Committee for Sarann Defense 
to obscure issues. 

N ext morning McKay split his 
gang, set them about the tasks 
of the mission. Slazeck and Devlin 
went out with the Furtherance 
team to assess the remaining 
resources of the ancient planet; 
Lang and McKay took the REV up 
into space, to take an Interface 
relay out to Sarann’s large moon. 
Cathy stayed behind to begin her 
study of the Jarra race and its his- 
tory. If she was frightened of the 
aloof birdmen she gave no sign: she 
might have been starting a social 
survey in the ordinary small 
American town. So far, McKay 
had to admit, the girl was shaping 
up better than he was. 

The moon was a hundred thou- 
sand miles out, well beyond the 
ten-thousand-mile range of the 
standard Interface satellite, so a 



rocket flight was needed to place a 
relay in orbit round it. Still they 
could use the first relay to save 
time and fuel. Climbing away 
from the castle, McKay said, “Up 
Interface — ’’ to the computer- 
autopilot and a black circle 
opened in the sky ahead of them. 
When the RLV came out on the 
other side it was already ten thou- 
sand miles out and on trajectory 
for the moon at four miles a sec- 
ond above escape velocity. De- 
celeration into lunar orbit would 
involve a velocity change of about 
five miles a second out of the 
twelve mps the RLV could achieve 
from full tanks and the return 
trip — once the relay had been 
placed — would use up no fuel at all. 

How long had it been since this 
trip had last been made — if ever it 
had been? The mission still had to 
establish whether the Jarra had 
ever had space travel even to the 
extent of reaching their moon. 

Lang, McKay found, shared his 
reaction to the Jarra, though ap- 
parently to a lesser extent. The 
man must have worse terrors 
locked within his own mind, after 
all. But McKay had been playing 
down his own feelings — he was 
downright glad to be off the planet 
again and ashamed of it. 

II 

C ONVERSATION with the Jar- 
ra was a little difficult that 
morning. With the RLV out in 



98 



GALAXY 




space, Cathy was using the 
shuttle's computer for translation; 
and frequently in the course of 
Devlin's mineral survey the 
mountains got between them. 
When the Interface satellite was 
overhead there was no break in 
communication but at other 
times she found the translation 
voice would fade away without 
warning, leaving the Jarra 
mouthing his own harsh syllables 
into the microphone. Heraxt, the 
Furtherance officer Kiliath had 
left with her, could only wave his 
hands and murmur apologies 
equally incomprehensible. She 
renewed her private resolution 
to learn the language as soon as 
possible, but right now the Jarra 
were losing patience with her. The 
lords had flown off to their own 
castles and it began to seem that 
she too might be asked to leave. 
Not wishing to give up, Cathy sus- 
pended her efforts in order to 
argue with Devlin, but all she got 
from him was that nothing could 
be done. 

She was composing a few subtle 
remarks for Devlin's return when 
the faint sound of rocket motors 
reached down through the corri- 
dors of the castle. 

“I didn't expect the RLV so 
soon," she said, looking at her 
watch as she got up — and to her 
surprise, Heraxt did not under- 
stand. 

When she emerged from the cas- 
tle on to the crag, she saw why. The 



descending rocket was not the 
RLV, nor, she guessed from 
Heraxt's reaction, anything from 
the Furtherance fleet. Shock- 
absorbing legs were opening 
around the brilliant flame as it 
came vertically down: the noise 
forced the watchers back behind 
the muffling walls of stone. 

The creatures that emerged were 
humanoid, though their golden 
spacesuits hid details. They came 
across the landing area with great 
assurance and the Jarra passed 
Cathy and Heraxt in the entry and 
went out to meet them. It was 
obvious that they had met before. 
A few words were exchanged; then 
the group came back in silence 
and Cathy and Heraxt followed 
them, baffled and ignored, into the 
castle and between the tapestries 
of the ancient corridors. 

As they came once again to the 
conference hall of Carraine, 
Heraxt obviously made up his 
mind about the situation. Taking 
Cathy's arm, he drew her quietly 
aside; though she resisted, she 
could do nothing against his high- 
gravity strength. Without hurry- 
ing, he drew her steadily down the 
access hall. Cathy’s protests went 
uncomprehended, but she knew 
this was wrong. Something ter- 
rible was going to happen — and 
suddenly she knew what it was. 
Glimpses of the future were rare 
for her, though second-sight sup- 
posedly ran in her family, but she 
saw clearly what was going to hap- 



LIAISON ASSIGNMENT 



99 




pen. A show of force attempted, a 
weapon produced, cries of rage 
from the Jarra — the lord of Car- 
raine would rise from his place, 
black wings opening to balance 
him as his skeleton adjusted for 
flight, arms thrust forward — with 
one backward sweep of his wings, 
rise from the floor and strike with 
white, clawlike hands at the 
golden-suited enemy. 

“We mustn’t leave them togeth- 
er — ’’ she cried — and a moment 
later from down the hall came a 
shriek of avian fury. 

Heraxt stopped dead. Cathy 
wrenched her arm free and turned 
back, slowing, however, as she 
realized what she would rush into 
without means to make herself 
understood. 

The alien lay sprawled on the 
floor, a great gash torn in the 
golden spacesuit below the helmet, 
the gun lying far across the hall. 
The Jarra lord hovered over him, 
under the stone arches of the roof, 
slow strokes of his wings keeping 
him airborne. He was staring 
down, his face shadowed by the 
raised shell-cases on his back. The 
white hands hung vertically, 
splashed with blood. We must re- 
main neutral, thought Cathy, we 
must calm this down. She walked 
deliberately forward, amazed 
and appalled by her own nerve, 
and kneeled under those terrible 
claws to examine the body. Body 
it definitely was, now she could 
see into that dreadful wound. 



How do I cope with this? she 
thought frantically, pausing for a 
moment before straightening up. 
Persuade him first to come 
down . 

Suddenly she was desperate to 
get out from under those claws. If 
the Jarra should swoop at her, her 
U.N. blouse would be no protec- 
tion at all, much less than the 
spacesuit Carraine had torn so 
easily. And in another moment of 
insight and horror, she realized 
how it was going to happen. Be- 
fore she could react the missing 
aliens appeared in the doorway, 
guns already raised. Fire crackled 
across the hall and down came the 
Jarra, clawing blindly at the air 
as it fell. 

T he Interface relay was almost 
spherical, though the shape was 
made up of complex components 
fitting one into another. McKay 
suspected it was like that all the 
way through, a Jigsaw of solid- 
state components. Thrust out 
from the cargo hatch, it floated 
around the moon with the RLV as 
McKay completed the activation 
routine. 

“Dev’s calling you from 
Sarann," Lang reported. 

McKay shifted his attention and 
the computer display altered 
accordingly. 

“Acknowledge.” 

“Devlin to RLV, Devlin to RLV, 
report your position please.” 
“We’re orbiting the moon, get- 



100 



GALAXY 




ting ready to come back. What's 
the problem?" 

“You're up there and I'm in the 
shuttle. What's taking off from 
Carraine?" 

“Get back there and find 
out — we're on our way." McKay 
had been spinning out the activa- 
tion of the relay, with the excuse 
that he wanted to learn more about 
its systems. All he had to do was 
say, “Activate — “ and it was 
ready for use. He selected exit code 
for the Sarann relay, specifying 
position and airspeed required, 
and ordered, “Up Interface — " A 
circle of pale blue sky half a mile 
across opened in vacuum in front 
of the ship and he fired the vernier 
motors to push the ship through it. 

They glided out over the worn 
landscape and McKay opened the 
intakes and started up the ram- 
jets. A rising cloud of smoke and 
dust marked Carraine's valley; 
McKay made two turns to put the 
ship on the same approach as the 
Furtherance shuttle streak ing 
over the crags. 

McKay overtook the shuttle as 
it made a low pass over the site of 
Carraine. He was fairly sure it was 
the site of Carraine, but he 
checked with the ship's memory of 
the landscape to make sure. For 
the castle itself was gone: it and 
the crag it stood on had been 
turned to slag by the nuclear boost 
of the departing ship a great 
wound of molten rock, still drain- 
ing sluggishly into the valley. 



“The ship's our first puzzle," 
said McKay after they landed at 
Bira. Anything to keep Devlin's 
thoughts from Cathy. “You don't 
think it left the planet?” 

“Not on that trajectory," Dev- 
lin replied, raging. “They didn’t 
need a nuclear takeoff even for 
that flimsy reason. Either that was 
deliberate murder, Mac, or they 
were covering up something 
worse they'd done — " 

“Easy. They're still on Sarann 
somewhere. If that damned satel- 
lite had been overhead we could 
have tracked them." Though the 
satellite could generate an Inter- 
face linking one side of the planet 
to the other, to use it you had to 
have line-of-sight radio contact. 
“Who are they, then? Where are 
they from?” 

“They have been here for many 
months," the lord of Bira put in. 
“Beyond these mountains they 
have built a structure, on which we 
keep watch. At first we helped and 
supplied them, but their demands 
grew. We waited to see whether 
you were like them or would league 
with them.” 

Everyone wanted to speak, but 
McKay silenced them with a per- 
emptory wave. He stood and faced 
the Jarra. 

“They have killed our people as 
well as yours." 

“We will destroy them," said the 
Jarra. “You may league with us." 

The assurance of it, thought 
McKay. They, the birdlords, with 

101 



LIAISON ASSIGNMENT 




only their brains and physical 
strength, would accept the aid of 
interstellar civilization to fight 
off the strangers. And then he 
thought. Perhaps their race is older 
than interstellar (ivilization. As 
he faced the Jarra his subcon- 
scious still screamed Monster . 
But intellect told him that these 
were allies he could trust. 

“What are they?” 

“In shape much like yourselves. 
But they wear metallic suits at all 
times and do not walk in the air of 
our world. Not so very different 
from us when we walk the ground, 
but wingless.” 

“They do not use Interface as 
we do?” 

Kiliath seemed to be seeking re- 
assurance rather than informa- 
tion. McKay didn’t listen, be- 
cause the satellite should now be 
above the horizon. He said noth- 
ing, not to arouse false hopes even 
for a moment, but plugged in, 
scanning the planet for Cathy’s 
medallion communicator via the 
RLV’s banks. 

The signal was there. “Inter- 
rogate,” he said quietly. 

The others were looking at him. 
“Mac — ” 

“She’s alive,” said McKay. The 
atmosphere lightened at once. 
“Alive but unconscious. Plug in 
to this, all of you.” 

T hey all had full communica- 
tors and the RLV circuits could 
get a picture from Cathy’s medal- 



lion. Since she was lying uncon- 
scious, apparently at floor level, 
not much could be seen — but two 
of the aliens were standing near 
her. 

“They are called the ...” said 
Bira. The name was in the wrong 
language and the computer 
translation left it out. 

“Just give us the sound,” said 
McKay. 

“They call themselves the AL 
Tanrai. In your language — ” 

“ — the Cosmic Jackals,” said 
Lang, speaking suddenly as if 
hypnotized. 

McKay cut the perception 
circuit with a jerk. Lang was still 
staring into space — whether still 
plugged in or for some deeper rea- 
son could not at once be told. 

“What do you — ” 

“Don’t interrupt,” said Lang, 
obviously under great strain, “or 
I’ll lose it again — ” 

“Record,” said McKay to his 
own communicator and held it 
forward. 

“The A1 Tanrai were part of the 
attack on Earth.” Lang was al- 
most whispering. “They came in 
the later stages, when the ground 
was already broken. They prefer 
to do that, to dog greater powers 
through the Galaxy. Their ships are 
faster than light. They are a group 
mind: if they were all to gather 
together only one intelligence 
would be present, a single con- 
sciousness. That was how it was at 
their beginning.” 



102 



GALAXY 




A total silence had possessed the 
group. Even the Jarra seemed fas- 
cinated. “They are creatures of a 
giant world,” Lang went on. 
“Methane and ammonia, great 
cold, great pressure. They had 
an Earth-type companion planet, 
where the inhabitants perfected 
space travel and went down to 
them. .” Lang paused again. 
“Don’t think of the humanoid 
forms as people or even as slaves. 
They lost everything long, long 
ago. They’re only extensions of 
the Al Tanrai mind: if you de- 
stroy the element controlling 
them, the humanoids are mind- 
less. .” Lang seemed to lose his 
thread. 

“They are vulnerable?” 
prompted McKay. 

“Yes. They travel in groups and 
if you knock out one unit when 
they’re in rapport -you can be 
lucky and paralyze the rest. Their 
pressurized tanks are the Achil- 
les’ heel — they decompress and 
burn in air if you rupture them,” 
Lang finished in a great rush. 

“Anything more?” asked Mc- 
Kay after another long pause. 

“No, that’s all I know about 
them. 1 keep losing track even 
of that. .” 

“Let it go,” said McKay. “It’s 
all recorded — you needn’t hold it in 
mind.” 

Lang relaxed and gradually 
came back to normalcy. “Did I tell 
you anything important?” he 
asked. 



“You gave us the lowdown on 
them from start to finish,” said 
Devlin. He was still intensely 
angry. 

“Thank God for that,” said 
Lang, relaxing still further. “It 
had to be important, whatever it 
was.” 

“Someone did a great job on 
your memory,” McKay remarked 
wonderingly. “As if all knowl- 
edge of the attacks had to be con- 
cealed. A lot of alien ships were 
destroyed then. I wonder if any of 
the Al Tanrai escaped from 
Earth?” 

“None,” said Lang with great 
abruptness. 

“You remember some more?” 

“What are they doing with 
Cathy?” Devlin exploded, unable 
to keep quiet any longer. 

“They took a girl last time,” 
Lang said, rushing again. “When 
they landed in San Francisco and 1 
drove them off, they were taking a 
girl back to the ship. They used ex- 
plosives to force people out of the 
ruins.” 

“What for?” 

“I stopped them,” said Lang. 
“We never found out.” 

“Let’s not be too patient now,” 
Slazeck put in. “We know their 
weaknesses, we have an advan- 
tage. Let’s move!” 

The clock had gone back ten 
years, thought McKay. Back to 
the time of the attacks. Everyone 
had scores to settle. 

Aloud he said, “If we make a 



LIAISON ASSIGNMENT 



103 




Ill 



straight attack we’ll lose Cathy for 
sure. Bira, didn’t you say the place 
was watched?” 

“Watched and surrounded,” Bi- 
ra affirmed. 

“You have men placed for bat- 
tle?” 

“To the north and to the east.” 

“Great,” McKay said. “Can we 
get past their defenses?” 

Kiliath broke the ensuing pause. 
“Time may be very short. Let us 
take the shuttle and go with Bira to 
raise up his powers. Friend Mc- 
Kay, be ready to bring the RLV 
through Interface if we call for it. 
Fate may give us an oppor- 
tunity —perhaps only a brief 
one — and we must be ready to seize 
it.” 

The meeting broke up but Mc- 
Kay made sure he caught Kiliath 
alone. “Why this urgency? You 
are holding something back from 
us.” 

“1 hold nothing back,” said 
Kiliath’s translation. “1 press for 
action for Cathy’s sake. We must 
miss no chance for her rescue — it 
grieves me that you are less con- 
siderate.” 

“Less considerate? Devlin’s 
nearly out of his mind and 1 — ” 

“The translation misleads you,” 
said Kiliath. The machine was 
failing to express some emotion, 
certainly, McKay could tell. “1 
thought of Heraxt, whom the satel- 
lite cannot locate. He and his 
communicator are one with the 
slag of Carraine.” 



S LAZECK and McKay waited at 
the RLV controls, in the armor 
they would almost certainly need 
for the rescue. What a cultural 
showing we’re making, McKay 
thought. Heraxt may have died 
protecting Cathy, and we never 
gave him a thought. It’s lucky we 
do have an outside enemy on to 
whom we can project our inade- 
quacies and dissatisfactions. 

The rescue “plan” was packed 
with both: basically, it was that 
the Jarra should draw the fire of 
the Jackal base; the RLV would 
make a surprise strike out of 
Interface to knock out the defen- 
ses and the shuttle would dive in to 
make the rescue. If the AL Tanrai 
were the professionals Lang de- 
scribed, McKay thought, they 
were inviting a massacre. 

“The only point for our side,” he 
said, “is that the A1 Tanrai may 
not realize this ship can fight. It’s a 
leftover from previous Further- 
ance troubles and its weapons are 
obsolete by their standards — 1 
suppose they’d never let us use it 
otherwise — but it is built to make 
rescues in combat, which makes 
it a damn sight more use than that 
damn shuttle.” 

“I certainly thought Kiliath 
meant us to do liaison work for 
the big starships when he asked us 
along,” Slazeck said. 

“1 never would have — what the 
hell?” His communications relay 



104 



GALAXY 




had Just punched him in the back of 
the head. 

“We are the A1 Tanrai," said the 
translation voice of the ship. “We 
have detected the intrusion of 
your Interface into a region of 
space we have roamed for a thou- 
sand years. You will not find us 
obliging hosts." 

“Mac, this is impossible," said 
Slazeck. 

“It’s not impossible,” McKay 
snapped. “They've bugged our 
satellite. No wonder their base 
didn’t show on Kiliath’s surveys." 

“Your species is new to us, so we 
took the female for examination. 
Our preliminary inquiries be- 
ing completed, you may recover 
this unit if you require it. Do not 
use your Interface within ten 
miles of our base or you will be de- 
stroyed. We are the A1 Tanrai; our 
statement ends." 

The pilots exchanged glances. 
“Well?” 

“It’s the chance Kiliath was hop- 
ing for. We can get in among them 
before the shooting starts." 

“Alternatively, they’ve detected 
the Jarra and the shuttle closing 
in on them and they want to elimi- 
nate the RLV, as the unknown 
factor in the situation.” 

“They may get a surprise,’’ 
commented McKay, his anger re- 
newed. “Rescue ship or not, this 
baby has teeth!” 

The RLV was already airborne, 
rising on VTOL thrust, turning 
out over the valley. McKay con- 



verted smoothly to jet and then 
ramjet propulsion, climbing 
toward Interface altitude. 

“It has powerful eyes as well,” 
said Slazeck. “They may not 
realize we can pinpoint Cathy’s 
location in their base." 

“They’ll probably guess that. 
The shuttle has some pretty ad- 
vanced sensors and I suspect the 
A1 Tanrai have that ship pretty well 
sized up. On that basis they won’t 
be expecting weapons or rescue 
systems — or rocket maneuvers!” 

“I don’t get you, Mac. The 
shuttle has rocket motors, fusion- 
powered like ours." 

“It doesn’t have independent 
aerospace capability,” McKay 
replied, banking away from his 
original course. “It can work in 
space if Interface puts it there, but 
its total velocity change is two 
miles a second or less. Even if the 
A1 Tanrai know we went to the 
moon they probably think our 
fuel’s all gone." 

“I don’t see the good of that,” 
Slazeck protested. 

“You will," promised McKay. 
At least he had a plan to work on. 
“Take over and keep heading 
away from them meantime — we 
need as long a run for this as we 
can get.” 

S OME minutes later the ship 
turned back to its original 
course. Now fully suited and sealed 
into his acceleration shield, 
McKay looked on as Slazeck 



LIAISON ASSIGNMENT 



105 




pulled up the nose, closed t|ie air 
intakes and Fired the Fusion 
motor. The RLV went up on a 
column oF blue Flame, matching 
the sub-orbital trajectory oF the 
A1 Tanrai ship. Xhe projected 
point oF impact moved over the 
horizon, across the mountains in- 
to the vicinity oF the alien base. 

“That does it,” said McKay. He 
had separated the capsule From 
the ship’s liFe-support system. 
“Here 1 go.” 

“Good luck, Mac.” The percep- 
tion circuits blanked out as Mc- 
Kay ejected From the ship. 

He plugged in again at once, to 
watch as Slazeck turned the coast- 
ing ship over and fired the brilliant 
motor again. As Fast as it had come 
up the RLV decelerated, curving 
the high peak oF its trajectory 
back down into the atmosphere. 
The capsule rode on alone. 

It had been vital to complete the 
rocket maneuvers beFore they 
broke the horizon oF the alien 
base. The ship itselF could be made 
invisible to radar, but the Fusion 
exhaust would be hard to hide. As 
For the capsule, its designers had 
Foreseen the possibility that the 
escaping astronaut might not want 
to be conspicuous. With its May- 
day systems turned oFF, the cap- 
sule was well-nigh undetectable. 

McKay extended the tiny peri- 
scope and watched the wrinkled 
Face oF Sarann turning past. The 
acceleration shield/escape cap- 
sule/stretcher unit had always 



seemed to him to be the best part oF 
the RLV’s design. He would be 
using the system to the utmost 
this time — always supposing the 
Al Tanrai didn't spot him coming 
down. 

He wasn’t moving Fast enough, 
he hoped. For a Flare oF ionization 
to give him away. In due course the 
instruments told him he could put 
out the periscope again — and 
there was the Al Tanrai base, three 
linked spheres with a cluster oF sup- 
porting installations, sitting in 
the desert just beyond the hills. 
About ten miles From it, he should 
be a barely visible speck dropping 
down the sky. It was midday now 
and there was plenty oF glare. 

The rising hills hid him From the 
base. He Flipped the capsule over 
into liFting body altitude, slow- 
ing up dramatically, and came 
down on a hillside, starting the 
Fans to cushion the impact. 
Though the re-entry hadn’t been 
fiery, heat was now beginning to 
soak through From the heat- 
shield — once out oF the capsule, 
McKay pulled a toggle that blew 
the shield clear. 

Apart From the cragtops oF Car- 
raine and Bira this was his first 
time on Sarran soil. It wasn’t as 
barren as it looked From the 
air — he saw clumps oF thorny 
plants all around him on the hill- 
side. McKay didn’t pause, but 
broke open more oF the shielding 
and Fetched out the two guns he 
had carried with him From the 



106 



GALAXY 




ship. Pull-out sections in the nose 
of the capsule, now the heatshield 
was gone, made slits for the guns 
when they were mounted beside the 
couch. With sights, trigger and 
windshield set up the unit became 
a flying sled, using the remaining 
shielding for armor. McKay 
started up the fans again and made 
for the alien base, hugging the hill- 
sides. 

The A1 Tanrai obviously thought 
they had a future on Sarran. 
Though their base sat on the firm 
sand, not in it, setting it down must 
have been a major undertaking. 
The three big spheres, with their 
supporting girders and piping, 
made the place look vaguely like an 
oil refinery. The surrounding 
huts and tents for the humanoid 
extensions of the A1 Tanrai mind 
were of lighter construction. 
McKay noticed launch trolleys to 
bring the rockets to the spheres: 
the ship which had snatched Cathy 
was still in a gantry at the end of 
the row. He could see how the Al 
Tanrai had become nomads in 
space — in general, installations 
like this would be easier to man- 
age in free-fall. 

T IWENTY miles away the RLV 
came out of Interface. McKay 
couldn’t see it, but his implanted 
relay told him it was there. The 
ship was broadcasting its pres- 
ence, supposedly to the Al Tanrai, 
but alerting McKay, Devlin and 
Kiliath without giving them 



away. McKay slid back down the 
slope, settled on the sled and 
plugged in. Opposing FTL ships 
with this cockleshell was like 
pitting a crossbow against a 
machinegun, he thought; you had 
to make sure you got the guy with 
your first shot. 

Ten miles out, on final approach, 
Slazeck flicked on the RLV search 
devices to locate Cathy. This was 
the biggest risk in their plan; that 
the Al Tanrai would have put her 
where her medallion was screened 
from interrogation. But they 
hadn’t: she was still where they’d 
seen her last. It was an airlock in 
the upper part of one of the 
spheres, on the far side from 
McKay. She was still uncon- 
scious, still guarded, but the lock 
door was open. McKay raced the 
sled over the hilltop. As Slazeck 
continued his drawn-out, conspic- 
uous approach, McKay made his 
dash across from the hills. That 
half-minute of racing high over 
the desert was the longest of his 
life. 

Since he was attacking an upper 
level, the spheres themselves gave 
him cover. He curved over a con- 
necting tunnel, rounded the sphere 
to the airlock, guns blazing as he 
came down on the platform by the 
outer door. Probably the guards 
never saw him at all. Another surge 
of lift from the protesting fans and 
he was inside the lock. 

McKay was off the sled in a sec- 
ond, lifting out one of the guns. 



LIAISON ASSIGNMENT 



107 




The A1 Tanrai must know he was 
here, if only because their 
“eyes” — the guards here — had 
been taken out. Their attention 
would switch to the lock, away 
from the incoming ship — but to 
reach him, their minions would 
have to come through that outer 
door with the sunlight behind 
them. He could hold the lock long 
enough to negotiate. 

Covering the entrance, McKay 
bent down to Cathy. She was lying 
face down, not bound or re- 
strained in any way, just neatly 
laid on the metal floor. What had 
they been doing to her? He found 
only one injury, an ugly senseless 
wound across her back like a triple 
clawmark raked through clothing 
and skin. To what question did 
that supply an answer, in God’s 
name? 

The RLV was approaching 
touchdown. Slazeck had con- 
verted to STOL thrust, put down 
flaps and gear and with them had 
extended the ship’s two cannons, 
above and below the fuselage, 
trained on the spheres. McKay was 
about to tell him to hold his fire 
when he saw that the lock door- 
way was less than half its former 
height. 

He had assumed the outer door 
was retracted into the wall — in- 
stead, the airlock floor was rising 
toward the curved segment of the 
sphere overhead. McKay had 
noticed that the floor area was less 
than half the section through the 



sphere; even so, the volume of air 
to be flushed out seemed exces- 
sive. Now he realized, as the re- 
maining half-circle of sunlight 
became a shrinking segment, 
that the pressure below was rais- 
ing the floor to plug the entrance 
and expel air from vents in the top 
of the dome. The sliver of sunlight 
vanished and his contact with the 
ship was simultaneously cut off. 

Any second now, thought 
McKay, we’re in for a methane- 
ammonia quick-freeze. He 
bundled Cathy into the sled and 
slammed down the shielding be- 
fore sealing his own faceplate and 
going on to the suit’s air supply. 
Suit and stretcher could both cope 
with the low temperature, but not 
with the pressure change he an- 
ticipated. 

Outside, Slazeck had evidently 
discovered McKay was in trouble. 
He boosted the vertical compo- 
nent of the thrust, arresting the 
touchdown, and the RLV sailed 
down the row of spheres, pumping 
armor-piercing shells into the 
underside of each. Freezing va- 
por sprayed out behind it. 

McKay heard the shells pene- 
trate and explode. A series of mas- 
sive shocks through the sphere 
knocked him from his feet and 
bounced him in his armor on the 
metal floor. Slazeck was banking 
away from the weakened domes. 
In ragged sequence hatches blew 
out under each, dropping to the 
ground as ramps — used in the con- 



108 



GALAXY 




struction of the base, presum- 
ably. Down each, now, the Al 
Tanrai living environment 
erupted in explosive decompres- 
sion, boiling instantly as it hit 
the desert air. Icy mist enveloped 
all the area around the spheres and, 
under it, fires were starting. 



T he airlock floor was dropping 
again as the pressure beneath it 
went down. Obviously the effect of 
the shells had been catastrophic; 
McKay doubted the Al Tanrai 
could have survived as an im- 
mediate danger. He was more 
worried now that the spheres might 
blow up before he and Cathy got 
clear — all kinds of systems must 
have been thrown into chaos. Sun- 
light stabbed across the floor again 
as the top of the outer door came 
into view. 

Standing in the doorway, as the 
airlock floor came to rest, was one 
of the golden-suited humanoids. 
It started forward immediately, 
gun swinging, following the 
group-mind’s last volition; but 
once inside, its brain was empty. 
The gun continued to swing in 
futile arcs. Lest it should fire, Mc- 
Kay shot the creature down as one 
might end a wasp’s struggles with 
insecticide. Outside he found a 
party of them, crawling aimless- 
ly on the ladder and scaffolding 
leading to the platform. Beyond 
doubt, the Al Tanrai were dead. 
Already the sun and breeze be- 



tween them were disposing of the 
fog below. He led the stretcher 
unit down the scaffolding, avoid- 
ing the big ramps with their burn- 
ing organic debris, and struck out 
across the sand to what should be a 
safe distance. Slazeck was bring- 
ing back the ship, jets filling but 
not defeating the great silence 
which had fallen over the enemy 
outpost. 

He raised the stretcher on its 
fans to the recovery hatch, and 
Slazeck took it aboard. The main 
airlock was open, like a big air- 
brake in the white underside of the 
ship; McKay stepped on the door 
and it lifted him. 

“What’s taking so long in 
there?" Slazeck asked. 

“Suit decontamination,” Mc- 
Kay answered. “Sarran’s clear 
for us, but who knows what Al 
Tanrai bugs we’re carrying.” The 
medic tapes would deal with any- 
thing alien Cathy had picked up. 

McKay took his time. He had no 
regrets about the Al Tanrai, but 
Cathy’s injury upset him. Not 
only had he, as mission com- 
mander, let it happen, but he had 
had to rescue her, Devlin being 
out of reach. This was the second 
time that had happened, and he 
worried about the effect on their 
relationship. 

“Here comes the shuttle,” Sla- 
zeck reported. 

“Okay, I’ll go back out.” 

They were getting out of the 
shuttle on the far side, looking to- 



LIAISON ASSIGNMENT 



109 




wards the spheres; Lang, Devlin, 
the Fallaran, Bira. 

“I think Cathy’s all right,” Mc- 
Kay told them when they reached 
the ship. “Her back’s injured, but 
it’s only a flesh wound. Medic 
tape’s not come up with anything 
else.” 

“It will be best to return her to 
familiar surroundings,” said 
Kiliath. “1 have declared this an 
emergency situation, so Further- 
ance warships will be here in a few 
hours at most. If I must ask for 
more help, friend McKay, I will 
send a message sphere to Earth.” 

“Are you sure we should leave? 
There may be other A1 Tanrai 
units in this planetary system.” 

“Quite possibly,” said Lang. 
“They usually check out the gas 
giant planets, I think. But if they 
were in rapport with this element 
they, too, will have ‘died’ like these 
humanoids.” 

“The lunar relay, which is free of 
interference, will warn us if they 
approach,” said Kiliath. “And 
the weapons of the planetary re- 
lay will hold them off until units of 
our fleet arrive. Take Cathy to 
Earth to recover.” 

An explosion reverberated in- 
side the A1 Tanrai spheres. Black 
smoke began to pour from an 
open airlock. 

“All right, let’s go,” said Mc- 
kay. 

W AITING to go through the 
lock, he looked back at the 



non-human group. The Jarra fea- 
tures gave him the same shock: 
alien, however familiar. The 
Fallaran and Jarra were still in 
conference by the shuttle when 
McKay took off. He flew around 
the end of the base on VTOL 
thrust, converted and pulled away 
over the desert, waves of sound 
echoing on the hills below. 

“The satellite’s not yet here,” he 
announced as the RLV went on 
up, “but it will be by the time we’re 
high enough.” Five thousand feet 
was as near to the ground as he 
cared to use Interface. 

Scanning the expanding view, 
the RLV sensors detected a flick- 
er of movement. McKay di- 
rected his attention to it and it 
grew into a black flight of Jarra, 
already well past the sphere-base 
and flying on to some unknown 
destination. What lay further 
down the mountain chain McKay 
had no idea, but he was sure the 
Jarra knew where they were going. 
He let the steadfast group fade 
back into the barren landscape. 

The head-up display drew a pat- 
tern of lines intersecting the hori- 
zon, crossing and pinpointing the 
rising satellite. McKay had al- 
ready set exit code for Earth. 

“Up Interface — ” 

For their own field they now had 
an Interface corridor, a strip of 
sky avoided by other aircraft. 
They came out into sunset over 
Montana, contacted the tower and 
began a routine letdown. 



110 



GALAXY 




An ambulance was waiting by 
the hangar when McKay taxied 
in. “She doesn’t need to go to a 
hospital,” he said. “We’ll take 
her home and be sure one of us is 
around when she wakes up.” 

“Okay,” said Lang. “Walt and 1 
will come over later.” 

Devlin and McKay rode in the 
ambulance. As they left the space- 
field McKay became aware of a 
curious pattern in the glass be- 
side him. He rubbed at the win- 
dow, but the deposit wouldn’t 
come off. 

At Cathy’s address the ambu- 
lance driver and nurse lifted 
Cathy’s stretcher in and trans- 
ferred her into bed. She still wore 
the slightly troubled expression 
McKay had noticed when he first 
reached her, but was sleeping 
peacefully. 

“She’ll be all right,” he said. 

“If I’m going to stay here to- 
night I’ll need a few things,” said 
Devlin. “Mac, will you make 
yourself at home? I’ll be back di- 
rectly.” 

“I’ll drop you on my way to the 
field,” said the ambulance driver. 

Taking Devlin at his word, Mc- 
Kay made for the kitchen. He 
made coffee and a sandwich, left 
the kettle simmering for Devlin 
and went through to switch on the 
television set. 

The image took unusually long 
to form — McKay was turning 
back, puzzled, when the screen flu- 
oresced at last. Glowing red across 



it was the same pattern he had 
noticed on the ambulance win- 
dow. The screen cracked a moment 
later and McKay ducked just in 
time as the tube imploded. 

The TV lamp overturned, plung- 
ing the room into darkness, and 
broken glass was everywhere. As 
he crunched over to disconnect 
the set, McKay’s racing mind' 
Tilled in the gaps. The A1 Tanrai 
had the satellite bugged, all 
right — he guessed at the perfor- 
mance of the device. A two- 
dimensional perception pickup 
stretched across the Interface, 
clinging to the surface of the ship 
as it went through? No re-entry to 
burn it off. Opening the airlock 
would not break its tension and 
the first man out would carry it 
with him, flowing like an invisi- 
ble veil, seeking another surface 
to cling to. He and Devlin had had 
unwittingly carried it here — and 
though the unexpected flux of 
electrons had burned it out, all its 
impressions up to now had gone 
somewhere. 

Intuitively, McKay guessed it. 
Somewhere in the regions beyond 
Earth, into which the Interface 
was beginning to penetrate, a sig- 
nal had been received. Some- 
where among those stars, in some 
orbital or planetary hideout, the 
A1 Tanrai had found Earth again. 

With a heavy heart he picked up 
the phone, to call the U.N. and 
alert the Committee for Earth’s 
Defense. ★

GORDON EKLUND 



Eternal life poses 
a question. Is it 
reward— or punishment? 



1 

J OHN MILLBURN NANCE 
was the biggest, grossest, fattest, 
most domineering sloppy old man 
in the entire Western Hemispheric 
U nion, including all the people who 
lived in, under, and above the 
oceans, lakes and rivers. 

John Millburn Nance was also 
the most brilliant criminal lawyer 
of his time. 

He sat in a chair that had been 
especially built to accommodate 
his bulk and spoke to his wife, who 
lay in her bed at his side. Nance 



113 




talked in a gentle, soothing voice, 
but even his softest whispers were 
normally powerful enough to 
pierce all but the most securely 
sound-proofed walls. As a young 
man, Nance had- spent many years 
perfecting his voice as an instru- 
ment absolutely essential to the 
successful performance of his 
profession and, although he had 
now been retired for ten years, it 
was not an ability he could easily 
shed. 

Nance spoke to his wife in a soft, 
gentle tone because he was still 
very much in love with her. They 
had married fifty-two years earlier 
and during the last ten of those 
years had not exchanged a single 
word. Nance talked to Marilyn 
he did little except talk to her 
but she never replied. She could 
not. 

From the neck down Marilyn 
Nance was a machine. She lay in 
bed — where she had lain for ten 
years — and her husband talked to 
her. A never-ending series of 
whirrs, clicks, hums and buzzes 
emanated from the lower portion 
of her body. But she never spoke. 

She should rightly have been 
dead. The helicar she had been 
driving had fallen fifty feet to 
strike nose-first into solid city 
pavement. There hadn’t been 
much left, only a faintly beating 
heart, when she had been pulled 
from the wreckage. And soon that, 
too, had stopped. 

John Millburn Nance had been a 



rich man then and he had loved his 
wife. So, unlike Humpty Dumpty, 
she had been put back together 
again. She could not talk and she 
had no arms or legs or torso, but 
she was alive. The best medical 
specialists in the WHU had all as- 
sured Nance of this one plain fact: 
his wife was alive. 

And so, ten hours a day, seven 
days a week, fifty-two weeks a 
year, he came to her room, sat at 
her side, ignored the noises that 
came from beneath her blankets 
and talked to her. He did not know 
if she heard him or, if she heard 
him, whether she understood him. 
He had asked the specialists and 
they had replied. Yes, perhaps, to 
the first question and. No, prob- 
ably not, to the second. Nance had 
long since stopped caring. He 
talked to his wife because he hap- 
pened to love her. If she heard him, 
if she understood him, that was 
merely a bonus to add to his satis- 
faction. 

H e said, “I’ll be leaving just as 
soon as we’re through here and, 
as I said, I ought to be back in a 
week — two weeks at the very most. 

“Yes, yes, I know what you’d 
say, if you could. You’d remind 
me that I promised never to leave 
these acres again. When I told you 
that, I meant it — and I meant it, 
too when I said I’d never take an- 
other case as long as that slot ma- 
chine was acting as judge and jury. 
“But this one is different.

Marilyn, and 1 only hope you can 
understand. Sarah Bigelow was 
a very dear friend of mine once and 
1 cared a great deal about her wel- 
fare. True, all of this was many 
years ago and surely she has 
changed since. But I did love her 
once. Not as 1 love you, but in a 
different way, the way a father 
feels about a daughter who turns 
out well. But, nonetheless, 1 did 
love Sarah. 

“And now they say she has killed 
a man. I know — a hundred mur- 
ders a day in this great land of 
ours. The killers are caught (for 
the most part), they are tried be- 
fore that machine, they are con- 
victed and they are treated. It is all 
routine. 

“But for me, murder can never 
be a routine crime. It will always 
be the extraordinary one, the 
crime that is unlike all other 
crimes, the one that is most fre- 
quently committed by noncrim- 
inals. 

“So, you see, Sarah is my friend, 
and because she is my friend, she 
is deserving of the best. And I’m 
still the best. 1 know more law in 
my little finger than all the new 
breed lawyers. East and West, put 
together.” 

Nance paused and wiped his 
hands on the edge of the covering 
blanket. He looked at Marilyn 
but, as he had known, her face was 
without expression. His eyes 
moved past her, beyond the win- 
dow, outside. He looked at the 



sun, which stood in the sky, gazing 
like a proud father at the earth 
below it. Trees grew tall and bright 
out there and autumn leaves flut- 
tered to the ground in small, bright 
clumps. Nance would hate to leave 
this place even for a week. It was 
more than a home. It was a magic 
wonderland, all five acres of it. 
The thought of bleak concrete in 
an endless city repulsed him. 
Nance was seventy-six years old. 
He had a few years left to him and 
he wanted to spend them all right 
where he was — among the trees 
and leaves, beneath the pink and 
gold sun. 

He said, “If I understood the 
crime I wouldn’t go, but I’ve read 
about it, talked to people about it, 
and there’s no sense to be found in 
what I’ve learned. Sarah sup- 
posedly poisoned this man, 
Oakes. He was her boss on a top- 
secret government project. 
They’ve got everything they need 
to. convict her: Evidence that 
points to her, a couple of eyewit- 
nesses and a confession. They’ve 
got everything, that is, except a 
motive. And she wants to plead 
guilty. 

“The government was going to 
supply her with a whole battery of 
lawyers till I stuck my nose 
in — through a friend — and took 
care of that. I’m her legally ap- 
pointed attorney now. I don’t 
think she even knows it yet — and 
when she finds out she’ll probably 
be pretty unhappy. But there’s 



DEFENDEROF DEATH

nothing she can do. I saw to that. 
I'm going to save that girl whether 
she wants to be saved or not. 

“There isn’t a motive, you see. 
Nothing that lo.oks vaguely like 
one — and there»’s one thing I've 
learned in fifty years of close asso- 
ciation with murderers. They've 
all got a reason for what they've 
done. It might be a twisted reason. 
It might not have a thing to do with 
the actual victim. But there's a 
reason there, always, without fail. 

“So, do you understand now 
why I’ve got to do it? Do you see 
why I haven't got a choice?" 

Nance paused again and looked 
closely at his wife. Her eyes were 
open and staring. Her cheeks were 
cold and rigid. Her nostrils quiv- 
ered gently. 

He sighed and turned away. 

“I’ll have Samuel come in to 
take care of you. He’ll be with you 
every second he can spare. And 
when he can’t spare one Barbara 
or Eugenia or both will look after 
you. You won't be lonely on ac- 
count of my absence and I’ll be 
back before you know it. I’ll have 
plenty of new stories to tell you. 
It’s been ten years since we've been 
to the city and it’s surely changed 
in the interim. There’ll be a whole 
lot of things you’ll want to know. 
Just wait and see." 

Nance climbed unsteadily to his 
feet. He stood above his wife for a 
moment and shook himself like a 
wet cat. Then he turned toward 
the door. 



His hand on the knob, he 
stopped and swiveled his head. He 
put his free hand to his lips and 
tossed his wife a kiss. 

It was a childish thing for him to 
do, yes. Seventy-six years old and 
still tossing kisses like a boy of 
fifteen. But then, after all, he loved 
her, and it is love which brings out 
the child in all of us, regardless of 
age. 

Nance passed through the door. 
He heard the whisking cough of 
the helicar immediately. 

He hurried outside, muttering 
to himself, “I’m coming, Samuel 
-hold that machine steady — I’m 
on my way.” 

J OHN MILLBURN NANCE 
sat across from his client in a 
tiny, white-walled chamber. He 
watched her face through a plate- 
glass window that divided the 
wide wooden table into two equal 
halves. His chair was uncomfor- 
table and despite his best efforts 
at self-control, he found himself 
squirming as he sat. 

Sarah Bigelow was forty-seven 
and wore her hair fight against her 
scalp. Its once rich blackness was 
now pierced by soft wisps of gray. 
She had never been a beautiful 
woman, but when Nance had first 
known her, twenty years earlier, 
she had been at least handsome. 
Now, in middle age, she was not 
even that. She was competent 
looking, Nance thought, like a 



116 



GALAXY 




well-tuned machine, and nothing 
else. 

“Get out,” she had said when the 
guard had first brought Nance into 
the room. “Out, John — 1 don't 
want you.” 

Nance had shaken his head, 
grinned and waited for the guard 
to depart. Now, alone with her, he 
put his lips close to the glass and 
said, “No.” 

“You don’t seem to 
understand,” Sarah said. “1 don't 
want you.” 

Nance said again, with certain- 
ty, “No.” He shook his head. “I’m 
staying.” 

“Have it your own way, you 
stubborn old man, but I'm not 
telling you a thing.” 

Nance smiled at her and stuck a 
hand into the inner pocket of his 
worn suit. He pulled out a note- 
book, dropped it on the table and 
flipped through the pages. He 
stopped at one point and appeared 
to be reading, moving his lips 
slowly and nodding. 

Without looking up from the 
book he said, “I have a few ques- 
tions.” 

“I won’t answer.” 

Nance looked up at her and 
smiled again. He put his hand into 
his pocket and withdrew a thin, fil- 
ter-tipped cigarette. He put the 
cigarette between his lips and lit it 
with a match. He tossed the match 
over his shoulder. 

“Still breaking the laws, I see,” 
Sarah said. 



Nance took a casual drag on the 
cigarette and exhaled through his 
nostrils. “Law has no right to tell 
a man what to do for his own good. 
If 1 want to cut ten years off my 
lifespan with these things, it’s my 
right.” 

“Just don’t get caught,” she 
said. 

“I’m careful where 1 do my 
smoking. Only in safe places — like 
jails and prisons.” 

Sarah laughed, and Nance 
smiled. 

Nance placed the smoldering 
cigarette on the edge of the table. 
He asked, “Why are you lying?” 
“Who said I was lying?” 

“If you’re not, then tell me why 
you killed Oakes.” 

“It’s in my confession.. Read it.” 
“Your confession is the biggest 
pile of rubbish I’ve read in my life. 
When I was a boy I got in the habit 
of reading mystery novels. Any 
writer who tried to use something 
as obviously phony as your con- 
fession would have got himself 
run out of the country." He 
flipped a page in his notebook, 
glanced down, then up, then down 
again. “You claim you killed 
Oakes because you were jealous of 
his work. To me that doesn’t make 
the slightest bit of sense.” 

“But it’s the truth.” 

Nance leaned far forward and 
put his lips against the glass. His 
jowls danced and quivered. “You 
say you were working late with 
him. You deliberately doctored

his coffee with two tablets of 
HTC, knowing that he was al- 
lergic to it. He drank the coffee 
and the two of you went right 
ahead and worked for fifteen more 
minutes. Then, suddenly, he said 
he had to leave. He walked out- 
side, sprinted down the steps and 
fell dead in front of four witness- 
es, including a deputy patrolman." 

“That's the way it happened," 
Sarah said. “You see, 1 didn’t 
know he was going to slip out on 
me. I planned to hide his body 
in" 

“Oh, close your trap." Nance 
slammed shut his notebook. “And 
get a fact or two straight in your 
head. First, I’m your attorney and 
I’m going to get you off. You can’t 
stop me, Sarah. Your Research 
Associates Incorporated, they 
can’t stop me. And your govern- 
ment of the Western Hemis- 
pheric Union, it can’t stop me 
either. Nobody can. Two weeks 
from today at the most you’re 
going to be a free woman.” 

“But I killed a man." 



N ance pulled his face away 
from the glass and opened his 
notebook again. He turned a page. 

“Tell me this much,” he said. 
“Tell me why Oakes killed him- 
self.” 

His eyes leaped upward to meet 
hers. He was looking for some- 
thing, if only a hint, but was met by 
blank indifference. 



“I killed him.” 

“Why?” 

“Jealousy." 

“Why did you kill him so 
stupidly?” 

“Inexperience. I’d never killed 
anyone before.” 

“You hated him?” 

“Yes.” 

“Does anything ever excite you 
any more?" 

“No.” 

“How can you hate without 
getting excited?” 

She raised her hands in 
surrender, sat back and tried a 
smile. “Don’t cross-examine me, 
John. You’re supposed to be on 
my side. There’s no Adjudicator 
here to keep score.” 

He leaned back in his chair and 
started smoking again. He said 
nothing until the cigarette burned 
his fingers. He dropped the butt 
and said, “You want to spend the 
rest of your life in prison?" 

Sarah shook her head weakly. 
Nance had hoped to surprise her 
and had succeeded. But he had 
done more than that. He had 
frightened her. 

“What are you talking about?" 
Sarah said slowly. 

“There’s an old law dating back 
to the time of the death penalty 
that’s never been changed because 
there’s never been a real need to 
change it. The laws states that any- 
one pleading guilty to first-degree 
murder will be sentenced to life 
imprisonment without benefit 



118 



GALAXY 




of parole or treatment. There 
can’t be any treatment because no 
evidence has been offered in court 
by which to determine the type 
and degree of treatment. Only 
two kinds of people ever plead 
guilty to murder, anyway mad- 
men and fools. If you’re one of 
them and want to plead guilty 
they’ll lock you inside a battle- 
worn prison and throw the key in 
the ocean." 

Sarah had been listening to him 
with total attention, nodding 
slowly. 

Nance said, “I’ll ask my 
question one more time: Do you 
want to spend the rest of your nat- 
ural life in a prison cell?’’ 

Sarah laughed sharply, then said 
softly, “God, no.” 

“You’re going to plead innocent 
then.” 

“There's no way to get around 
this law?” 

“None at all. The law's the law, 
Sarah.” 

“Then I’ll do as you say.” 

“Good.” Nance settled back in 
his chair and smiled at Sarah. “I'm 
happy to see you again,” he said. 

“Under these circumstances?” 

“Under any circumstances. It’s 
good.” 

Sarah smiled back at him. 
“You’re looking fine, John.” 

“I’m feeling fine. It’s living out 
in the country away from all this 
bustle and noise that does it. It’s 
enough to take ten bad years off a 
man’s life. You ought to give it a 



try yourself. Find yourself a few 
acres. You might have to go all the 
way to Alaska, but you can find 
some if you look. Build yourself a 
small house and live there. Once 
you’ve tried it you’ll never want to 
see a city again.” 

She was still smiling at him, but 
the smile was tinged with irony 
now, as though she were laughing 
inwardly at a private joke. 

Softly. Nance said, “What was 
the nature of the work you and 
Oakes were doing?” 

The smile faded and Sarah said, 
“1 can’t tell you that.” 

“Top secret ?” 

“Very.” 

“Secrets aren’t going to do you 
any good when they start cutting 
at your brain.” 

“They don’t do that, John. It’s 
treatment.” 

“Treatment that turns people 
into cows,” he said and rose to his 
feet. He dusted his suit and 
straightened his tie. “Filthy 
places, jails. Man of my age ought 
not to hang around them.” 

“You’re leaving now?” 

“Got a few things to do,” he 
said, moving toward the door. He 
rapped forcefully and heard the 
guard shuffling toward him. 
Then, wheeling his bulk, he turned 
on Sarah. “Oakes killed himself,” 
he said. 

Sarah blurted, “No.” 

“What I thought,” Nance said. 
The guard arrived and let him 
out.

II 

N ance established himself at 
the old Parks Hotel on Marshall 
Street off Reed Avenue. He was 
happy to see that, it hadn’t changed 
much over the years. The windows 
were fully as filthy as ever. The 
carpet was worn and soiled. Dust 
floated through the air in steady 
rivers. The mattress was as hard 
as a rock. 

Nance was lying on the bed, 
smoking a cigarette and trying to 
find a comfortable position 
when the knock came. 

“Willy?” he asked. 

“Yes, sir, Mr. Nance.” 

“Door’s open.” 

Nance did not move to greet his 
visitor. Willy was a pallid little 
man of indeterminate age, 
slouched stance and a suit three 
sizes too big for him. 

“Been a long time,” Willy said, 
approaching the bed. “I’ve missed 
you, Mr. Nance.” 

“Missed you, too, Willy. There’s 
liquor on the shelf over the sink.” 
“Never touch it any more, Mr. 
Nance. Stuffs bad for the heart, 
you know.” 

“You still work, however? You 
haven’t relinquished that pleasure 
for the good of your heart ?” 

“No, sir. Still on the job.” 
“Good.” Nance rolled on his 
side so that he faced Willy. “I want 
information about three people 
in particular. One is my client, 
Sarah Bigelow. Another is the 



victim, Jeffrey Oakes. The third 
is a man named Karlton Cabot. 
He's chief project officer at Re- 
search Associates Incorporat- 
ed, where both Sarah and Oakes 
worked before the trouble. I want 
every scrap you can find on all 
three of them, going back twenty, 
thirty years.” 

Willy made notes in a small pad. 
“This might not be as easy as it 
sounds. The government is 
touchy about people asking cer- 
tain questions.” 

“You’ll get around them, Willy. 
I have the greatest confidence in 
your abilities. Now, my second re- 
quest: I want you to find out every- 
thing you can about the project 
Oakes and Sarah were working 
on. It’s called Project Lazarus, a 
bit of information I had to pry 
teeth apart in order to obtain. And 
it’s all the information I have, 
too. If you can find one bit more 
I’ll pay you a five-hundred-dollar 
bonus.” 

“Anything else?” 

“For the moment, no.” 

Willy pocketed his notebook and 
allowed himself a wry grin. “It’s 
good working for you again, Mr. 
Nance. It’s like twenty years ago 
when we were on top of it all.” 
“We’re still on top, Willy.” 
“Sure, Mr. Nance, of course. 
You were always the best. You got 
killers off that scared me to look 
at.” 

“It was my job, Willy, same as 
your job is putting your nose into 



120 



GALAXY 




places it doesn’t properly belong.” 
Willy’s grin enlarged. “You were 
always an honest man, Mr. 
Nance.” 

“We’re two of a kind, Willy. 
That’s why we work so well togeth- 
er.” Nance laughed and waved at 
the air. “Look at us, dressed like 
two mummies in a dusty museum. 
We should have died ten years ago 
and let them stuff us.’'^ 

“You keep smoking that tobac- 
co and you’re going to be dead.” 

“A detective, Willy. Keep that in 
mind. You’re a detective and not a 
doctor. Please keep your healthful 
hints to yourself.” 

Willy chuckled. “You always 
were sensitive about those ciga- 
rettes.” 

“I’ll be in touch, Willy.” 

“Right.” Willy turned toward 
the door and took a step. He 
paused when he spotted a softcov- 
er book lying face-up on the car- 
pet. 

"Red Harvest'V' he said. “You’re 
really taking this farming life seri- 
ous.” " ' 

"Red Harvest," Nance said, em- 
phasizing the first word. “Red, as 
in blood. It’s murder that I’m tak- 
ing seriously, Willy. Red, as in 
death.” 

T he uniformed guard jumped 
forward and blocked the man’s 
progress. “Do you have a pass, 
sir?” he asked. The guard was a 
young man, barely out of his 
teens, who wore a light fringe of 



red mustache on his upper lip. At 
his waist he carried a gun. “You 
have to have one to pass this 
point.” 

Nance made a motion to push 
the boy aside, then thought better 
of it when he saw the hand reach 
for the weapon. 

“Hold on,” Nance said. “I’m 
too old to get shot. I want to see 
Karlton Cabot. A surprise visit.” 

“1 can’t let you through,” the 
guard said, “not without a pass.” 
Nance tried another tack. “Is 
there anything top secret about a 
man’s office?” 

“I have my orders.” 

“What if I were to scream?” 
“Sir?” 

“I said, ‘What if I were to 
scream?’ What if I were to stand 
right here in front of you, scream- 
ing at the very top of my lungs, un- 
til you agreed to pick up that phone 
and tell your boss that John Mill- 
burn Nance is here, that Nance 
pays his taxes and that Nance 
wants to see him?” 

The guard shook his head. 
“You’re kidding.” 

“Nope.” 

“Well, I guess it won’t hurt to 
call him.” 

“If you don’t I’ll scream.” As 
proof, Nance gave a shrill yelp. 

The guard reached quickly for 
the phone and dialed a number. 

N ance walked through the 
doorway, glaring at the letter- 
ing on the door that proclaimed.

DEFENDER OF DEATH 




Karlton Cabot, Research Di- 
rector, No Admittance. He 
slammed the door behind him. He 
faced the man he had come to see. 
Cabot was a distinguished man of 
about forty, whasat primly behind 
a hardwood desk, his hands firm- 
ly folded. 

Without preamble Nance said, 
“I don’t like your security 
system.” He was angry. He had 
wanted to arrive unannounced. 

Cabot grinned widely and waved 
a hand. Nance looked around for a 
chair solid enough to support his 
bulk, but the room was devoid of 
spare furniture. 

“There's no need for you to sit," 
Cabot said. “You won’t be staying 
that long.” 

“1 have some questions.” 
“Which 1 cannot answer be- 
cause they violate security regu- 
lations. Correct?” 

“Is your security worth the price 
of someone’s life?” 

“Quite often it is worth the price 
of many lives. But 1 don’t think 
that’s pertinent in this instance.” 
“To me treatment meted to con- 
victed murders is no better than 
death.” 

“1 don’t want to argue meta- 
physics with you, Nance. If that’s 
all you have to say, I wish you’d 
leave. I’m a busy man.” 

Nance began to pace the length 
of the small office, forcing Cabot 
to follow him with his eyes. Nance 
said, “Do you know why he killed 
himself?” 



“Who killed himself?” 

“How about Jeffrey Oakes?” 
“Oh." Cabot grinned and 
clenched his fists tighter. “So 
that’s going to be your defense. It 
won’t work. Sarah confessed. 
Have you forgotten that?” 

“The confession was given under 
the shock of the moment. She in- 
tends to withdraw it.” 

“I heard her make it,” Cabot 
said. “She was cold as ice at the 
time.” 

“You were here the night Oakes 
died?” 

“I was. I’ve never denied it. I ar- 
rived outside about ten minutes 
later. Sarah was confessing to the 
patrolman.” 

“What’s Project Lazarus?" 
Nance asked and stopped pacing 
long enough to Watch an expres- 
sion of astonishment cross 
Cabot’s face. It was gone as quick- 
ly as it had come. Nance resumed 
pacing. 

Cabot said, “I don’t know what 
you’re talking about.” 

“You will — and soon. I’m going 
to haul you into court, Cabot, you 
and the man who gives you your 
orders. There’s one bit of infor- 
mation I’m going to give you in 
advance: Benson versus State of 
New Hampshire. All classified 
information essential to reach- 
ing a decision must be revealed. 
The case, in turn, takes on the 
classification of the material 
concerned. But the information 
is revealed; both sides know it. I 



122 



GALAXY 




haven’t the least hesitation about 
turning this into a top-secret mur- 
der trial.” 

“But there’s nothing about Laz- 
arus that has a bearing on your 
case. Nothing.” 

“That’s easy enough for you to 
say, Cabot. You know that and 
your boss knows that — but me: I’m 
just a poor hick farmer with an in- 
terest in the law. I don’t even know 
what Lazarus is about. Until I 
find out. I’ve got to act under the 
assumption that it does have a 
bearing, however tenuous, on my 
client’s case.” 

“Ask her to tell you. She 
knows.” 

“I’m asking you, Cabot.” 

“And I’m telling you Sarah mur- 
dered Oakes for purely personal 
reasons.” 

“Cabot, Cabot.” Nance sighed 
and stopped himself in the center of 
the room. “Sarah Bigelow never 
killed anyone in her life. You 
know that as well as I do. Don’t lie 
to me.” 

He went for the door and jerked 
it open. “Your boss has twelve 
hours in which to agree to answer 
my questions. Otherwise I’ll see 
you in court.” 

“You can’t threaten me,” Cab- 
ot said. “Go to hell.” 

“It’s not you I’m threatening. I 
thought I made that clear. 1 don’t 
threaten the little ones like you. 1 
hunt big game.” 

Nance went out and hurried 
down the corridor, grinning 



happily. He swept past the guard, 
nodded at the man and continued 
toward the street. 

“An excellent move,” he mut- 
tered to himself. “Classic strategy. 
Ought to keep them busy, busy.” 

And: “Benson versus State of 
New Hampshire. Indeed. Oh, 
Lord, indeed.” 

Nance slid into the seat of his 
helicar and laughed at the face 
that greeted him, grinning wildly, 
from the rearview mirror. 

N ance glared at the machine. 

Sitting behind a narrow table, 
his client at his side — the machine 
covering the opposite wall and go- 
ing beep and shiver, hum and click 
— Nance frowned, stared. He did 
not like any machine of any sort, 
but his special and particular rage 
was reserved for this one. The Ad- 
judicator had gone into operation 
eight years ago. The fact had only 
confirmed the rightness of Nance’s 
previous decision to retire. 

The Adjudicator had taken the 
place of human judges and juries in 
major criminal proceedings. Civil 
cases and minor criminal actions 
were still handled in the old way, 
but whenever a crime was serious 
enough to warrant treatment for 
its perpetrator, the Adjudicator 
was wheeled into court and put to 
work. A nine-man special court of 
appeals automatically reviewed 
all Adjudicated verdicts, but not 
once — not once in eight years — had 
there been an overruling. 



DEFENDEROF DEATH 



123 




Within the maze of its circuitry, 
the Adjudicator housed the entire 
known body of legal information, 
both statutory and common, and 
that extra-legal knowledge — such 
as psychology, sociology, and his- 
tory — that mighty be required in or- 
der to arrive at a proper decision. 
For eight years these circuits had 
hummed and clicked, and not once 
had they been wrong. 

Such infallibility was not (of 
course) human. 

And so; Nance glared. 

A young man wearing bright 
blue coveralls who stood at the side 
of the Adjudicator cleared his 
throat and called the court to or- 
der. City versus Sarah Bigelow. 
Murder in the First Degree. 

While the formalities continued, 
Nance glanced around the room. It 
was nearly empty of life. There was 
the defense table, with himself 
and Sarah present. The prose- 
cutor’s table was occupied by City 
Attorney Frank Larrabie and 
two young assistants — and there 
was the young man in the cov- 
eralls. But these were all. There 
were no spectators or newsmen. 
Odd, Nance thought. 

The young man had turned to 
Nance. “Flow does the defendent 
plead?” 

Nance rose to his feet, delib- 
erately dusted his vest and looked - 
at the man. “Who are you?” he 
asked, in a sharp, clear voice. 

“I’m the expert — John Anders.” 

“I see.” Nance stroked his stom- 



ach. “You are in charge of this 
machine?” 

“More or less,” Anders said. 
“But how do you plead?” 

“One moment. I’ve been in re- 
tirement for the past ten years, as 
you may know. This is my first 
machine-age trial. Fd like to get u 
few things straight. Can this thing 
speak?” 

“Of course it can,” Anders said. 
“It is a fully equipped Adjudica- 
tor. But 1 usually handle these first 
details.” 

“1 see,” Nance said. He sat 
down, waved a hand and said, 
“Not guilty.” 

Anders turned toward Larrabie. 
“Prosecution’s case?” 

L ARRABI E came to his feet and 
approached the machine. He 
spoke directly to it, stating his case 
in plain, simple terms, telling ex- 
actly what he intended to prove. 
Nance listened attentively, less to 
Larrabie’s words than to his tone 
and manner. He had hoped to pick 
up a pointer or two from Larra- 
bie’s presentation, but heard noth- 
ing but a dry, recital of facts. Lar- 
rabie’s stated his arguments in 
clear and unemotional terms. 
There was no cry for retribution 
and punishment. Sarah Bigelovs 
had murdered Jeffrey Oakes. He. 
Larrabie, had proof of this. He 
would present his proof to the 
Adjudicator and allow the machine 
to act upon it. 

Larrabie Finished and called his 



124 



GALAXY 




first witness. This was a city med- 
ical examiner named Blaine, who 
had performed an autopsy on the 
deceased. 

Blaine, a little man whose feet 
barely touched the floor from a 
sitting position, testified that 
Oakes had been administered a 
quantity of the drug HTC 
sufficient to kill him. Oakes had a 
known history of allergies to cer- 
tain drugs, including HTC. The 
dosage had been taken internally 
and had killed him within fifteen 
or twenty minutes, as soon as it 
reached his heart. 

When Blaine finished the Adju- 
dicator spoke for the first time. 
The voice came from the center of 
the machine and said, “Cross-ex- 
amination, Mr. Nance?” 

Nance stood up. The voice had 
been masculine and clear, with a 
definite sense of warmth and hu- 
manity to it. Nance wondered how 
this had been managed. The best 
way to get a public to accept a cold 
and unemotional machine would be 
to provide it with an attitude of 
warmth and human kindness. 

Nance stood in front of Blaine, 
blocking the man’s view of the rest 
of the room, and said, “1 under- 
stand Mr. Oakes drank the HTC 
solution in a cup of coffee.” 

“Coffee was found in his stom- 
ach,” Blaine said. “That is cor- 
rect.” 

“Don’t most people fix and pour 
their own coffee?” 

“I suppose so,” Blaine said. 



Nance turned quickly and 
glanced at Larrabie, but the prose- 
cuting attorney did not appear to 
be listening. 

Nance shrugged and said, “Your 
report stated that murder was the 
most obvious possibility. Why 
murder, 1 want to ask. Why not 
suicide?” 

“There was no evidence of sui- 
cide. Nor motive.” 

“No motive?” Nance assumed 
an expression of mock astonish- 
ment. “I’m an old man,” he said, 
“and 1 can easily think of a dozen 
reasons why 1 ought to kill myself. 
And I’m a very stable man, on the 
record. Isn’t it highly unlikely that 
Mr. Oakes was totally without 
motive for taking his own life?” 

In past trials he had known 
Nance would never have been al- 
lowed to introduce such a doubtful 
argument without opposition. 
He felt himself pausing for the 
objection, but it never came. The 
Adjudicator flashed and hummed. 
Larrabie sat at his table, staring 
into space. 

Blaine said, “1 really can’t say. 
I’m no philosopher.” 

“Thank you.” 

Nance returned to his seat. 
Larrabie then called two indivi- 
duals to the stand who had wit- 
nessed Jeffrey Oakes’s actual 
death. The first was a partolman, 
who testified that Oakes had ap- 
proached him, stumbling, had 
collapsed at his feet and died be- 
fore medical aid could arrive. 



DEFENDER OF DEATH 



125 




The second witness was a young 
girl who worked at RAI. She 
stated that she had seen Oakes fall, 
had gone to help him and had 
waited with the .partolman and 
several others foT an ambulance 
to arrive. Neither witness had 
heard Oakes speak before he died. 
Nance cross-examined the girl. 
“You say that Mr. Oakes said 
nothing in your hearing. In your 
opinion, could he have spoken?” 

“I think so,” the girl said. “He 
mumbled and moaned a lot.” 

“Then he could have spoken?” 

“I guess so.” 

“Then, I wonder. If he had been 
murdered, if he knew the identity 
of his killer, why didn’t he speak? 
Sarah Bigelow. He could have 
named her in front of a half-dozen 
reliable witnesses.” 

The girl shrugged and said, 
“Maybe he was too busy dying.” 
Nance thanked her and turned 
away. 

He was, he knew, getting away 
with murder, but in this case, mur- 
der would not help him. The Ad- 
judicator knew the law. It would 
automatically disregard all illegal 
or irrelevant testimony. Nance 
could introduce the possibility of 
suicide all he wanted. The Adjudi- 
cator would consider it only if 
compelled to consider it. 

Nance felt hopeless. With a jury 
of men he had always known where 
he stood. He could tell by men’s 
and women’s expressions whether 
or not he was winning. But a ma- 



chine? How did you read the ex- 
pression on the face of a machine? 
What did the flashing lights mean? 
The harsh clicks? The dry hums? 

The next witness was Karlton 
Cabot. Under Larrabie’s question- 
ing he freely discussed the personal 
and professional jealousy that had 
existed between Sarah Bigelow and 
Jeffrey Oakes. 

Nance listened, tapped his 
fingernails and regarded the 
Adjudicator. 

Cabot talked for nearly an hour. 
At last, Nance was invited to cross- 
examine. 

He wasted no time. If he was go- 
ing to be allowed to get away with 
murder, he intended to take ad- 
vantage of the fact. 

H e approached Cabot and 

crowded close to him, not 
speaking. He peered down his 
nose at the sitting man and said, 
“What is Project Lazarus?” 

Cabot squirmed and Nance slid 
closer until the two men were near- 
ly touching. 

“You must answer the ques- 
tion,” said the Adjudicator. 

Nance grinned to himself and 
prodded the witness: “You are fa- 
miliar with a Project Lazarus?” 

“I am,” Cabot admitted. 

“Tell us what it is.” 

“A top-secret, government- 
sponsored research project which 
we are handling at RAI.” 

“You are in charge of this proj- 
ect?” 



126 



GALAXY 




“Of the research end of it, yes.” 
“Both Mr. Oakes and Miss 
Bigelow worked under you?” 

“That is correct ” 

“What was the nature of this re- 
search?” 

“That is classified.” 

“I am aware of that. 1 want to 
know what it is that is top-secret.” 
Cabot squirmed and looked 
wildly around for help. He found 
it. The Adjudicator began to hum 
like a bees’ nest gone mad. 

“This line of questioning in- 
fringes upon areas of national se- 
curity. I must ask you, Mr. Nance, 
to move into other areas.” 

“But 1 have to know,” Nance 
said. 

“It is not relevant.” 

“1 intend to prove differently — 
that it is of the utmost relevance.” 
“Mr. Nance, please,” said the 
Adjudicator softly, as though cor- 
recting a child. “Knowledge of the 
basic nature of this project is avail- 
able to me. 1 have studied it and 
assure you that it does not concern 
th is trial. Unless you can prove 
otherwise, I must insist that you 
pursue another line of question- 
ing.” 

Nance said, “Request an ad- 
journment.” 

“For what purpose?” 

“To gather evidence to show you 
that Tm right.” 

“1 will grant you an adjourn- 
ment until tomorrow.” 

“Thank you,” Nance said and 
returned to his table. “Damn it,” 



he told Sarah, “I can’t work with 
this slot machine.” 

“It doesn’t matter,” she said. 
“I’m guilty.” 

“That’s for me to decide,’’ 
Nance said and hurried out. 

Willy was waiting in the corri- 
dor. 

“How did it go?” he asked. “1 
couldn’t get in.” 

“Who kept you out?” 

"Federal guards. They kept 
everybody out.” 

Nance smiled. His threat had 
had some effect at least. “It was a 
bad day,” he said. “Project Laza- 
rus was declared officially irrele- 
vant.” 

“You still want to find out about 
it?” 

“Of course.” 

“Then come along to my office. 
1 finally found a guy who’s willing 
to talk.” 

“Who?” 

“Name’s Lawton. Says he’s a 
friend of Sarah’s.” 

“He worked on Project Laza- 
rus?” 

“He’s still working on it.” 

“What does he have to say?” 

“He won’t talk to me — unless 
you’re there. He says he doesn’t 
know me, that he’s heard of you.” 
“All right,” Nance said. “Let’s 
go.” 

HI 

H ad henry w. lawton 

not been sitting all alone in a 



DEFENDEROF DEATH 



127 




very large chair in the very center 
of a small but bare office, Nance 
might not have noticed him. Law- 
ton was that kind of man, one of 
those you pass a hundred times a 
day and whose face and features 
make less of an ijmpression than a 
stray grain of desert sand. 

Nance guessed that while Law- 
ton might well have been a friend 
of Sarah’s, she was not a friend of 
his. In fact, she had probably nev- 
er even noticed him. 

“She didn’t do it,’’ Lawton said 
as soon as Nance entered the of- 
fice. Lawton looked at the floor as 
he spoke. “She couldn’t have.” 

“Who couldn’t have done 
what?” Nance said. 

“Sarah couldn’t have killed Mr. 
Oakes. What do you think?” 

Nance continued forward, pulled 
up a chair and sat down. Willy 
remained on his feet. Lawton con- 
tinued to stare at the bare floor. 
Nance kept silent. At last Lawton 
looked at him. 

“Aren’t you interested in what I 
have to say?” 

“Of course I am, Mr. Lawton. 
I’m merely allowing you to tell 
your story in your own good time.” 

“I won’t have to testify? This 
will be strictly between you and 
me?” 

“Of course,” Nance said. He 
was using a new voiee, one that was 
nearly identical to that used by the 
Adjudicator. Nance like his new 
voice. “Tell me about Project 
Lazarus. What is it?” 



“What do you think?” 

“I’m asking you, Mr. Lawton.” 
“Lazarus. The Bible. It has to do 
with making people live forever.” 
Nance nodded slowly, as if he 
had known all along. 

“That’s what Oakes was. He was 
immortal.” 

“He was until someone mur- 
dered him.” 

“Nobody murdered him. He 
killed himself.” 

Willy interrupted. “A man who 
can live forever and he kills — ” 

“He was crazy,” Lawton said. 
His eyes went back to the floor and 
he spoke rapidly. “1 overheard 
him and Sarah talking a hundred 
times or more. She was going to 
be the next one, the next im- 
mortal. One more operation 
and . Anyway, he kept telling 
her not to go through with it — and 
he was always arguing with Cabot 
and the others. He said they had 
destroyed his soul. He said he 
could see heaven and it was a 
glorious place and now he’d never 
get there. He was doomed to live 
forever on Earth. In hell, he called 
it.” 

“So you think he killed himself. 
So that he could get to heaven.” 
“He talked about it all the time. 
I heard him say he couldn’t stand 
to look at heaven all day, knowing 
he’d never get there. They all knew 
he was crazy. At one time they 
were going to lock him up — but 
they were afraid of that, too.” 

“It doesn’t make sense to me,” 



128 



GALAXY 




Willy said. “Try handing me im- 
mortality and I’ll show you what to 
do with it.” 

“Don’t get the idea I ^nean 1 
have definite proof he killed him- 
self,” Lawton said. “I don’t. In 
fact — I didn’t think of this before, 
but Cabot might have killed him. 
Or any of them. They were all 
afraid of him.” 

“Why were they afraid of him?” 
Nance said. 

“Well, why do you think? They 
had everything tied up in this pro- 
ject. All sorts of government peo- 
ple were watching the program to 
see what would come of it. Every- 
body would like to be able to opt to 
live forever — even me — and here’s 
the first immortal — Oakes — and 
he goes around talking about 
heaven and suicide. Sure, they 
didn’t like it.” 

“Cabot didn’t do it,” Willy said. 
“I checked. Sarah was the only one 
it could have been — unless he did it 
himself.” 

“Then he did,” Lawton said, 
flatly. He looked right at Willy. 
“Sarah could never kill anyone." 

“I’m sure of that, too,” Nance 
said. “And as for you Mr. Law- 
ton, I want to tell you how much 
we appreciate your coming here. 
You may very well have saved our 
case for us.” 

Lawton rose to his feet, happy to 
take the hint, and walked toward 
the door. He stopped, looked at the 
floor and said, “I sure hope it 
works out,” and left. 



Nance folded his hands in his lap 
and sat quietly. Willy took the 
chair Lawton had vacated and 
flopped down. 

At last Nance asked, “Where 
did you find him?” 

“At home,” Willy said. “I man- 
aged to get a list of people work- 
ing on the project. I poked around 
in their lives and found Lawton. He 
was dying to talk, but only to you.” 
“A very sensible man.” 

“Don’t tell me — you believe 
him.” 

“In part I do. It makes sense. 
Some of it. What else could Pro- 
ject Lazarus be? And there have 
been rumors. Yes, I think I do be- 
lieve him.” 

“But it doesn’t really prove any- 
thing, does it?” 

“What do you mean, Willy?” 
“Look here, Mr. Nance. I’ve 
been thinking about what Lawton 
said. There’s still no reason why 
Sarah couldn’t have killed him. 
Oakes went crazy. He was endan- 
gering the project, maybe prevent- 
ing her from achieving immortal- 
ity. That gives her plenty of mo- 
tive for murder. It makes good 
sense, too.” 

“Yes,” Nance said carefully. “It 
does, doesn’t it?” 

“So, what are you going to do 
now?” 

“I’m going back to my hotel, 
draw a hot bath, sit in it, read a 
good book. Tomorrow I’ll see you 
in court.” 

“The won’t let me in.”

“They will now. I’m sure they’ve 
found out all they need to know 
about Benson and the State of New 
Hampshire.’’ 

“New Hampshire — huh? What 
are you talking al?out?’’ 

“Nothing, Willy,’’ Nance said. 
“Nothing at all.” 

N ance sat at the defense table, 
his fingers tapping a rhythm, his 
eyes focused into space. Willy was 
seated ta^his right; Sarah- to the 
right of Willy. Nance tried his best 
to ignore a steady stream of prose- 
cution testimony that first pro- 
vided Sarah Bigelow with a motive 
and then established her oppor- 
tunity to kill. 

Nance had decided to quit living 
in the past. If he wanted to win this 
case he would have to stop acting 
as if the time were twenty years 
ago. The Adjudicator did not care 
if he was alert and quick. It could 
not be swayed by an emotional ap- 
peal to the heart. The machine was 
only interested in facts. Well, 
Nance had a few of those up his 
sleeve. And his time was drawing 
near. 

The prosecution droned on. 
Morning became noon and noon 
turned into early evening. At four 
o’clock Larrabie wrapped up his 
case with a final summation that 
was notable only for its blandness. 
Ten years ago it would have put the 
best juries to sleep. But not the 
Adjudicator. Larrabie knew what 
he was doing. The machine ap- 



peared to listen intently, sifting fact 
from theory, waiting for the last 
flat languid phrase to fall from 
Larrabie’s lips. 

When it had done so the Ad- 
judicator said immediately, “Mr. 
Nance — you may present your case 
now.” 

Nance stood slowly and walked 
into the open part of the court- 
room. Looking at Larrabie, he 
said, “I'd like to make a brief 
statement, then request an ad- 
journment.” 

“It is late,” the Adjudicator 
said, at his back. “You may pro- 
ceed.” 

Nance kept looking at Larrabie. 
He refused to talk directly to a 
machine. Larrabie and his assis- 
tants would have to do. 

“I intend,” Nance said, “to show 
my client’s innocence by a method 
that is, I believe, without prece- 
dent. I intend to prove her lack of 
guilt on the grounds that Jeffrey 
Oakes is not, in actuality, dead.” 

Nance peered closely at Larra- 
bie, but the man’s face was with- 
out expression. 

Nance said, “Jeffrey Oakes is 
not dead. In his own fashion, he is 
as much alive as Mr. Larrabie here 
-or myself. I intend to show that 
he is happy where he is and that my 
client has not committed an 
antisocial act. 

“I intend to ignore the question 
of whether she actually caused 
Jeffrey Oakes to leave this plane of 
existence. The evidence presented 



130 



GALAXY 




by the prosecution is both weak 
and circumstantial but, frankly, I 
have nothing that contradicts it. 
What I do intend to show is that 
Sarah Bigelow is not in need of 
treatment. The act of murder, in 
this case, is not antisocial. That is 
what I intend to prove.” 

Nance was relieved as Larrabie 
jumped to his feet and said, “I ob- 
ject to this entire line of argument. 
This is the biggest pile of nonsense 
I’ve heard in my life.” 

Nance turned to the Adjudica- 
tor and waited. The machine said, 
“Mr. Nance, I would like you to 
explain your arguments further. 
All my data insists that murder is 
an antisocial act under any cir- 
cumstances.” 

“I’ll be glad to,” Nance said. He 
turned again, so that he faced 
Larrabie. “Since the dawn of time 
man has speculated about the pos- 
sibility of life after death, about 
immortality in one form or an- 
other. Nearly all religions have 
been based on the concept that a 
conscious spirit of some sort, sur- 
vives after the death of the body. I 
intend to show that Jeffrey Oakes 
not only believed this, but that he 
knew it to be true. Whoever caused 
his death was only supplying him 
with the means by which to reach 
another plane of existence. Oakes 
wanted to go there. Putting him 
there was not an antisocial act.” 

“Do you intend,” asked the Ad- 
judicator, “to prove that there are 
other levels of existence?” 



“I intend to show the likelihood 
of it. Within your data banks there 
is. I’m sure, a great deal of infor- 
mation on this subject.” 

“There is,” the machine said. 

“1 intend, then, to use this in- 
formation, plus that which I can 
present here, in order to show that 
Jeffrey Oakes is living on another 
plane of existence.” 

“This will be tomorrow?” 

“Yes. I’d like an adjournment 
now.” 

“Fine. I shall be anticipating to- 
morrow’s testimony. Court is ad- 
journed until ten o’clock tomor- 
row morning.” 

Nance strode back to his table 
and began piling papers into a neat 
stack. Sarah stepped past Willy 
and grabbed Nance by the sleeve. 

“John,” she said, “this is ridicu- 
lous.” 

“Don’t you believe in life after 
death, Sarah?” 

“I do not.” 

“But Oakes did.” 

“Whom have you been talking 
to, John?” 

“A friend of yours, ” he said. 
“John,” Sarah said, after a 
pause, “I want you to drop this.” 
“Why?” 

“I’m guilty.” 

“I know better than that.” 

“But there’s no need — ” 

“Will you talk to me?” he said. 
“Tell me everything. Tomorrow — 
before court.” 

“Yes,” she said, “if you pro- 
mise to drop this.” 



DEFENDEROF DEATH 



131 




“I can’t promise that until I’ve 
heard what you have to say.” He 
tucked his papers under his arm 
and waved at Willy. “See you to- 
morrow,” he told Sarah. 



N ance, facing Sarah through 
the glass, folded his hands and 
waited for the guard to depart. 

When they were alone Nance 
still waited for Sarah to speak first. 

She said tentatively, “You won’t 
give it up? You won’t just go home 
and let me alone?” 

“I can’t do it,” Nance said, 
“even if I wanted to. I took your 
case because I wanted to take your 
case. I’m going to win your case 
because I’ve never learned how to 
act any other way and I’m too 
damned old to change.” 

“How much do you know?” she 
said. 

“Nearly all of it. I know about 
Lazarus, if that’s what you mean.” 
“Who told you?” 

“It doesn’t matter.”. 

She sighed. “All right. I saw him 
put the pills in his coffee. He didn’t 
try to hide it from me. I watched 
him drink, then he tried to leave. I 
wanted to stop him but he knocked 
me down. He wanted to die in 
public. And he did.” 

“Why?” 

“He wanted to bring the project 
down with him. He was crazy. He 
knew if he died in the laboratory, 
we’d hush it up, call it a heart 
failure, so he went outside. The 



first immortal— and he killed him- 
self.” 

“And then?” 

“So he was dead — and there was 
no way to hush it up. Four people 
saw him die. The patrolman called 
an ambulance. I went out and 1 
said I’d killed him.” 

“To save your project?” 

“Yes, tb save it. They all under- 
stood. They told me to go ahead 
and take the blame — they’d fix it 
up. I’ll be convicted, yes, that’s the 
idea, but then I’ll be sent to a treat- 
ment hospital, one operated by 
RAI. They run several of them. I’ll 
be held a year — five years — ten — 
how many it takes to complete the 
project. Then I’ll come out. Free 
and immortal.” 

“Then this trial means nothing?” 
“It means confirmation that 
Jeffrey was murdered. Murder is 
fine, but not suicide.” 

Nance nodded thoughtfully. 
“Have you ever considered the pos- 
sibility that Oakes was right?” 
“About the heaven he saw?” 
“Yes.” 

“He was mad,” she said firmly. 
“I intend to prove otherwise.” 
She jumped and her fingernails 
hit the glass. Her face twisted and 
her jaws clenched. 

“Sarah,” he said, “sit down.” 

She sat. 

Nance said, “I’m a defense law- 
yer. Years ago I set men free who 
weren’t fit to burn in hell. But I did 
my job. I defended them to the best 
of my ability. I’m going to do the 



132 



GALAXY 




same for you. 1 can't help it. I’m 
going to get you off.” 

“No!” But she did not move. 
“Yes,” Nance said. And: “I’m 
sorry.” 

She said, “No,” again, but soft- 
ly, and began to cry. 

Nance said, “People live too 
long as it is.” He went to the door, 
knocked, and the guard let him 
out. 

N ance was late. He walked 
hurriedly into the courtroom, 
Willy at his heels, and took his 
seat. When Sarah saw him she 
turned away and stared at the wall. 
Nance sighed, shuffled a handful of 
papers and tried to look inscruta- 
ble. 

The Adjudicator said, “Court 
has already been called to order in 
your absence, Mr. Nance. Would 
you care now to continue from the 
point at which we adjourned yes- 
terday?” 

Nance nodded at the papers in 
his hand, said, “Gladly.” 

He walked slowly across the 
room, glancing occasionally at the 
papers. He stopped when he 
reached Larrabie and looked at the 
man. 

“Ed like to begin,” Nance said, 
“by introducing into evidence all of 
the information contained within 
the data banks of the Adjudicator 
pertaining to life after death or 
Project Lazarus.” 

“That will be done,” said the 
Adjudicator. 



Larrabie glared at Nance and 
stood. “One moment,” he said. “I 
believe 1 have the right to examine 
all evidence used in arriving at a 
verdict.” 

“That is correct,” the Adjudica- 
tor said. 

“Well, I don’t have it. I don’t 
know what you know about life af- 
ter death. I don’t know a thing 
about Project Lazarus.” 

“If you wish, a printout will be 
prepared containing my knowledge 
of life after death. I would esti- 
mate that such a printout will run 
to a couple billion words.” 

“That won’t be necessary,” Lar- 
rabie said. 

“As for Project Lazarus, as you 
know, it is classified top secret. 
Two days ago, I ruled against its 
direct relevance in this case. That 
ruling is still in effect. However, if 
Mr. Nance wishes me to consider 
the nature of the project in arriv- 
ing at my final verdict, that can be 
done without the necessity of di- 
rect testimony. My knowledge of 
the project would appear to be 
quite complete.” 

“Good,” Nance said, as Larra- 
bie sat. Rubbing his hands togeth- 
er, Nance requested that his first 
witness be produced. Her name 
was Anna May Nelson. 

A guard brought her into the 
courtroom. She was a small, 
stooped old woman who wore a 
long black gown and a veil that 
covered her eyes. She took a chair 
near the Adjudicator, facing both 



DEFENDEROF DEATH

tables, and folded her hands in her 
lap. The Adjudicator’s expert 
swore her to the oath. 

The preliminaries over, Nance 
stood in front of the woman and 
faced Larrabie. “Anna May Nel- 
son,” Nance saidt “is an expert on 
the subject of life after death, 
which is why I have called her to 
testify in behalf of the. defense. She 
is a medium, one who can contact 
and speak with the dead. At the 
present time she is in direct touch 
with Jeffrey Oakes. I intend to 
question Mr. Oakes through Mrs. 
Nelson." 

Larrabie's lips pantomimed. Oh, 
my God b\i\. he said nothing 
aloud. 

Smiling, Nance turned to the 
witness. Her eyes were focused on 
empty space. Her mind seemed en- 
gaged elsewhere. 

Nance said, “Can you hear me 
clearly, Mrs. Nelson?” 

“Yes, sir,” the woman said. Her 
voice was soft, as though it came 
from a long distance. “But it is 
loud — the noise — a humming — too 
loud.” 

Nance looked at the Adjudica- 
tor and raised an eyebrow. The ma- 
chine stilled, fell silent, neither 
humming nor clicking. Nance 
turned back to his witness. 

“Mrs. Nelson," he said, “1 
would like to speak to Jeffrey 
Oakes. Is this possible?” 

A lengthy pause ensued. Sounds 
came from the woman’s throat, 
few of them more than audible. 



none of them words. Nance looked 
around the courtroom. Larrabie 
and his assistants were listening, 
totally involved, on the edges of 
their seats. Sarah still faced the 
wall. The Adjudicator waited si- 
lently. 

A t last a voice said, “1 am 
Jeffrey Oakes.” The tone was 
firm and decisive. Sarah's head 
jerked up and her mouth opened. 

“And I, Mr. Oakes, am John 
Millburn Nance. I am speaking to 
you from Municipal Courtroom 
Number Seven. Every word you 
say can be heard by an Adjudica- 
tor. I want you to know this. I am 
an attorney. 1 am acting in behalf 
of Miss Sarah Bigelow who has 
been charged in connection with 
your death.” 

The voice laughed sharply. An- 
na Nelson’s body shook and quiv- 
ered. 

“Why do you laugh, Mr. Oakes? 
Are you not dead?” 

“I am dead,” the voice said. 
“How does it feel to be dead?" 
Nance asked. 

“It feels better than ... I feel 
more truly alive than I’ve ever felt 
in my life." The voice laughed 
again, without any note of hyste- 
ia. 

“Could you describe for me and 
the court the world in which you 
now exist?” 

“I — no, I don’t think I can. Try 
describing your world to an amoe- 
ba.”

“But this world — it is one in 
which you consciously exist as 
Jeffrey Oakes?” 

“Yes, it is.” 

“And you have full memory of 
your previous life on Earth?” 

“I remember everything.” 

“I see.” Nance paused and swept 
his glance around the courtroom. 
Even Sarah, even Willy, everyone 
sat as silently as mice. 

“Your witness, Mr. Larrabie,” 
Nance said. 

Larrabie left his chair and ap- 
proached the witness. Nance stood 
nearby, listening, ready to inter- 
rupt if necessary. But no objec- 
tions were needed. Larrabie tried, 
but his heart was no longer in it. He 
asked the voice for Oakes’s birth- 
date and got it. He tried mother’s 
maiden name. Friends in college. 
Favorite food. Choice of tailor. 
The voice had an answer to each 
question. 

Larrabie threw up his hands. 
“This woman has obviously been 
coached or given a good biography 
of Oakes to read. But it means 
nothing.” 

“Ask her about Lazarus,” 
Nance suggested. “You won’t find 
that in any biographies.” 

“Ask her yourself.” Larrabie 
went back to his table and began 
whispering with his assistants. 

Nance asked that Karlton Cab- 
ot be returned to the stand. Cabot 
was brought in. Mrs. Nelson was 
led out. 

“How did Jeffrey Oakes feel 



about death?” Nance asked. He 
crowded close to the witness, so 
close that Cabot slid his chair back. 
Nance pressed closer yet and said, 
“Was he afraid of dying?” 

“No,” Cabot said. “He — ” 

“He welcomed it?” 

“I didn’t say that. I don’t know. 
How should I know?” 

Nance moved in. “Isn’t d 
that in the weeks immediately pro- 
ceeding his death Jeffrey Oakes 
was obsessed with the idea of 
death?” 

“You might say that,” Cabot 
said. “But the nature of Laza- 
rus — ” 

Nance cut him off with a wave. 
“1 would like to introduce into 
evidence,” he said, “a series ot 
statements made to a representa- 
tive of mine, before witnesses. 
These statements have to do with 
the attitudes of Jeffrey Oakes to- 
ward death. They were given by a 
group of his fellow employees at 
RAI, especially those who worked 
most closely with him im- 
mediately before his death. Let me 
read just one of these statements 
aloud. I believe it is representative 
of the rest.” . 

“Proceed,” said the Adjudica- 



LUl . 

Nance handed Larrabie all but 
one of the papers he carried in his 
hand. The remaining one he read 
aloud: “Jeffrey Oakes was a man 
consumed with the thought of 
death. He claimed that he could see 
heaven — and that he had also

found hell. Hell was on Earth, he 
said, and he welcomed the idea of 
death. He said he knew he would 
continue to live afterward. He 
made these statements all the time. 
I heard him say them to Karl Cab- 
ot and to Sarah Bigelow. It was the 
way he believed. I’d never met a 
man who wanted to die. Oakes was 
the first.” 

Nance handed this paper to Lar- 
rabie, then turned to Cabot. 
“Would you like to say something 
about this?” 

“All right,” Cabot said. “The 
statement is true. Oakes wanted to 
die.” 

“Thank you, Mr. Cabot. I have 
no more questions.” 

Larrabie refused to cross-ex- 
amine. Nance waited at his table 
until Cabot had been escorted from 
the room. Then he said, “The de- 
fense rests.” 

The Adjudicator, which had re- 
mained silent throughout Cabot’s 
testimony, returned abruptly to 
life, clicking and humming as 
though it were considering the 
meaning of life, which in a way it 
was. 

Nance grinned at Sarah and 
winked. 

She sighed and smiled at him. 

N ance sat alone in his room. 

He still wore his old suit — his 
courtroom suit, he called it — but he 
had removed his shoes. He stared 
at his naked toes and wiggled them, 
each in turn, from left to right. 



Nance was waiting for the ar- 
rival of his visitor. He was not sure 
of the man’s identity, positive only 
that he had to come. Nance sat un- 
comfortably in a hard-backed 
wooden chair. His feet rested on 
the bed. He smoked cigarette after 
cigarette, depositing the ashes 
neatly on the carpet. 

The remainder of the afternoon 
session had gone smoothly from 
Nance’s point of view. When Lar- 
rabie in his summation had scoffed 
at Anna Nelson, Nance had 
offered to produce an additional 
one dozen mediums. Larrabie had 
not risen to the bait. 

When his own turn arrived, 
Nance had acted quietly and 
unemotionally. He had stated his 
arguments as quickly as possible 
and returned to his seat. Sarah 
Bigelow had not committed a 
treatable act. She had merely 
moved Jeffrey Oakes, who wanted 
to be moved, from one plane of ex- 
istence to another. This was not, 
Nance had stated, an antisocial 
act. 

The Adjudicator’s verdict would 
not be revealed until the following 
morning. Both sides were always 
allowed one extra day in which to 
produce additional evidence or 
testimony. If nothing happened, 
both he and Larrabie would be 
given copies of the Adjudicator’s 
decision in the morning. It would 
be printed, final and irreversible. 

Nance lit another cigarette and 
coughed. The man had to come. 



136 



GALAXY 




Nance was tired of waiting. He 
wanted out of this city as quickly as 
possible. He got up to pace and 
thought about calling Willy. He 
forced himself to sit back down and 
decided he didn't feel like chatting. 
Somebody knocked on the door. 
Nance called, “Who is it?" 
“Karlton Cabot. I want to talk 
to you, Nance.” 

“Door’s open, Cabot.” 

But the man who entered the 
room was not Cabot. This man was 
small, fierce-looking, and wore a 
crewcut. He held a cigarette in his 
left fist. Nance lit another of his 
own. 

“What happened to Cabot?” 
Nance said. 

“I left him outside.” The man’s 
voice was firm and commanding. 
“I’m his supervisor— Clifton Rip- 
ley.” 

“Pleased to meet you,” Nance 
said. He didn’t move from his 
chair. 

“Can’t say the same,” Ripley 
said. He dropped on the bed and 
glared at Nance. “You’ve ruined a 
project into which I’ve put twenty 
years of my life.” 

“And saved a woman’s sanity.” 
“You know better than that, 
Nance. I’m sure she told you. She 
was only a diversion. Nothing 
would have happened to her.” 
Nance said, “Better tell me what 
you came to tell me, Ripley.” 

“You already know, don’t you? 
Larrabie has been instructed to 
present testimony tomorrow that 



proves Jeffrey Oakes killed him- 
self.” 

Nance nodded. 

“So, you’ve got what you want- 
ed,” Ripley said. “You knew we 
couldn’t call your bluff. A decision 
in this case — on your terms -could 
blow a hole right through what lit- 
tle stability this country has. That 
damned machine loves these little 
intellectual games. I could just see 
it. Every husband in the WHU who 
kills his wife tomorrow defends it 
on the grounds he was merely mov- 
ing her to a new and better plane. 
And vice versa. And — there’s 
precedent.” 

“It’s your machine,” Nance 
said. “A judge would have told me 
to shut my trap. When I brought 
that old woman into court he 
would’ve handed me six months for 
contempt.” 

“The Adjudicator,” Ripley said, 
“is like a child. It thinks like a ten- 
year-old prodigy and acts like 
one.” He crushed his cigarette on 
the carpet and rose to his feet. 
“Your reputation is clean, Nance. 
You haven’t lost a case. I hope this 
makes you happy.” 

Nance said nothing and Ripley 
went to the door. He put a hand on 
the knob, turned and said softly; 
“Why?” 

Nance shook his head. 

“You have something against 
immortality?” 

“If it makes men mad,” Nance 
said, “I do.” 

“But,” Ripley said, smiling

grimly, “it doesn't. 1 had known 
Oakes for twenty years. He was 
always a very unstable man. Bril- 
liant, yes. He had to be to head the 
project. But also unstable. And 
now the world wi|l know that he 
took his own life. We won't get 
another dime for Lazarus. It'll be 
filed away in somebody's vault. 
Top secret. Fifty years from now 
a hundred years — maybe some- 
body will duplicate our work. Man 
will be made free to live forever. 
But that won't mean much to you 
and me, will it, Nance? We'll both 
be Jn our graves." 

“Good night, Mr. Ripley," 
Nance said. 

“Good night." 

N ance did not attend the fol- 
lowing day's session. He did not 
want to see Sarah again. When he 
reached his home he called Willy. 
The information had been present- 
ed as Ripley had promised. Sarah 
had been set free. Oakes's death 
was officially regarded as a sui- 
cide. The Adjudicator's decision, 
whatever it had been, was gone, 
buried, erased, forgotten. The case 
against immortality was complete. 

Nance did not talk to his wife 
about the case. He sat at her side 
for an hour and told her about the 
city. Then he realized that he didn't 
want to talk about that, either. He 
fell silent, his mouth shut, and lis- 
tened to the parts beneath her 
blankets go click-hum-click. 

Where are you? he wanted to ask 



her. Are you still there? Am 1 
preventing you, like Oakes, from 
linding a better life elsewhere? Are 
you buried somewhere deep inside 
that mechanical monstrosity, 
waiting for the day when the switch 
is finally thrown and you can be 
free? 

Nance wanted to ask her these 
questions, but he did not. He was 
afraid that somehow she might an- 
swer. 

He reached down and gently 
drew the blankets away from the 
lower part of her body. He looked 
at the exposed parts and listened to 
them. Hum, they said evenly. 
Click, they added. Hum and 
click and click and hum. 

“I’m a lawyer,” he said. “I do 
not compromise. My clients are 
given the best possible defense un- 
der the law. Guilty, innocent, what- 
ever, my duty is to defend." 

He put the blankets back in 
place and smoothed the hair out of 
her eyes. It was too late for her. 
anyway. And too late for him as 
well. 

Nance stood up and walked 
outside. He strolled between the 
trees, looking at the blue sky, the 
pink clouds, the great white house 
in the distance. Nance moved 
through his own quiet world, but he 
moved alone. He would not visit 
her again today. Tomorrow would 
be soon enough to reestablish his 
routine. Today. Today, he wanted 
to live.

LETTERS 2 

of these two authors during one 
particular six-month period was 
entirely accidental — yet your com- 
ments on each helped to fill in the 
picture, as witness the following: 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

I would like to add a few obser- 
vations to my response to your 
poll. 

I can only assume that adverse 
reader reaction to stories printed 
in Galaxy led to the poll. [Not so 

the long-felt need for dialogue 
did. The December reader poll had 
been in the talking stage for a 
year. Ed.] / hope you will not 
let such immaturities guide you in 
the future selection and editing of 
stories. 

To deny certain aspects of hu- 
manity is to distort reality. This is 
an injustice to the reader. To use 
asterisks in a magazine intended 
for the ‘"most intelligent, shock- 
proof" etc., reader borders on the 
ludicrous and is a contradiction in 
terms. 

Admittedly / found I Will Fear 
No Evil offensive, not because of 
its emphasis on sex, however. The 
novel is badly written, poorly plot- 
ted ... an insult to the intelligence. 

On the other hand, Silverberg's 
Urbmon series has sexual scenes 
that are handled with great skill 
and are meaningful.

The December poll results are 
still coming in and are being tabu- 
lated. As this goes into print, the 
overwhelming majority view is

N ext year publishers with 
Christmas gift books in the 
works should probably send me 
galleys or manuscript copies or 
something- by July. Otherwise 
they’ll be in the dubious position 
now enjoyed here by Chelsea 
House, purveyors of the excel- 
lent The Pulps, an inch-thick, 8 Vi x 
II, copiously and expertly il- 
lustrated $15.00 nostalgic an- 
thology edited by Tony Good- 
stone. Sam Moskowitz gets credit 
as “Research Consultant." 
Christine E. Haycock, M.D. 
(Mrs. Moskowitz) did the out- 
standing color photography of 
magazine covers from the fa- 
mous Moskowitz collection. 

Almost everything about this 
book is top-drawer. Chelsea 
House’s production job merits 
an even higher price-tag, consid- 
ering the engraving costs and the 



enamel stock required to include 
that signatureful of cover re- 
productions. It’s really a fine 
thing. I hope those of you who 
grew up in the days when news- 
stands were nearly hidden under 
garish shingles of products like 
Wild West Weekly, Thrilling 
Wonder and Jungle Stories got 
one during the gift-giving tide. If 
not, I hope you can still find one 
for yourself now that the daisies 
are up. 

Goodstone, an actor who dou- 
bles as a professional nostal- 
gist — he edited the Chelsea House 
reprint of the Johnson Smith 
catalogue — knows his trade. In 
picture and story. The Pulps does 
exactly what its title implies; it 
recapitulates the sweep of the 
field from the earliest embryonic 
days of mass fiction at low prices 
unto its waning moments, tak- 



140 




ing in everything from the work- 
manlike to the ludicrously 
cliched, and from the straightfor- 
ward to the raunchy, across the en- 
tire board from ranch romances to 
Terence X. O'Leary, dyno-blast- 
er. 

You need no other history of the 
field. Even allowing for its nar- 
rower focus, Quentin Reynolds' 
The Fiction Factory has now 
been supplanted. And as for nos- 
talgic impact, there's no contest at 
all. 

Mind you, you may have to turn 
your head off to the formalin edi- 
torial expositions that precede 
the gutsy samples of fiction 
Goodstone has selected. But these 
interjections are knowledge- 
able at least up to the limit of my 
poor power to assess, and maybe 
my slightly negative feeling 
about this aspect of the book is on- 
ly a reflection of the very thing 
the book evokes so strongly — a 
recollection of how vital and 
ebullient pulp prose was, even the 
trashiest of it. 



M ore issues at ha nd. the 

second book of criticism by 
James Blish, is now out. You have 
to order it by mail, most likely. 
You should. The price is $5.00, and 
the address is Advent: Publish- 
ers, Inc., P.O. Box 9228, Chicago, 
Illinois 60690. 

The book is officially by Wil- 
liam Atheling, Jr., with an intro- 



duction by James Blish. As Athel- 
ing, Blish built a reputation in the 
fan magazines over the years as an 
sf critic second only (perhaps) to 
Damon Knight. He brings a better 
general education but a some- 
what less pellucid expression to 
the task than Knight does. 

This sequel to Advent's The Is- 
sue at Hand ($5.00) if you don't 
have that one, either, now's your 
chance to order both at one 
stroke is put together from di- 
verse sources, not all of them fan- 
zines as such. There's an essay on 
Heinlein from the short-lived pro- 
fessional fanzine edited by 
Damon Knight and Lester del Rey 
after the first Milford Confer- 
ence. Others were originally con- 
vention speeches. All of them first 
saw the light of reason within the 
general bounds of our parish, but 
the tone of this book is set by a bias 
toward longer, more thoughtful 
looks at science fiction than were 
evident in the first volume, which 
was nearly confined to short 
takes on contemporary num- 
bers of the professional maga- 
zines. 

There are long essays on Abe 
Merritt and Theodore Sturgeon. 
There are long reviews, now cast 
as essays, on particular pieces by 
Heinlein, Kuttner, Sturgeon, Al- 
gis Budrys (“incestuous” is the 
word you're groping for), and oth- 
ers such as Brian Aldiss and Har- 
lan Ellison, in somewhat shorter 
takes. There’s a very good sum-

mation of the critical literature 
previously extant, and the 
obligatory put-down of Sam Mos- 
kowitz. (Sam kind of forces it on 
you, is what I mean; Blish, in a 
singular instaace, actually 
makes some points in refutation 
which strike me as valid observa- 
tions unfraught by outrage. This 
is particularly remarkable in 
that in the customary case Blish is 
a ready outragee). 

Jim has a talent for enthusiasm, 
both positive and negative. In my 
book, he has an altogether exag- 
gerated respect for Alexei Pan- 
shin’s Heinlein in Dimension 
(Advent — $6.00), and to my mind 
Merritt’s Ship of Ishtar has vir- 
tues as a story which are lost on 
Blish as a classicist. Nor is there 
really a lot to be gained by notice- 
ably going out of one’s way to slap 
at Judy Merril, who withdrew as 
a target some time ago. Etc. But 
these punctuations of mine are 
the kind of thing you say to each 
other over beer; they are intended 
as tokens of respect for the book 
as a whole, and for the man whose 
thinking is reflected in it. 

The essay on me, by the way, is a 
very long review of Rogue Moon, a 
book that went to the publisher as 
The Death Machine. (To correct 
Jim slightly, that remains my ti- 
tle of preference, with Halt, Pas- 
senger] and The Armiger as al- 
ternates, in that order. Rogue 
Moon runs somewhat behind 
Sex-Gods of Luna, but as I grow 



older 1 tolerate Fawcett’s rea- 
sons better . not that 1 agree 
with them). 

Anyhow, my major impression 
of that essay now is that I’ve had 
no idea I had as much in me as Jim 
finds. This leads me to wonder not 
only whether even the Blish intel- 
lect can avoid embellishment but 
also whether this cruder appar- 
atus of mine makes only the al- 
ready distressing number of faux 
pas it permits itself to be aware 
of. 

S AY, it’s not too late to put in 
a bad word for The Andro- 
meda Strain (Dell #0199, $1.25), 
Michael Crichton’s supposedly sci- 
ence-fictional refiguring of the 
Guns of Navarrone formula. 
Full of speciously factual asides 
and inaccurate circumstantial 
portrayals of applied science and 
technology, this compendium of 
false leads, directionless plot 
turns and cheats on the reader, be- 
lies Crichton’s noteworthy skill 
with words. No wonder it was a 
30-week best-seller in hardback. 
But it’s a dog nevertheless. 

I WISH Ballantine had sent me 
A.J. Fangguth’s Christs to 
review. (Ballantine Book #01584, 
95c). My friend Ed Coudal, SF fan 
and former top editor for a Chi- 
cago paper, who now leases box- 
cars in the same shop where I sell 
trucks, passed it over to me as one 
of the most striking books, peri- 



142 



GALAXY 




od, in years, and certainly one of 
the wildest modern popular re- 
ligious books ever. 

It’s a series of short takes about 
the life of Christ; Langguth's de- 
vice is to suppose that Christ is in- 
exhaustible . but not always 
knowable. He appears in various 
guises in various what you may call 
alternate worlds. Not only that, but 
most of the supporting players 
for his role are well aware of his 
doom from the very beginning, 
and reminisce, and criticize this 
particular given performance, 
in not always reverent tones. At 
one particular instance, the play- 
er everyone thought was Peter 
turns out to be the real candidate. 
At another, the fellow Christ 
meets in the desert and suspects 
of being Satan turns out to be 
the Christ of the next oasis, with 



exactly the same suspicion. 

I'd like to make clear that this is 
by no means an irreverent book. 
Langguth's objective is to make 
the story point come alive again, 
and he does. He is a subtle, pro- 
found thinker as well as a delight- 
ful writer, and he has that inquir- 
ing mind we can all appreciate. I 
quote the opening selection in its 
entirety, hinting that the bal- 
ance of the book may be intended 
as a provisional reply: 

“I have come to die for your 
sins," Jesus told a stooped figure 
passing him on the road. 

"Then what am I to die for?" the 
old man asked. 

Jesus took a small notebook 
from his pocket and copied the 
question. “If I may have your 
name and address," he said, "an 
answer will be sent to you." ★

M ANNERAN, the province, 
was favored by the gods. The 
air was mild and sweet, filled all 
the year through with the fra- 
grance of flowers. Winter does not 
reach so far south and the Man- 
nerangi, when they would see snow, 
go as tourists to the Huishtor 
peaks and gape at the strange cold 
coating of whiteness that passes 
for water in other lands. The warm 
sea that borders Manneran on 
east and south yields food enough 



to feed half the continent and to 
the southwest there is the Gulf of 
Sumar as well, with further 
bounty. War has rarely touched 
Manneran, protected as it is by a 
shield of mountains and water 
from the peoples of the western 
lands and separated from its 
neighbor to the north, Salla, by 
the immense torrent of the River 
Woyn. Now and again we have at- 
tempted to invade Manneran by 
sea, but never with any conviction 
that we would be successful, nor 
has there been any success; when 
Salla engages seriously in war, 
the foe is always Glin. 

Manneran, the city, must also 
have enjoyed special divine bless- 
ings. Its site is the finest natural 
harbor in all Velada Borthan, a 
deep-cut bay framed by two op- 
posing fingers of land, jutting 
toward one another in such a way 
that no breakwaters are needed 
there and ships sit easily at anchor. 
This harbor is one mighty source 
of the province’s prosperity. It 
constitutes the chief link between 
the eastern and western prov- 
inces, for there is little landborne 
commerce across the continent by 
way of the Burnt Lowlands and, 
since our world lacks natural 
fuels, so far as we know, airborne 
traffic is never likely to amount 
to much here. So ships of the nine 
western provinces travel east- 
ward through the Strait of Sumar 
to the port of Manneran and ships 
from Manneran make regular 



145 




calls on the western coast. The 
Mannerangi then retail western 
goods to Salla, Glin and Krell in 
their own vessels, reaping the 
usual profits of go-betweens. The 
harbor of Manneran is the only 
place on our world where men of 
all thirteen flags may be seen at 
once; and this busy commerce 
spills an unending flow of wealth 
into the coffers of the Man- 
nerangi. In addition, their inland 
districts are rich in fertility, even 
up to the Huishtor slopes, which in 
their latitudes are unfrozen ex- 
cept at the summits. The farms of 
Manneran have two or three har- 
vests a year and, by way of Stroin 
Gap, the Mannerangi have access 
to the Wet Lowlands and all the 
strange and valuable fruits and 
spices produced there. Small won- 
der, then, that those who love lux- 
uries seek their fortunes in Man- 
neran. 

As if all this good fortune were 
not enough, the Mannerangi have 
persuaded the world that they live 
in the holiest spot on Borthan and 
multiply their revenues by main- 
taining sacred shrines as magnets 
for pilgrims. One might think that 
Threish, on the western coast, 
where our ancestors first settled 
and the Covenant was drawn up, 
would put itself forward as a 
place of pilgrimage second to 
none. Indeed, there is some sort of 
shrine in Threish and westerners 
too poor to travel to Manneran 
visit it. But Manneran has estab- 



lished itself as the holy of holies. 
The youngest of all our provinces, 
too, except only the breakaway 
kingdom of Krell; yet by a show of 
inner conviction and energetic 
advertisement has Manneran 
managed to make itself sacred. 
There is irony in this, for the Man- 
nerangi hold more loosely to the 
Covenant than any of us in the 
thirteen provinces; their tropical 
life has softened them somewhat 
and they open their souls to one 
another to a degree that would get 
them ostracized as selfbarers in 
Glin or Salla. Still, they have the 
Stone Chapel, where miracles are 
reliably reported to have occur- 
red, where the gods supposedly 
came forth in the flesh only seven 
hundred years ago, and it is every- 
one’s hope to have his child receive 
his adult name in the Stone Chapel 
on Naming Day. From all over the 
continent they come for that fes- 
tival, to the vast profit of the Man- 
nerangi hostelkeepers. Why, I 
was named in the Stone Chapel 
myself. 

W HEN we were docked in Man- 
neran and the longshoremen 
were at work unloading our cargo 1 
collected my pay and left ship to 
enter town. At the foot of the pier 
I paused to pick up a shore pass 
from the Mannerangi immigra- 
tion officials. “How long will you 
be in town?” I was asked. Blandly 
I replied that I meant to stay 
among them for three days, al-

though my real intent was to set- 
tle for the rest of my years in this 
place. 

Twice before had I been in Man- 
neran; once just out of my infancy, 
to be bonded to Halum, and once 
when 1 was seven, for my Naming 
Day. My memories of the city 
amounted to nothing more than 
vague and random patterns of 
colors: the pale pink, green and 
blue tones of the buildings, the 
dark green masses of the heavy 
vegetation, the black solemn in- 
terior of the Stone Chapel. As I 
walked away from the waterfront 
those colors bombarded me again 
and glowing images out of my 
childhood shimmered before my 
dazzled eyes. Manneran is not 
built of stone, as our northern 
cities are, but rather of a kind of 
artificial plaster, which they 
paint in light pastel hues, so that 
every wall and facade sings joy- 
fully and billows like a curtain in 
the sunlight. The day was a bright 
one and the beams of light bounced 
gaily about, setting the streets 
ablaze and forcing me to shade my 
eyes. I was stunned also by the 
complexity of the streets. Man- 
nerangi architects rely greatly on 
ornaments; the buildings are 
decked with ornate ironwork bal- 
conies, fanciful scrollings, flam- 
boyant rooftiles, gaudy window- 
draperies, so that the northern 
eye beholds at first glance a mon- 
strous baffling clutter, which re- 
solves itself only gradually into a 



vista of elegance and grace and 
proportion. Everywhere, too, are 
plants: trees line both sides of each 
street, vines cascade from win- 
dow-boxes, flowers burst into 
bloom in curbside gardens and 
the hint of lush vegetation is evi- 
dent in the sheltered courtyards of 
the houses. The effect is refined 
and sophisticated, an interplay of 
jungle profusion and disciplined 
urban textures. Manneran is an 
extraordinary city, subtle, sen- 
suous, languorous, overripe. 

My childhood recollections did 
not prepare me for the heat. A 
steamy haze hung over the streets. 
The air was wet and heavy. 1 felt I 
could almost touch the heat, could 
seize it and grasp it, could wring it 
like water from the atmosphere. It 
was raining heat and 1 was 
drenched in it. I was clad in a 
coarse, heavy gray uniform, the 
usual wintertime issue aboard a 
Glinish merchant ship, and this 
was a sweltering spring morning 
in Manneran; two dozen paces in 
that stifling humidity and I was 
ready to rip off my chafing clothes 
and go naked. 

A TELEPHONE directory gave 
me the address of Segvord Hel- 
alam, my bondsister’s father. I 
hired a taxi and went there. 
Helalam lived just outside the city, 
in a cool, leafy suburb of grand 
homes and glistening lakes; a 
high brick wall shielded his house 
from the view of passersby. 1 rang

at the gate and waited to be scan- 
ned. A voice within the house, 
some butler, no doubt, queried me 
over the scanner line and I re- 
plied, “Kinnall Darival of Salla, 
bondbrother to the daughter of 
the High Justice Helalam, wishes 
to call upon the father of his bond- 
sister." 

"The Lord Kinnall is dead," 1 
was informed coldly, "and so you 
are some impostor." 

I rang again. "Scan this and 
judge if he be dead," I said, hold- 
ing up to the machine’s eye my 
royal passport, which I had kept 
so long concealed. “This is 
Kinnall Darival before you and it 
will not go well with you if you 
deny him access to the High Jus- 
tice!" 

"Passports may be stolen. Pass- 
ports may be forged." 

"Open the gate!" 

There was no reply. A third time 
I rang and this time the unseen 
butler told me that the police 
would be summoned unless 1 de- 
parted at once. I had not reckoned 
on any of this. Would I have to go 
back to town, take lodgings, write 
Segvord Helalam for an ap- 
pointment and offer evidence 
that 1 still lived? 

By good fortune 1 was spared 
those bothers. A sumptuous black 
groundcar drew up. of a kind used 
generally only by the highest 
aristocracy, and from it stepped 
Segvord Helalam, High Justice 
of the Port of Manneran. He was 



then at the height of his career and 
he carried himself with kingly 
grace: a short man but well con- 
structed, with a fine head, a florid 
face, a noble mane of white hair, a 
look of strength and purpose. His 
eyes, an intense blue, were cap- 
able of flashing fire and his nose 
was an imperial beak, but he can- 
celed all his look of ferocity with a 
warm, ready smile. He was recog- 
nized in Manneran as a man of 
wisdom and temperance. I went 
immediately toward him, with a 
glad cry of "Bondfather!" Swing- 
ing about, he stared at me in be- 
wilderment and two large young 
men who had been with him in his 
groundcar placed themselves be- 
tween the High Justice and my- 
self as though they believed me to 
be an assassin. 

"Your bodyguard may relax," 1 
said. "Are you unable to recog- 
nize Kinnall of Salla?" 

"The Lord Kinnall died last 
year,” Segvord replied quickly. 

"That comes as grievous news to 
Kinnall himself," I said. I drew 
myself tall, resuming princely 
mien for the first time since my sad 
exit from the city of Glain, and ges- 
tured at the High Justice's protec- 
tors with such fury that they gave 
ground, slipping off to the side. 
Segvord studied me carefully. He 
had last seen me at my brother’s 
coronation; two years had gone by 
since then and the last softness of 
childhood had been stripped from 
me. My year of felling logs showed 



148 



GALAXY 




in the contours of my frame, my 
winter among the farmers had 
weathered my face and my weeks 
as a sailor had left me grimy and 
unkempt, with tangled hair and a 
shaggy beard. Segvord’s gaze cut 
gradually through these transfor- 
mations until he was convinced of 
my identity; then suddenly he rush- 
ed at me, embracing me with such 
fervor that 1 nearly lost my footing 
in surprise. He cried my name and 
I cried his; then the gate was open- 
ing and he was hurrying me with- 
in. The lofty cream-colored man- 
sion loomed before me, the goal of 
all my wanderings and turmoil. 

I WAS conducted to a pretty 
chamber and told that it was to 
be mine. Two servant girls came to 
me. Plucking off my sweaty sea- 
man’s garb, they led me, giggling 
all the while, to a huge tiled tub, 
bathed and perfumed me, cropped 
my hair and beard somewhat and 
let me pinch and tumble them a 
bit. They brought me clothes of 
fine fabric, of a sort I had not 
worn since my days as royalty, all 
sheer and white and flowing and 
cool. And they offered me jewel- 
ry, a triple ring set with I later 
learned — a sliver of the Stone 
Chapel’s floor, and also a gleam- 
ing pendant, a tree crystal from 
the land of Threish, on a leather 
thong. At length, after several 
hours of polishing, 1 was deemed 
fit to present to the High Justice. 
Segvord received me in the room 



he called his study, which actually 
was a great hall worthy of a sep- 
tarch’s palace, in which he sat en- 
throned even as a ruler would. 1 re- 
call feeling some annoyance at his 
pretensions, for not only was he 
not royal, but he was of the lower 
aristocracy of Manneran. He 
had been of no stature whatever 
until his appointment to high of- 
fice had put him on the road to 
fame and wealth. 

1 asked at once after my bond- 
sister Halum. 

“She fares well,’’ he said, 
“though her soul was darkened by 
the tidings of your supposed 
death.’’ 

“Where is she now?” 

“On holiday, in the Sumar Gulf, 
on an island where we have another 
home.” 

1 felt a chill. “Has she married?” 
“To the regret of all who love 
her, she has not.” 

“Is there anyone, though?” 
“No,” Segvord said. “She seems 
to prefer chastity. Of course, she is 
very young. When she returns, 
Kinnall, perhaps you could speak 
to her, pointing out that she might 
think now about making a match, 
for now she might have some fair 
lord, while in a few years’ time 
there will be new maidens ahead of 
her in line.” 

“How soon will she be back 
from this island?” 

“At any moment,” said the High 
Justice. “How amazed she will be, 
to find you here!”

149 




I ASKED him concerning my 
death. He replied that word had 
come two years earlier that I was 
mad and had wandered, helpless 
and deluded, into Glin. “Then,” 
he said, “there were reports that 
the Lord Stirron had sent agents 
into Glin after you, so that you 
could be brought back for treat- 
ment. And lastly, this summer 
past, one of your brother’s min- 
isters gave it out that you had gone 
roaming in the Glinish Huishtors 
in the pit of winter and had been 
lost in the snows — in a blizzard no 
man could have survived.” 

“But of course the Lord 
Kinnall’s body was not recovered 
in the warm months of the year 
gone by and was left to wither in 
the Huishtors, instead of being 
brought back to Salla for a proper 
burial.” 

“There was no news of finding 
the body, no.” 

“Then obviously,” 1 said, “the 
Lord Kinnall’s body awakened in 
the springtime, trekked about on 
a ghostly parade, went its way 
southward and now at last has pre- 
sented itself on the doorstep of 
the High Justice of the Port of 
Manneran.” 

Segvord laughed. “A healthy 
ghost!” 

“A weary one, as well.” 

“What befell you in Glin?” 

“A cold time in more ways than 
one.” I told him of my snubbing at 
the hands of my mother’s kin, of 
my stay in the mountains and all 



the rest. When he had heard that, 
he wished to know what my plans 
were in Manneran; to this 1 re- 
plied that 1 had no plans other than 
to find some honorable enter- 
prise, succeed in it, marry and 
settle down, for Salla was closed to 
me and Glin held no temptations. 
Segvord nodded gravely. There 
was, he said, a clerkship open at 
this very moment in his office. The 
job carried little pay and less pres- 
tige and it was absurd to ask a 
prince of Salla’s royal line to 
accept it, but still it was clean 
work, with a fine chance of 
advancement, and it might serve 
to give me a foothold while I ac- 
climated myself to the Manner- 
angi way of life. 1 told him at once 
that 1 would gladly enter his em- 
ploy, with no heed to my royal 
blood, since all that was behind 
me now, done with and imaginary 
besides. “What one makes of him- 
self here,” 1 said soberly, “will de- 
pend wholly on his merits, not on 
the circumstances of rank and in- 
fluence.” Which was, of course, 
pure piffle: instead of trading on 
my high birth, I would instead 
here make capital out of being 
bondbrother to the High Justice of 
the Port’s daughter, a connec- 
tion that had come to me because 
of my high birth alone — and where 
was the effect of merit in any of 
that? 

T he searchers are getting closer 
to me all the time. Yesterday,

while on a long walk through this 
zone of the Burnt Lowlands, I 
found well south of here the fresh 
track of a groundcar impressed 
deep in the dry and fragile crust of 
the red sand. And this morning, 
idly strolling in the place where 
the hornfowl gather drawn there 
by some suicidal impulse, may- 
be — I heard a droning in the sky 
and looked up to see a plane of the 
Sallan military passing over- 
head. One does not often see sky- 
vehicles here. It swooped and cir- 
cled, hornfowl-fashion, but 1 hud- 
dled under a twisted erosion-knoll 
and I think I went unnoticed. 

1 might be mistaken about these 
intrusions: the groundcar just 
some hunting party casually pass- 
ing through the region, the plane 
merely out on a training flight. 
But 1 think not. If there are hunt- 
ers here, I am the prey they hunt. 
The net will close about me. I must 
try to write more quickly and be 
more concise; too much of what I 
need to say is yet untold and I fear 
being interrupted before 1 am 
done. Stirron, let me be for just a 
few more weeks! 

VIll 

T he High Justice of the Port is 
one of Manneran’s supreme of- 
ficials. He holds jurisdiction over 
all commercial affairs in the 
capital. If there are disputes be- 
tween merchants they are tried in 
his court and by treaty he has 



authority over the nationals of 
every province, so that a seacap- 
tain of Glin or Krell, a Sallan or a 
westerner, when hailed before the 
High Justice, is subject to his ver- 
dicts with no rights of appeal to 
the courts of his homeland. This is 
the High Justice's ancient func- 
tion, but if he were nothing but an 
arbiter of mercantile squabbles 
he would hardly have the gran- 
deur that he possesses. However, 
over the centuries other respon- 
sibilities have fallen to him. He 
alone regulates the flow of foreign 
shipping into the harbor of Man- 
neran, granting trade permits for 
so many Glinish vessels a year, so 
many from Threish, so many from 
Salla. The prosperity of a dozen 
provinces is subject to his deci- 
sions. Therefore he is courted by 
septarchs, flooded with gifts, 
buried in kindnesses and praise, in 
the hope that he will allow this land 
or that an extra ship in the year to 
come. The High Justice, then, is 
the economic filter of Velada Bor- 
than, opening and closing com- 
mercial outlets as he pleases; he 
does this not by whim but by con- 
sideration of the ebb and flow of 
wealth across the continent. 

The office is not hereditary, but 
the appointment is for life. A 
High Justice can be removed only 
through intricate and well-nigh 
impracticable impeachment 
procedures. Thus it comes to pass 
that a vigorous High Justice, such 
as Segvord Helalam, can become 



ATIME OF CHANGES 



151 




more powerful in Manneran than 
the prime septarch himself. The 
septarchy of Manneran is in de- 
cay in any case; two of the seven 
seats have gone unfilled for the 
past hundred years' or more and 
the occupants of the remaining 
five have ceded so much of their 
authority to civil servants that 
they are little more than cere- 
monial figures. The prime sep- 
tarch still has some shreds of maj- 
esty, but he must consult with the 
High Justice of the Port on all 
matters of economic concern.' 
And the High justice has en- 
tangled himself so inextricably 
in the machinery of Manneran's 
government that it is difficult to 
say truly who is the ruler and who 
the civil servant. 

On my third day in Manneran, 
Segvord took me to his court- 
house to contract me into my Job. 
I, who was raised in a palace, was 
awed to see the headquarters of 
the Port Justiciary; what amazed 
me was not its opulence (for it had 
none) but its great size. I beheld a 
broad yellow-colored brick struc- 
ture, four stories high, squat and 
massive, that seemed to run the 
entire length of the waterfront, 
two blocks inland from the piers. 
Within it at worn desks in high- 
ceilinged offices were armies of 
drudging clerks, shuffling papers 
and stamping receipts. Segvord 
led me on an endless march 
through the building, receiving 
the homage of the workers as he 



passed their dank and sweaty of- 
fices; he paused here and there to 
greet someone, to glance casually 
at some half-written report, to 
study a board on which, appar- 
ently, the movements of every 
vessel within three days' journey 
of Manneran were being charted. 
At length we entered a noble suite 
of rooms, far from the bustle and 
hurry 1 had just seen. Here the 
High Justice himself presided. 
Showing me a cool and splendidly 
furnished room adjoining his 
own chamber, Segvord told me 
that this was where I would work. 

The contract I signed was like a 
drainer’s: I pledged myself to re- 
veal nothing of what 1 might learn 
in the course of my duties, on pain 
of terrible penalties. For its part 
the Port Justiciary promised me 
lifetime employment, steady in- 
creases of salary and various other 
privileges of a kind princes do not 
normally worry about. 

Quickly 1 discovered that 1 was 
to be no humble inkstained clerk. 
As Segvord had warned me, my 
pay was low and my rank in the 
bureaucracy almost nonexist- 
ent, but my responsibilities 
proved to be great ones; in effect, I 
was his private secretary. All con- 
fidential reports intended for the 
High Justice’s eyes would cross 
my desk first. My task was to dis- 
card those that were of no impor- 
tance and to prepare abridge- 
ments of the others, all but those 1 
deemed to be of the highest perti- 



152

nence, which went to him com- 
plete. If the High Justice is the 
economic filter of Velada Bor- 
than, 1 was to be the filter’s filter, 
for he would read only what I 
wished him to read and make his 
decisions on the basis of what I 
gave him. Once this was clear to 
me I knew that Segvord had 
placed me on the path to great 
power in Manneran. 

I MPATIENTLY I awaited Hal- 
um’s return from her isle in the 
Gulf of Sumar. Neither bondsis- 
ter nor bondbrother had I had for 
over two years and drainers could 
not take their place; I ached to sit 
up late at night with Halum or 
Noim, as in the old days, opening 
self to self. Noim was somewhere 
in Salla, I supposed, but I knew 
not where and Halum, though she 
was said to be due back imminent- 
ly from holidaying, did not ap- 
pear in my first week in Man- 
neran, nor the second. During the 
third, I left the Justiciary office 
early one day, feeling ill from the 
humidity and the tensions of 
mastering my new role and was 
driven to Segvord's estate. En- 
tering the central courtyard, 1 
caught sight of a tall, slender girl at 
the far end, plucking from a vine a 
golden flower for her dark glossy 
hair. I could not see her face, but 
from her figure and bearing I had 
no doubt of her, and joyfully 1 
cried, “Halum!” and rushed 
across the courtyard. She turned 



frowning to me, halting me in 
mid-rush. Her brow was furrowed 
and her lips were tight together; 
her gaze was chilly and remote. 
What did that cold glance mean? 
Her face was Halum’s face — dark 
eyes, fine slim proud nose, firm 
chin, bold cheekbones — and yet 
her face was strange to me. Could 
two years have changed my bond- 
sister so greatly? The main dif- 
ferences between the Halum I re- 
membered and the woman I saw 
were subtle ones, differences of 
expression, a tilt of the eye- 
brows, a flicker of the nostrils, a 
quirking of the mouth, as though 
the whole soul itself within her 
had altered. Also there were some 
minor differences of feature, I 
saw as I drew nearer, but these 
could be ascribed to the passing of 
time or to the faults of my mem- 
ory. My heart sped and my fingers 
trembled and an odd heat of con- 
fusion spread across my shoul- 
ders and back. 1 would have gone 
to her and embraced her, but sud- 
denly I feared her in her transfor- 
mations. 

“Halum?” 1 said uncertainly, 
hoarse-voiced, dry-throated. 

“She is not yet here.” A voice 
like falling snow, deeper than Hal- 
um’s, more resonant, colder. 

1 was stunned. Like enough to 
Halum to be her twin! I knew of 
only one sister to Halum, then still 
a child, not yet sprouting her 
breasts. It was not possible for her 
to have concealed from me all her

life a twin or a sister somewhat 
older. But the resemblance was 
extraordinary and disturbing. 1 
have read that on old Earth they 
had ways of making artificial be- 
ings out of chemicals, that could 
deceive even a mother or a lover 
with the likeness to some real per- 
son — and I could well have been 
persuaded that moment that the 
process had come down to us, 
across the centuries, across the 
gulf of night, and that this false 
Halum before me was a devilishly 
clever synthetic image of my true 
bondsister. 

1 said, “Forgive this foolish er- 
ror. One mistook you for Halum." 

“It happens often." 

“Are you some kin of hers?” 

“Daughter to the brother of the 
High Justice Segvord.” 

She gave her name as Loimel 
Helalam. Never had Halum 
spoken to me of this cousin — or if 
she had I had no recollection of it. 
How odd that she had hidden from 
me the existence of this mirror- 
Halum in Manneran! I told her 
my name and Loimel recognized it 
as that of Halum’s bondbrother, 
of whom she had evidently heard 
a good deal. She softened her 
stance a little and some of the chill 
that was about her now thawed. 
For my part I was over the shock 
of finding the supposed Halum 
to be another and I was begin- 
ning to warm to Loimel, for she 
was beautiful and desirable and — 
unlike Halum herself — available. 1 



could by looking at her out of one 
eye pretend to myself that she was 
indeed Halum I even managed to 
deceive myself into accepting her 
voice as my bondsister’s. Together 
we strolled the courtyard, talking. I 
learned that Halum would come 
home this evening and that Loimel 
was here to arrange a hearty re- 
ception for her; I learned also 
some things about Loimel, for, in 
the injudicious fashion of many 
Mannerangi, she guarded her pri- 
vacy less sternly than a north- 
erner would. She told me her age: a 
year older than Halum (and I also). 
She told me she was unmarried, 
having recently terminated an 
unpromising engagement to a 
prince of an old but unfortunate- 
ly impoverished family of Man- 
nerangi nobility. She explained 
her resemblance to Halum by 
saying that her mother and Hal- 
um's were cousins, as well as her 
father's being brother to Hal- 
um’s. And five minutes later, 
when we walked arm in arm, she 
hinted scandalously that in fact 
the High Justice had invaded his 
elder brother’s bridal couch long 
ago, so that she was properly half- 
sister to Halum, not cousin. And 
she told me much more. 

I COULD think only of Halum, 
Halum, Halum, Halum. This 
Loimel existed for me solely as a 
reflection of my bondsister. An 
hour after we first met, Loimel and 
I were together in my bedroom

and when her gown had dropped 
from her I told myself that Hal- 
um’s skin must be creamy as this, 
that Halum’s breasts must be 
much like these, that Halum’s 
thighs could be no less smooth, that 
Halum’s nipples would also turn 
to turrets when a man’s thumbs 
brushed their tips. Then I lay 
naked beside Loimel and made 
her ready for taking with many 
cunning caresses; soon she gasped 
and cried out. But an instant be- 
fore I would have taken her the 
thought came coldly to me, fV/ty, 
this is forbidden — to have one's 
bondsister . and my passion 
left me. 

It was only a momentary embar- 
rassment: looking down at her 
face, I told myself brusquely that 
this was Loimel and not Halum. 
My manhood revived and our 
bodies joined. Yet how intricately 
our loins are linked to our minds 
and how tricky a thing it is when 
we embrace a woman while pre- 
tending she is another! 

That evening my bondsister Hal- 
um at last returned from her holi- 
day in the Gulf of Sumar and wept 
with happy surprise to see me alive 
and in Manneran. When she 
stood beside Loimel I was all the 
more amazed by their near twin- 
ship: Halum’s waist was more 
slender, Loimel’s bosom deeper, 
but one finds these variations 
even in true sisters and in most 
ways of the body Halum and her 
cousin seemed to have been 



stamped from the same mold. Yet 
I was struck by a profound and 
subtle difference also, most visi- 
ble in the eyes, through which, as 
the poem says, shines the inner 
light of the soul. The radiance that 
came from Halum was tender, 
gentle and mild, like the first soft 
beams of sunlight drifting 
through a summer morning’s 
mist; Loimel’s eyes gave a colder, 
harsher glow, that of a sullen 
winter afternoon. As I looked 
from one girl to the other I formed 
a quick intuitive judgment: 
Halum is pure love, and Loimel is 
pure self. But I recoiled from that 
verdict the instant it was born. I 
did not know Loimel; I had not 
found her thus far to be anything 
but open and giving; I had no right 
to disparage her in that way. 

The two years had not aged 
Halum so much as burnished her 
and she had come to the full radi- 
ance of her beauty. She was deeply 
tanned and in her short white 
sheath she seemed like a bronzed 
statue of herself; the planes of her 
face were more angular than they 
had been, giving her a delicate 
look of almost boyish charm; she 
moved with floating grace. The 
house was full of strangers for this 
her homecoming party. After our 
first embrace she was swept away 
from me and I was left with 
Loimel. But toward the end of the 
evening 1 claimed my bondright 
and took Halum away to my 
chamber, saying, “There is two

years' talking to do." Thoughts 
tumbled chaotically in my mind; 
how could 1 tell her all that had 
happened to me — How could 1 
learn from her what she had done, 
all in the first rujh of words? 1 
could not arrange my thinking. 
We sat down facing one another 
at a prim distance, Halum on the 
couch where only a few hours be- 
fore 1 had coupled with her cousin, 
pretending then to myself that 
she was Halum. A tense smile 
passed between us. “Where can 
one begin?" I said and Halum, at 
the same instant, said the same 
words. That made us laugh and dis- 
solved the tension. And then 1 
heard my own voice asking, with- 
out preamble, whether Halum 
thought that Loimel would accept 
me as her husband. 

L oimel and l were married by 
Segvord Helalam in the Stone 
Chapel at the crest of the sum- 
mer, after months of preparatory 
rituals and purifications. We 
made these observances by re- 
quest of Loimel’s father, a man of 
great devoutness. For his sake we 
undertook a rigorous series of 
drainings — day after day I kneeled 
and yielded up the full contents of 
my soul to a certain Jidd, the best 
known and most costly drainer in 
Manneran. When this was done 
Loimel and I went on pilgrimage 
to the nine shrines of Manneran 
and I squandered my slender 
salary on candles and incense. We 



even performed the archaic cere- 
mony known as the Showing, in 
which she and 1 stepped out on a 
secluded beach one dawn, chaper- 
oned by Halum and Segvord and, 
screened from their eyes by an 
elaborate canopy, formally dis- 
closed our nakedness to one an- 
other, so that neither of us could 
say afterward that we had gone 
into marriage concealing de- 
fects from the other. 

The rite .of union was a grand 
event, with musicians and sing- 
ers. My bondbrother Noim, sum- 
moned from Salla, stood up as 
pledgeman for me and ring-linker 
to be. Manneran’s prime sep- 
tarch, a waxen old man, attended 
the wedding, as did most of the 
local nobility. The gifts we re- 
ceived were of immense value. 
Among them was a golden bowl in- 
laid with strange gems, manufac- 
tured on some other world and sent 
to us by my brother Stirron, along 
with a cordial message express- 
ing regret that affairs of state re- 
quired him to remain in Salla. 
Since 1 had snubbed his wedding it 
was no surprise that he snubbed 
mine. What did surprise me was 
the friendly tone of his letter. 
Making no reference to the cir- 
cumstances of my disappear- 
ance from Salla, but offering 
thanks that the rumor of my death 
had proven false, Stirron gave me 
his blessing and asked me to come 
with my bride for a ceremonial 
visit to his capital as soon as we 



156

were able. Apparently he had 
learned that I meant to settle 
permanently in Manneran — and 
so would be no rival for his throne; 
therefore he could think of me 
warmly again. 

1 often wondered, and after all 
these years still do wonder, why 
Loimel accepted me. She had just 
turned down a prince of her own 
realm because he was poor: here 
was I, also a prince, but an exiled 
one, and even poorer. Why take 
me? For my charm in wooing? 1 
had little of that; 1 was still young 
and thick-tongued. For my pros- 
pects of wealth and power? At that 
time those prospects seemed 
feeble indeed. For my physical 
appeal? Certainly 1 had some of 
that, but Loimel was too shrewd to 
marry just for broad shoulders 
and powerful muscles. I conclud- 
ed, finally, that there were two 
reasons why Loimel took me. 
First, she was lonely and troubled 
after the breakup of her other 
trothing. Second, Loimel envied 
Halum in all things and knew that 
by marrying me she would gain 
possession of the one thing Flal- 
um could never have. 

My own motive for seeking 
Loimel’s hand needs no deep prob- 
ing to uncover. It was Flalum I 
loved; Loimel was Flalum's im- 
age; Halum was denied me, there- 
fore I took Loimel. Beholding 
Loimel, I was free to think I be- 
held Halum. Embracing Loimel, 
I might tell myself 1 embraced 



Halum. When 1 offered myself 
to Loimel as husband, I felt no 
particular love for her and had 
reason to think 1 might not even 
like her; yet I was driven to her as 
the nearest proxy to my true de- 
sire. 

Marriages contracted for such 
reasons as Loimel’s and mine do 
not often fare well. Ours thrived 
poorly; we began as strangers and 
grew even more distant the longer 
we shared a bed. In truth I had 
married a secret fantasy, not a 
woman. But we must conduct our 
marriages in the world of reality. 
And in that world my wife was 
Loimel. 

M eanwhile, in my office at 
the Port Justiciary, I struggled 
to do the job my bondfather had 
given me. Each day a formidable 
stack of reports and memoranda 
reached my desk; each day 1 tried 
to decide which must go before 
the High Justice and which were 
to be ignored. At first, naturally, 
1 had no grounds for judgment. 
Segvord helped me, though, as did 
several of the senior officials of 
the Justiciary, who rightly saw 
that they had more to gain by serv- 
ing me than by trying to block my 
inevitable rise. I took readily to 
the nature of my work and before 
the full heat of summer was upon 
Manneran 1 was operating confi- 
dently, as if I had spent the last 
twenty years at my tasks. 

Most of the material submitted 



ATIMEOFCHANGES

for the guidance of the High Jus- 
tice was nonsense. I learned swift- 
ly to detect that sort by a quick 
scanning, often by looking at just 
a single page. The style in which re- 
ports and/or proposals were writ- 
ten told me much; 1 found that a 
man who cannot phrase his 
thoughts cleanly on paper prob- 
ably has no thoughts worth notice. 
The style is the man. If the prose is 
heavy-footed and sluggish so, too, 
in all likelihood, is the mind of its 
author. A coarse and common 
mind offers coarse and common 
perceptions. I had to do a great 
deal of writing myself, summar- 
izing and condensing the reports 
of middling value, and whatever 
I have learned of the literary art 
may be traced to my years in the 
service of the High Justice. My 
style, too, reflects the man, for 1 
know myself to be earnest, 
solemn, fond of courtly gestures 
and given to communicating 
more perhaps than others really 
want to know; all these traits I find 
in my own prose. It has its faults, 
yet am I pleased with it: I have my 
faults, yet am I pleased with me. 

Before long I realized that the 
most powerful man in Manneran 
was a puppet whose strings 1 con- 
trolled. I decided which cases the 
High Justice should handle, I 
chose the applications for special 
favor that he would read, I gave 
him the capsuled commentaries 
on which his verdicts were based. 
Segvord had not accidentally al- 



lowed me to attain such power. It 
was necessary for someone to 
perform the screening duties I 
now handled and, until my com- 
ing to Manneran, the Job had been 
done by a committee of three, all 
ambitious to hold Segvord’s title 
some day. Fearing those men, 
Segvord had arranged to pro- 
mote them to positions of greater 
splendor but lesser responsibil- 
ity. Then he slid me into their 
place. His only son had died in boy- 
hood; all his patronage therefore 
fell upon me. Out of love of Hal- 
um he had coolly chosen to make 
a homeless Sallan prince one of 
the dominant figures of Manneran. 

I T WAS widely understood — by 
others long before me — how 
important I was going to be. 
Those princes at my wedding had 
not been there out of respect for 
Loimel’s family, but to curry favor 
with me. The soft words from Stir- 
ron were meant to insure I would 
show no hostility to Salla in my 
decision-making. Doubtless my 
royal cousin Truis of Glin now was 
wondering uneasily if I knew 
that it was his doing that the doors 
of his province had closed in my 
face; he too sent a fine gift for my 
marriage day. Nor did the flow of 
gifts cease with the nuptial cere- 
mony. Constantly there came to 
me handsome things from those 
whose interests were bound up in 
the doings of the Port Justiciary. 
In Salla we would call such gifts 



158 



GALAXY 




by their rightful name, which is 
bribes; but Segvord assured me 
that in Manneran there was no 
harm in accepting them as long as 
I did not let them interfere with 
my objectivity of judgment. Now 
I realized how, on the modest 
salary of a judge, Segvord had 
come to live in such princely style. 

So I found my place in 
Manneran. 1 mastered the secrets 
of the Port Justiciary, developed 
a feel for the rhythms of maritime 
commerce and served the High 
Justice ably. I moved among 
princes and judges and men of 
wealth. 1 purchased a small but 
sumptuous house close by Seg- 
vord's and soon had the builders 
out to increase its size. 1 wor- 
shiped, as only the mighty do, at 
the Stone Chapel itself and went 
to the celebrated Jidd for my 
drainings. 1 was taken into a select 
athletic society and displayed my 
skills with the feathered shaft in 
Manneran Stadium. When 1 
visited Salla with my bride the 
springtime after our wedding, 
Stirron received me as if 1 were a 
Mannerangi septarch, parading 
me through the capital before a 
cheering multitude and feasting 
me royally at the palace. My first 
son, who was born that autumn, I 
named for him. 

Two other sons followed, Noim 
and Kinnall, and daughters 
named Halum and Loimel. The 
boys were straightbodied and 
strong; the girls promised to show 



the beauty of their namesakes. 1 
took great pleasure in heading a 
family. 1 longed for the time when I 
could have my sons with me hunt- 
ing in the Burnt Lowlands or 
shooting the rapids of the River 
Woyn; meanwhile 1 went hunting 
without them and the spears of 
many hornfowl came to decorate 
my home. 

Loimel, as I have said, remained 
a stranger to me. One does not ex- 
pect to penetrate the soul of one’s 
wife as deeply as that of one’s 
bondsister, but nevertheless, de- 
spite the customs of self-contain- 
ment we observe, one expects to 
develop a certain communion 
with someone one lives with. 1 
never penetrated anything of 
Loimel’s except her body. The 
warmth and openness she had 
showed me at our first meeting 
vanished swiftly and she became 
as aloof as any coldbelly wife of 
Glin. Once in the heat of lovemak- 
ing 1 used “1” to her, as I some- 
times did with whores. She slapped 
me and twisted her hips to cast me 
from her loins. We drifted apart. 
She had her life, 1 mine; after a 
time we made no attempt to reach 
across the gulf to one another. She 
spent her time at music, bathing, 
sunsleeping and piety; 1 at hunt- 
ing, gaming, rearing my sons and 
doing my work. She took lovers 
and 1 took mistresses. It was a 
frosty marriage. We scarcely ever 
quarreled; we were not close 
enough even for that. 



ATIAAE OF CHANGES 



159 




Noim and Halum were with me 
much of the time. They were great 
comforts to me. 

At the Justiciary my authority 
and responsibility grew year by 
year. I was not promoted from my 
position as clerk fo High Justice, 
nor did my salary increase by any 
large extent; yet all of Manneran 
knew that 1 was the one who gov- 
erned Segvord’s decisions and 1 
enjoyed a lordly income of 
“gifts.” Gradually Segvord with- 
drew from most of his duties, leav- 
ing them to me. He spent weeks at 
a time on his island retreat in the 
Gulf of Sumar, while I initialed 
and stamped documents in his 
name. In my twenty-fourth year, 
which was his fiftieth, he gave up 
his office altogether. Since I was 
not a Mannerangi by birth, it was 
impossible for me to become 
High Justice in his place; but Seg- 
vord arranged for the appoint- 
ment of an amiable nonentity as 
his successor, one Noldo Kali- 
mol, with the understanding that 
Kalimol would retain me in my 
place of power. 

You would be right to assume 
that my life in Manneran was one 
of ease and security, of wealth 
and authority. Week flowed 
serenely into week and, though 
perfect happiness is given to no 
man, I had few reasons for dis- 
content. The failings of my mar- 
riage I accepted placidly, since 
deep love between man and wife is 
not often encountered in our kind 



of society; as for my other sor- 
row, my hopeless love for Halum, 
I kept it buried deep within 
me — and when it rose painfully 
close to the surface of my soul I 
soothed myself by a visit to the 
drainer Jidd. 1 might have gone on 
uneventfully in that fashion to 
the end of my days, but for the ar- 
rival in my life of Schweiz the 
Earthman. 

IX 

E ARTHMEN come rarely to 
Borthan. Before Schweiz I had 
seen only two, both in the days 
when my father held the sep- 
tarchy. The first was a tall red- 
bearded man who visited Salla 
when I was about five years old; he 
was a traveler who wandered 
from world to world for his own 
amusement and had Just crossed 
the Burnt Lowlands alone and on 
foot. I remember studying his 
face with intense concentration, 
searching for the marks of his 
otherworldly origin — an extra 
eye, perhaps, horns, tendrils, 
fangs. 

He had none of these, of course, 
and so I openly doubted his story 
of having come from Earth. Stir- 
ron, with the benefit of two years’ 
more schooling than I, was the one 
who told me, in a jeering tone, that 
all the worlds of the heavens had 
been settled by people from Earth, 
including our own, which was 
why an Earthman looked just like 



160 



GALAXY 




any of us. Nevertheless, when a 
second Earthman showed up at 
court a few years later, I still 
searched for fangs and tendrils. 
This one was a husky, cheerful 
man with light brown skin, a sci- 
entist making a collection of our 
native wildlife for some uni- 
versity in a far part of the galaxy. 
My father took him into the Burnt 
Lowlands to get hornfowl; I 
begged to go along and was 
whipped for my nagging. 

I dreamed of Earth. I looked it 
up in books and saw a picture of a 
blue planet with many continents 
and a huge pockmarked moon go- 
ing around it and I thought. This is 
where we all came from. This is the 
beginning of everything. I read 
of the kingdoms and nations of 
old Earth, the wars and devasta- 
tion, the monuments, the trage- 
dies. The going forth into space, 
the attainment of the stars. There 
was a time when I even imagined I 
was an Earthman myself, born on 
that ancient planet of wonders and 
brought to Borthan in babyhood 
to be exchanged for a septarch’s 
true son. I told myself that when I 
grew up 1 would travel to Earth 
and walk through cities ten thou- 
sand years old, retracing the line 
of migration that had led my 
forefathers’ forefathers from 
Earth to Borthan. I wanted to 
own a piece of Earth, too, some 
potsherd, some bit of stone, some 
battered coin, as a tangible link to 
the world at the heart of man's 



wanderings. And 1 longed for 
some other Earthman to come to 
Borthan, so that I could ask him 
ten thousand thousand ques- 
tions, so that I could beg a slice of 
Earth for myself — but none came 
and 1 grew up and my obsession 
with the first of man’s planets fad- 
ed. 

Then Schweiz crossed my way. 

Schweiz was a man of com- 
merce. Many Earthmen are. At 
the time I met him he had been on 
Borthan a couple of years as 
representative of an exporting 
firm based in a solar system not 
far from our own; he dealt in 
manufactured goods and sought 
our furs and spices in return Dur- 
ing his stay in Manneran he had 
become entangled in contro- 
versy with a local importer over a 
cargo of stormshield furs from the 
northwestern coast. The man 
tried to give Schweiz poor quality 
at a higher-than-contracted 
price; Schweiz sued and the case 
went to the Port Justiciary. This 
was about three years ago and a 
little more than three years after 
the retirement of Segvord 
Helalam. 

The facts of the case were clear- 
cut and there was no doubt about 
the judgment. One of the lower 
justices approved Schweiz’ plea 
and ordered the importer to make 
good on his contract with the 
swindled Earthman. Ordinarily 1 
would not have become involved 
in the matter. But, when the 



A TIME OF CHANGES 



161 




papers on the case came to High 
Justice Kalimol for routine re- 
view just prior to affirmation of 
verdict, I glanced at them and saw 
that the plaintiff was an Earthman. 

Temptation speared me. My old 
fascination with that race — my de- 
lusion of fangs and tendrils and 
extra eyes — took hold of me again. 
I had to talk with him. What did I 
hope to get from him? The an- 
swers to the questions that had 
gone unanswered when I was a 
boy? Some clue to the nature of 
the forces that had driven man- 
kind to the stars? Or merely 
amusement, a moment of diver- 
sion in an overly placid life? 

1 asked Schweiz to report to my 
office. 



H e came in almost on the run, 
a frantic, energetic figure in 
clothes of flamboyant style and 
tone. Grinning with a manic glee, 
he slapped my palm in greeting, 
dug his knuckles into my desktop, 
pushed himself back a few steps 
and began to pace the room. 

“The gods preserve you, your 
grace!” he cried. 

1 thought his odd demeanor, his 
coiled-spring bounciness and his 
wild-eyed intensity stemmed from 
fear of me, for he had good reason 
to worry, called in by a powerful 
official to discuss a case that he 
thought he had won. But 1 found 
later that Schweiz' mannerisms 
were expressions of his own seeth- 



ing nature, not of any momen- 
tary and specific tension. 

He was a man of middle height, 
very sparely built, not a scrap of 
fat on his frame. His skin was 
tawny and his hair was the color of 
dark honey; it hung down in a 
straight flow to his shoulders. His 
eyes were bright and mischievous, 
his smile quick and sly and he radi- 
ated a boyish vigor, a dynamic 
enthusiasm, that charmed me just 
then, though it would eventually 
make him an exhausting com- 
panion for me. Yet he was no boy: 
his face bore the first tines of age 
and his hair, abundant though it 
was, was starting to go at the 
crown. 

“Be seated,” 1 said, for his 
capering was disturbing me. 1 
wondered how to launch the con- 
versation. How much could 1 ask 
him before he claimed Covenant 
at me and sealed his lips? Would he 
talk about himself and his world? 
Had I any right to pry into a 
foreigner’s soul in a way that 1 
would not dare do with a man of 
Borthan? I would see. Curiosity 
drove me. 1 picked up the sheaf of 
documents on his case — for he was 
looking at the file unhap- 
pily — and held them toward him, 
saying, “One places the first mat- 
ters first. Your verdict has been 
affirmed. Today High Justice 
Kalimol gives his seal and within 
a moonrise you’ll have your 
money.” 

“Happy words, your grace.”

“That concludes the legal 
business." 

“So short a meeting? It seems 
hardly necessary to have paid this 
call to exchange only a moment’s 
talk, your grace.” 

“One must admit, ’’ I said, “that 
you were summoned here to dis- 
cuss things other than your law- 
suit.” 

“Eh, your grace?” He looked 
baffled and alarmed. 

“To talk of Earth,” I said. “To 
gratify the idle inquisitiveness of 
a bored bureaucrat. Is that all 
right? Are you willing to talk a 
while, now that you’ve been lured 
here on the pretense of business? 
You know, Schweiz, one has al- 
ways been fascinated by Earth 
and by Earthmen.” To win some 
rapport with him, for he still was 
frowning and mistrustful, 1 told 
him the story of the two other 
Earthmen 1 had known and of my 
childhood belief that they should 
be alien in form. He relaxed and 
listened with pleasure and before 
1 was through he was laughing 
heartily. 

“Fangs!” he cried. “Tendrils!” 
He ran his hands over his face. 
“Did you really think that, your 
grace? That Earthmen were such 
bizarre creatures? By all the gods, 
your grace, 1 wish 1 had some 
strangeness about my body that 
could give you amusement!” 

1 flinched each time Schweiz 
spoke of himself in the first per- 
son. His casual obscenities punc- 



tured the mood I had attempted 
to build. Though I tried to pretend 
nothing was amiss, Schweiz real- 
ized his blunder and, leaping to his 
feet in obvious distress, said, “A 
thousand pardons! One tends to 
forget one’s grammar some- 
times, when one is not accus- 
tomed to — ” 

“No offense is taken,” I said 
hastily. 

“You must understand, your 
grace, that old habits of speech die 
hard — and in using your language 
one sometimes slips into the mode 
most natural for himself, even 
though — ” 

“Of course, Schweiz. A for- 
givable lapse.” He was trembling. 
“Besides,” 1 said, winking, “I’m a 
grown man. Do you think I’m so 
easily shocked?” My use of the vul- 
garities was deliberate, to put 
him at his ease. The tactic worked; 
he subsided, calming. 

I ASKED him to tell me about 
Earth, the mother of us all. 

“A small planet,” he said. “Far 
away. Choked in its own ancient 
wastes; the poisons of two thou- 
sand years of carelessness and 
overbreeding stain its skies and its 
seas and its land. An ugly place.” 
“In truth, ugly?” 

“There are still some attractive 
districts. Not many of them, and 
nothing to boast about. Some 
trees, here and there. A little 
grass. A lake. A waterfall. A val- 
ley. Mostly the planet is a dung-

hole. Earthmen often wish they 
could uncover their early ances- 
tors, bring them to life again and 
then throttle them. For their self- 
ishness. For their lack of concern 
for the generations to come. 
They filled the world with them- 
selves and used up everything.” 

“Is this why Earthmen built em- 
pires in the skies, then, to escape 
the filth of their home world?” 
“Part of it is that, yes,” Schweiz 
said. “There were so many billions 
of people. And those who had the 
strength to leave all went out and 
up. But it was more than running 
away, you know. It was a hunger 
to see strange things, a hunger to 
undertake journeys, a hunger to 
make fresh starts. To create new 
and better worlds of man. A string 
of Earths across the sky.” 

“And those who did not go?" I 
asked. “Earth still has those other 
billions of people?” I was thinking 
of Velada Borthan and its sparse 
forty or fifty millions. 

“Oh, no, no. It’s almost empty 
now, a ghost-world, ruined cities, 
cracking highways. Few live there 
any longer. Fewer are born there 
every year.” 

“But you were born there?” 

“On the continent called Europe, 
yes. One hasn’t seen Earth for al- 
most thirty years, though. Not 
since one was fourteen.” 

“You don’t look that old,” I 
said. 

“One reckons time in Earth- 
length years,” Schweiz explained. 



“By your figuring one is only ap- 
proaching the age of thirty.” 

“Also this one,” 1 said. “And 
here also is one who left his home- 
land before reaching manhood.” I 
was speaking freely, far more free- 
ly than was proper, yet I could not 
stop myself. I had drawn out 
Schweiz and felt an impulse to of- 
fer something of my own in re- 
turn. “Going out from Salla as a 
boy to seek his fortune in Glin, 
then finding better luck in Man- 
neran after a while. A wanderer, 
Schweiz, like yourself.” 

“It is a bond between us, then.” 
Could I presume on that bond? I 
asked him, “Why did you leave 
Earth?” 

“For the same reasons as every- 
one else. To go where the air is 
clean and a man stands some 
chance to become something. The 
only ones who spend their whole 
lives there are those who can’t help 
but stay.” 

“And this is the planet that all 
the galaxy reveres?” 1 said in won- 
der. “The world of so many myths! 
The planet of boys’ dreams! The 
center of the universe — a pimple, 
a boil!” 

“You put it well.” 

“Yet it is revered.” 

“Oh, revere it, revere it, certain- 
ly!” Schweiz cried. His eyes were 
aglow. “The fountain of man- 
kind! The grand originator of the 
species! Why not revere it, your 
grace? Revere the bold begin- 
nings that were made there. Re-

vere ihe high ambitions that 
sprang from its mud. And revere 
the terrible mistakes, too. An- 
cient Earth made mistake after 
mistake and choked itself in er- 
ror, so that you would be spared 
from having to pass through the 
same fires and torments." Schweiz 
laughed harshly. "Earth died to 
redeem you starfolk from sin. 
How's that for a religious no- 
tion? A whole liturgy could be 
composed around that idea. A 
priestcraft of Earth the redeem- 
er." Suddenly he leaned forward 
and asked, "Are you a religious 
man, your grace?" 

I was taken aback by the thrust- 
ing intimacy of his question. But I 
put up no barriers. 

“Certainly," 1 said. 

"You go to the godhouse, you 
talk to the drainers, the whole 
thing?" 

I WAS caught. 1 could not help 
but speak. 

"Yes," I said. "Does that sur- 
prise you?” 

“Not at all. Everyone on Bor- 
than seems to be genuinely reli- 
gious. Which amazes one. You 
know, your grace, one isn't re- 
ligious in the least, oneself. One 
tries, one has always tried, one has 
worked so hard to convince one- 
self that there are superior be- 
ings out there who guide des- 
tiny — and sometimes one almost 
makes it, your grace. One almost 
believes, one breaks through into 



faith, but then skepticism shuts 
things down every time. And one 
ends by saying. No, it isn't possi- 
ble, it can't be, it defies logic and 
common sense. Logic and com- 
mon sense!" 

"But how can you live all your 
days without a closeness to some- 
thing holy?" 1 asked. 

"Most of the time one manages 
fairly well. Most of the time." 

"And the rest of the time?" 

"That's when one feels the im- 
pact of knowing one is entirely 
alone in the universe. Naked under 
the stars and the starlight hitting 
the exposed skin, burning, a cold 
fire and no one to shield one from 
it, no one to offer a hiding place, no 
one to pray to, do you see? The sky 
is ice and the ground is ice and the 
soul is ice and who's to warm it? 
There isn't anyone. You've 
convinced yourself that no one 
exists who can give comfort. One 
wants some system of belief, one 
wants to submit, to get down and 
kneel, to be governed by meta- 
physics, you know? To believe, to 
have faith! And one can't. And 
that's when the terror sets in. The 
dry sobs. The nights of no sleep- 
ing.” Schweiz' face was flushed 
and wild with excitement; I 
wondered if he could be entirely 
sane. He reached across the desk, 
clamped his hand over mine — the 
gesture stunned me but I did not 
pull back — and said hoarsely, “Do 
you believe in gods, your grace?” 

“Surely.”

“In a literal way? You think 
there’s a god of travelers, a god of 
fishermen, a god of farmers and 
one who looks after septarchs 
and — ’’ 

“There is a forte,” I said, “that 
gives order and form to the uni- 
verse. The force manifests itself in 
various ways. And for the sake of 
bridging the gap between ourselves 
and that force, we regard each of 
its manifestations as a ‘god,’ yes, 
and extend our souls to this mani- 
festation or that one, as our needs 
demand. Those of us who are with- 
out learning accept these gods lit- 
erally, as beings with faces and per- 
sonalities. Others realize that they 
are metaphors for the aspects of 
the divine force— and not a tribe of 
potent spirits living overhead. But 
there is no one in Velada Borthan 
who denies the existence of the 
force itself.” 

“One feels such fierce envy of 
that,” said Schweiz. “To be raised 
in a culture that has coherence and 
structure, to have such assurance of 
ultimate verities, to feel oneself 
part of divine scheme — how mar- 
velous that must be! To enter a 
system of belief — it would almost 
be worth putting up with this so- 
ciety’s great flaws to have some- 
thing like that.” 

“Flaws?” Suddenly 1 found my- 
self on the defensive. “What 
flaws?” 

Schweiz narrowed his gaze and 
moistened his lips. Perhaps he was 
calculating whether I would be hurt 



or angered by what he meant to 
say. “Flaws was possibly too 
strong a word,” he replied. “One 
might say instead, this society’s 
limits, its — well, its narrowness. 
One speaks now of the necessity to 
shield one’s self from one’s fellow 
men that you impose. The taboos 
against reference to self, against 
frank discourse, against any open- 
ing of the soul — ” 

“Has one not opened his soul to 
you today in this very room?” 

“Ah,” Schweiz said, “but you’ve 
been speaking to an alien, to one 
who is no part of your culture, to 
someone you secretly suspect of 
having tendrils and fangs! Would 
you be so free with a citizen of 
Manneran?” 

“No one else in Manneran 
would have asked such questions as 
you have been asking.” 

“Maybe so. One lacks a native's 
training in self-repression. These 
questions about your philosophy of 
religion, then— do they intrude on 
your privacy of soul, your grace? 
Are they offensive to you?” 

“One has no objections to talk- 
ing of such things,” I said, without 
much conviction. 

“But it’s a taboo conversation, 
isn’t it? We weren’t using naughty 
words, except that once when one 
slipped, but we were dealing in 
naughty ideas, establishing a 
naughty relationship. You let your 
wall down a little way, eh? For 
which one is grateful. One's been 
here so long — years now — and one

hasn't ever talked freely with a 
man of Borthan, not once! Until 
one sensed today that you were 
willing to open yourself a bit. This 
has been an extraordinary experi- 
ence, your grace." The manic 
smile returned. He moved jerkily 
about the office. “One had no wish 
to speak critically of your way of 
life here," he said, “One wished in 
fact to praise certain aspects of it, 
while trying to understand others." 

“Which to praise, which to un- 
derstand?" 

“To understand your habit of 
erecting walls about yourselves. To 
praise the ease with which you 
accept divine presence. One envies 
you for that. As one said, one was 
raised in no system of belief at all 
and is unable to let himself be over- 
taken by faith. One’s head is 
always full of nasty skeptical ques- 
tions. One is constitutionally un- 
able to accept what one can’t see or 
feel and so one must always be 
alone. And one goes around the 
galaxy seeking for the gateway to 
belief, trying this, trying that, and 
one never finds " Schweiz 
paused. He was flushed and 
sweaty. “So you see, your grace, 
you have something precious here, 
this ability to let yourselves become 
part of a large power. One would 
wish to learn it from you. Of 
course, it’s a matter of cultural 
conditioning. Borthan still knows 
the gods and Earth has outlived 
them. Civilization is young on this 
planet. It takes thousands of years 



for the religious impulse to 
erode." 

“And," I said, “this planet was 
settled by men who had strong re- 
ligious beliefs, who specifically 
came here to preserve them and 
who took great pains to instill them 
in their descendants." 

“That, too. Your Covenant. Yet 
that was — what, fifteen hundred, 
two thousand years ago? It could 
all have crumbled by now, 'but it 
hasn’t. It’s stronger than ever. 
Your devoutness, your humility, 
your denial of self -” 

“Those who couldn’t accept and 
transmit the ideals of the first set- 
tlers,” 1 pointed out, “were not 
allowed to remain among them. 
That had its effect on the pattern of 
the culture. The consenters stayed; 
the rejecters went.” 

“You’re speaking of the exiles 
who went to Sumara Borthan?” 
“You know the story, then?" 
“Naturally. One picks up the 
history of whatever planet one 
happens to be assigned to. Sumara 
Borthan, yes. Have you ever been 
there, your grace?” 

“Few of us visit that continent," 
I said. 

“Ever thought of going?" 
“Never.” 

“There are those who do go 
there,” Schweiz said and gave me a 
strange smile. I meant to ask him 
about that, but at that moment a 
secretary entered with a stack of 
documents and Schweiz hastily 
rose. “One doesn’t wish to

consume too much of your grace’s 
valuable time. Perhaps this con- 
versation could be continued at an- 
other hour?” 

“One hopes for the pleasure of 
it,” I told him. 

W HEN Schweiz had gone 1 sat 
a long while with my back to 
my desk, closing my eyes and re- 
playing in my mind the things we 
had just said to one another. How 
readily he had slipped past my 
guard! How quickly we had begun 
to speak of inner matters! True, he 
was an otherworlder and with him 
I did not feel entirely bound by our 
customs. Yet we had grown dan- 
gerously close so extraordinarily 
fast. Ten minutes more and 1 
might have been as open as a bond- 
brother to him and he to me. 1 was 
astounded and dismayed by my 
easy dropping of propriety, by the 
way he had drawn me slyly into 
such intimacy. 

Was it wholly his doing? 1 had 
sent for him, 1 had been the first to 
ask the close questions. I had set 
the tone. He had sensed from that 
some instability in me and he had 
seized upon it, quickly flipping the 
conversation about, so that I was 
the subject and the interrogator. 
And 1 had gone along with it. Re- 
luctantly but yet willingly, 1 had 
opened to him. 1 was drawn to him 
and he to me. Schweiz the tempter! 
Schweiz the exploiter of my weak- 
ness, hidden so long, hidden even 
from myself! How could he have 



known I was ready to open? 

His high-pitched rapid speech 
still seemed to echo in the room. 
Asking. Asking. Asking. And then 
revealing. Are you a religious man? 
Do you believe in literal gods? If 
only I could find faith! How / envy 
you. But the flaws of your world. 
The denial of self. Would you be so 
free with a citizen of Manneran? 
Speak to me, your grace. Open to 
me. I have been alone here so long. 

How could he have known 
when 1 myself did not know? 

A strange friendship had been 
born. 1 asked Schweiz to dine at 
home with me; we feasted and 
talked, the blue wine of Salla 
flowed and the golden wine of 
Manneran — and when we were 
warmed by our drinking we dis- 
cussed religion once more: 
Schweiz’ difficulties with faith and 
my convictions that the gods were 
real. Halum came in and sat with 
us an hour. Afterward she 
remarked to me on the power of 
Schweiz to loosen tongues, saying, 
“You seemed more drunk than you 
have ever been, Kinnall. And yet 
you shared only three bottles of 
wine, so it must have been 
something else that made your eyes 
shine and your words so easy.” I 
laughed and told her that a 
recklessness came over me when 1 
was with the Earthman, that I 
found it hard to abide by custom 
with him. 

At our next meeting, in a tavern 
by the Justiciary, Schweiz said.

“You love your bondsister, eh?” 

“Of course one loves one’s 
bondsister.” 

“One means, though, you love 
her.” With a knowing snigger. 

1 drew back, tense. “Was one 
then so thoroughly wined the othei 
night? What did one say to you of 
her?” 

“Nothing,” he replied. “You 
said it all to her. With your eyes, 
with your smile. And no words 
passed.” 

“May we talk of other things?” 

“If your grace wishes.” 

“This is a tender theme — and 
painful.” 

“Pardon, then, your grace. One 
only meant to confirm one’s 
guess.” 

“Such love as that is forbidden 
among us.” 

“Which is not to say that it 
sometimes exists, eh?” Schweiz 
asked and clinked his glass against 
mine. 

In that moment I made up my 
mind never to meet with him again. 
He looked too deep and spoke too 
freely of what he saw. But four 
days afterward, coming upon him 
on a pier, I invited him to dine a 
second time. Loimel was displeased 
by the invitation. Nor would 
Halum come, pleading another 
engagement; when I pressed her, 
she said that Schweiz made her 
uncomfortable. Noim was in 
Manneran, though, and joined us 
at the table. We all drank sparing- 
ly and the conversation was a 



stilted and impersonal one until, 
with no perceptible shifting of 
tone, we found ourselves telling 
Schweiz of the time when I had es- 
caped from Salla in fear of my 
brother’s jealousies — and Schweiz 
was telling us of his departure 
from Earth. 

When the Earthman went home 
that night Noim said to me, not al- 
together disapprovingly, “There 
are devils in that man, Kinnall.” 

WWHIS taboo on self-expres- 
^ sion,” Schweiz asked me 
when we were together another 
time. “Can you explain it. your 
grace?” 

“You mean the prohibition 
against saying ‘T and 'me?' ” 

“Not that as much as the whole 
pattern of thought that would have 
you deny there are such things as 
‘I’ and 'me,’ he said. “The com- 
mandment that you must keep 
your private affairs private at all 
times, except only with bond-kin 
and drainers. The custom of wall- 
building around oneself that af- 
fects even your grammar.” 

“The Covenant, you mean?” 
“The Covenant,” said Schweiz. 
“You say you know our his- 
tory?” 

"Much of it.” 

“You know that our forefathers 
were stern folk from a northern 
climate, accustomed to hardship, 
mistrustful of luxury and ease, 
who came to Borthan to avoid

what they saw as the contamina- 
ting decadence of their native 
world?” 

“Was it so? One thought only 
that they were refugees from re- 
ligious persecution." 

“Refugees from sloth and self- 
indulgence,” 1 said. “They left 
Earth long ago, thousands of 
years ago, because they felt its 
ways were shameful, and settled 
on another world where they hoped 
they could live in the rightful path. 
And their ways hardened there, so 
that they were mocked by those 
who did not share their harsh be- 
liefs. So they migrated again, 
coming from that world to this. 
And, coming here, they established 
a code of conduct to pass down 
through the generations to protect 
their children's children against 
corruption.” 

“The Covenant.” 

“The Covenant, yes. The pledge 
they made each to each, the pledge 
that each of us makes to all his 
fellow men on his Naming Day. 
When we swear never to force our 
turmoils on another, when we 
vow to be strong-willed and hardy 
of spirit, so that the gods will con- 
tinue to smile on us. And so on 
and so on. We are trained to 
abominate the demon that is self.” 

“Demon?” 

“So we regard it. A tempting 
demon that urges us to make use 
of others instead of relying on our 
own strengths.” 

“Where there is no love of self. 



there is neither friendship nor 
sharing,” said Schweiz. 

“Perhaps so.” 

“And thus there is no trust.” 

“We specify areas of responsi- 
bility through contract,” I said. 
“There is no need for knowledge 
of the souls of others, where law 
rules. And in Velada Borthan no 
one questions the rule of law.” 

“You say you abominate self,” 
said Schweiz. “It seems, rather, 
that you glorify it.” 

“How so?” 

“By living apart from one an- 
other, each in the castle of his 
skull. Proud. Unbending. Aloof. 
Uncaring. The reign of self indeed, 
and no abomination of it!” 

“You put things oddly,” 1 said. 
“You invert our customs and 
think you speak wisely.” 

“Has it always been like this,” 
Schweiz asked, “since the begin- 
ning 01 settlement. 

“Yes,” 1 said. “Except among 
those malcontents you know of 
who fled to the southern continent. 
The rest of us abide by the Coven- 
ant. And our customs harden: thus 
we now may not talk of ourselves 
in the first person singular, since 
this is a raw exposure of self, but 
in medieval times this could be 
done. On the other hand, some 
things soften. Once we were guard- 
ed even in giving our names to 
strangers. We spoke to one an- 
other only when absolutely neces- 
sary. We show more trust nowa- 
days.”

“Bui not a great deal.” 

“But not a great deal," I admit- 
ted. 

“And is there no pain in this for 
you? Every man sealed against all 
others? Do you never say to your- 
selves that there must be a happier 
way for humans to live?” 

“We abide by the Covenant.” 
“With ease or with difficulty?” 
“With ease,” I said. “The pain 
is not so great when you consid- 
er that we have bond-kin, with 
whom we are exempted from the 
rule of selflessness. And the same 
with our drainers.” 

“To others, though, you may 
not complain, you may not unbur- 
den a sorrowful soul, you may not 
seek advice, you may not expose 
your desires and needs, you may 
not speak of dreams and fantasies 
and romance, you may not talk of 
anything but chilly, impersonal 
things.” Schweiz shuddred. “Par- 
don, your grace, but one finds this 
a harsh way to live. One’s own 
search has constantly been for 
warmth and love and human con- 
tact, for sharing, for opening — 
and this world seems to elevate the 
opposite of what one prizes most 
highly.” 

“Have you had much luck,” 1 
asked, “finding warmth and love 
and human contact?” 

Schweiz shrugged. “It has not 
always been easy.” 

“For us there is never loneliness, 
since we have bond-kin. With Hal- 
um, with Noim, with such as these 



to offer comfort, why does one 
need a world of strangers?” 

’'And if your bond-kin are not 
close at hand? If one is wandering, 
say, far from them in the snows of 
Glin?” 

“One suffers, then. And one's 
character grows tougher. But that 
is an exceptional situation. 
Schweiz, our system may force us 
into isolation, yet it also guaran- 
tees us love.” 

“But not the love of husband 
for wife. Not the love or father 
for child.” 

“Perhaps not.” 

“And even the love of bond-kin 
is limited. For you yourself, eh, 
have admitted that you feel a long- 
ing for your bonsister Halum that 
cannot be — ” 

I CUT him off, telling him sharp- 
ly, “Speak of other things!” 
Color flared in my cheeks; my skin 
grew hot. 

Schweiz nodded and smiled a 
chastened smile. “Pardon, your 
grace. The conversation became 
too intense; there was loss of con- 
trol but no injury meant.” 

“Very well.” 

“The reference was too person- 
al. One is abashed.” 

“You meant no injury, ” I said, 
guilty over my outburst, knowing 
he had stung me at a vulnerable 
place and that I had overreacted 
to the bite of truth. I poured more 
wine. We drank in silence for a 
time. 



A TIME OF CHANGES

Then Schweiz said, “May one 
make a proposal, your grace? 
May one invite you to take part 
in an experiment that may prove 
interesting and valuable to you?" 

“Go on," 1 said, frowning, ill at 
ease. * 

“You know," he began, “that 
one has long felt uncomfortably 
conscious of his solitary state in 
the universe -and that one has 
sought without success some 
means of comprehending his re- 
lationship to that universe. For 
you the method lies in religious 
faith, but one has failed to reach 
such faith because of his unfor- 
tunate compulsion toward total 
rationalism. Eh? One cannot 
break through to that larger sense 
of belonging by words alone, by 
prayer alone, by ritual alone. This 
thing is possible for you, and one 
envies you for it. One finds him- 
self trapped, isolated, sealed up in 
his skull, condemned to metaphy- 
sical solitude: a man apart, a man 
on his own. One does not find this 
state of godlessness enjoyable or 
desirable. You of Borthan can 
tolerate the sort of emotional iso- 
lation you impose on yourselves, 
since you have the consolations of 
your religion, you have drainers 
and whatever mystical mergings- 
with-the-gods the act of draining 
gives you; but the one who speaks 
to you now has no such advan- 
tages.” 

“All this we have discussed 
many times,” 1 said. “You spoke 



of a proposal, an experiment." 

“Be patient, your grace. One 
must explain oneself fully, step by 
step.” 

Schweiz flashed me his most 
charming smile and turned on me 
eyes that were bright with vision- 
ary schemes. His hands roamed 
the air expressively, conjuring up 
invisible drama as he said, “Per- 
haps your grace is aware that there 
are certain chemical substances 
drugs, yes, call them drugs that 
allow one to make an opening into 
the infinite or at least to have the 
illusion that one has made such 
an opening- to attain a brief and 
tentative glimpse into the mystic 
realms of the intangible. Eh? 
Known for thousands of years, 
these drugs, used in the days be- 
fore Earthmen ever went to the 
stars. Employed in ancient religi- 
ous rites. Employed by others as a 
substitute for religion, as a secu- 
lar means of finding faith, the 
gateway to the infinite for such as 
this one, who can get there no 
other way.” 

“Such drugs are forbidden in 
Velada Borthan,” I said. 

“Of course, of course! For you 
they offer a means of sidestep- 
ping the processes of formal reli- 
gion. Why waste time at a drain- 
er’s if you can expand your soul 
with a pill? Your law is wise on 
this point. Your Covenant could 
not survive if you allowed these 
chemicals to be used here.” 

“Your proposal, Schweiz?” 



172 



GALAXY 




“One first must tell you that he 
has used these drugs himself and 
found them not entirely satisfac- 
tory. True, they open the infinite. 
True, they let one merge with the 
Godhead. But only for moments: 
a few hours at best. And at the 
end of it one is as alone as before. 
It is the illusion of the soul's open- 
ing itself. Whereas this planet pro- 
duces a drug that can provide the 
real thing.” 

“What?" 

“In Sumara Borthan," said 
Schweiz, “dwell those who fled 
the rule of the Covenant. One is 
told that they are savages, going 
naked and living on roots and 
seeds and fish; the cloak of civili- 
zation has dropped away from 
them and they have slipped back 
into barbarism. So one learned 
from a traveler who had visited 
that continent not long ago. One 
also learned that in Sumara Bor- 
than they use a drug made from a 
certain powdered root, which has 
the capacity of opening mind to 

mind, so that each can read the 
inmost thoughts of the other. It is 
the very opposite of your Cove- 
nant, do you see? They know one 
another from the soul out, by way 
of this drug they eat." 

“One has heard stories of the 
savagery of those folk," 1 said. 

Schweiz put his face close to 

mine. “One confesses himself 
tempted by the Sumaran drug. 
One hopes that if he could ever get 
inside another mind he could find 



that community of soul for which 
he has searched so long. It might 
be the bridge to the infinite that he 
seeks, the spiritual transformation. 
Eh? In quest of revelations he has 
tried many substances. Why not 
this?" 

“If it exists." 

“It exists, your grace. This 
traveler who came from Sumara 
Borthan brought some of it with 
him to Manneran and sold some 
of it to the curious Earthman.” 
Schweiz drew forth from a pocket 
a small glossy envelope and held it 
toward me. It contained a small 
quantity of some white powder; it 
could have been sugar. “Here it 
is," he said. 

I stared at it as if he had pulled 
out a flask of poison. 

“Your proposal?" I demanded. 
“Your experiment, Schweiz?" 

“Let us share the Sumaran 
drug," he said.

I MIGHT have slapped the pow- 
der from his hand and ordered 
his arrest. I might have command- 
ed him to get away from me and 
never come near again. 1 might 
at the very least have cried out 
that it was impossible I would ever 
touch any such substance. But I 
did none of those things. I chose 
instead to be coolly intellectual, 
to show casual curiosity, to re- 
main calm and play conversation- 
al games with him. Thus I en-

couraged him to lead me a little 
deeper into the quicksand. 

I said, “Do you think that one 
is so eager to contravene the Co- 
venant?” 

“One thinks that you are a man 
of strong will and inquiring mind 
who would not miss an opportun- 
ity for enlightenment.” 

“Illegal enlightenment?” 

“All true enlightenment is il- 
legal at first, within its context. 
Even the religion of the Covenant: 
were your forefathers not driven 
out of other worlds for practicing 
it?” 

“One mistrusts such analogy. 
We are not talking of religions 
now. We talk of a dangerous drug. 
You ask one to surrender all the 
training of his lifetime and open 
himself to you as he has never 
done even to bond-kin — or even 
to a drainer.” 

“Yes.” 

“And you imagine that one 
might conceivably be willing to do 
such a thing?” 

“One imagines that you might 
well emerge transformed and 
cleansed, if you could bring your- 
self to try,” Schweiz said. 

“One might also emerge scarred 
and twisted.” 

“Doubtful. Knowledge never 
injures the soul. It only purges 
that which encrusts and saps the 
soul.” 

“How glib you are, Schweiz! 
Look, though: can you believe it 
would be possible to give one’s 



inner secrets to a stranger, to a 
foreigner, to an otherworlder?” 
“Why not? Better to a stranger 
than to a friend. Better to an 
Earthman than a fellow citizen. 
You’d have nothing to fear: the 
Earthman would never try to judge 
you by the standards of Borthan. 
There will be no criticisms, no 
disapprovals of what’s under your 
skull. And the Earthman will leave 
this planet in a year or two on a 
journey of hundreds of light-years 
—and what then will it matter 
that your mind once merged with 
his?” 

“Why are you so eager to have 
this merger happen?” 

“For eight moontimes,” he 
said, “this drug has been in one’s 
pocket, while one hunts for some- 
one to share it with. It looked as 
though the search would be in 
vain. Then one met you and saw 
your potential, your strength, your 
hidden rebelliousness — ” 

“One is aware of no rebellious- 
ness, Schweiz. One accepts his 
world completely.” 

“May one bring up the delicate 
matter of your attitude toward 
your bondsister? That seems a 
symptom of a fundamental dis- 
content with the restrictions of 
your society.” 

“Perhaps. Perhaps not.” 

“You would know yourself bet- 
ter after sampling the Sumaran 
drug. You would have fewer per- 
hapses and more certainties.” 

“How can you say this if you 



174 



GALAXY 




haven’t had the drug yourself?” 

“So it seems to one.” 

“It is impossible,” I said. 

“An experiment. A secret pact. 
No one would ever know.” 

“Impossible.” 

“Is it that you fear to share 
your soul?” 

“One is taught that such shar- 
ing is unholy.” 

“The teachings can be wrong,” 
he said. “Have you never felt the 
temptation? Have you never tasted 
such ecstasy in a draining that you 
wished you might undergo the 
same experience with someone you 
loved, your grace?” 

A gain he caught me in a vul- 
nerable place. “One has had 
such feelings occasionally,” 1 ad- 
mitted. “Sitting before some ugly 
drainer, and imagining he were 
Noim instead, or Halum, that the 
draining were a two-way flow - ” 
“Then you already long for this 
drug and don't realize it!" 

“No. No." 

“Perhaps,” Schweiz suggested, 
“it is the idea of opening to a 
stranger that dismays you and not 
the concept of opening itself. Per- 
haps you would take this drug 
with someone other than the 
Earthman, eh? With your bond- 
brother? With your bondsister?” 

1 considered that. Sitting down 
with Noim, who was to me like a 
second self, and reaching his mind 
on levels that had never been avail- 



able to me before and he reaching 
mine. Or with Halum — or with 
Halum — 

Schweiz, you tempter! 

He said, after letting me think a 
while, “Does the idea please you? 
Here, then. One will surrender his 
chance with the drug. Take it, use 
it, share it with one whom you 
love.” He pressed the envelope in- 
to my hand. It frightened me; I let 
it fall to the table as if it were 
aflame. 

I said, “But that would deprive 
you of your hoped-for fulfilment.” 

“No matter. One can get more 
of the drug. One may perhaps find 
another partner for the experi- 
ment. Meanwhile you would have 
known the ecstasy. Even an Earth- 
man can be unselfish. Take it, 
your grace. Take it.” 

I gave him a dark look. “Would 
it be, Schweiz, that this talk of 
taking the drug yourself was only 
pretense? That what you really 
look for is someone to offer him- 
self as an experimental subject, so 
you can be sure the drug is safe 
before you risk it?” 

“You misunderstand, your 
grace.” 

“Maybe not. Maybe this is what 
you’ve been driving toward.” I saw 
myself administering the drug to 
Noim, saw him falling into con- 
vulsions before my eyes as 1 made 
ready to bring my own dose to my 
lips. I pushed the envelope back to- 
ward Schweiz. “No. The offer is 
refused. One appreciates the gen- 



A TIME OF CHANGES 



175 




erosity, but one will not experi- 
ment on his loved ones, Schweiz.” 

His face was red. “This impli- 
cation is unwarranted, your grace. 
The offer to relinquish one's own 
share of the drug was made in 
good faith and at nojittle cost to 
one’s own plans. But since you re- 
ject it, let us return to the origi- 
nal proposition. The two of us will 
sample the drug, in secrecy, as an 
experiment in possibilities. Let us 
find out together what its powers 
may be and what doors it can open 
for us. We would have much to 
gain from this adventure, one is 
sure.” 

“One sees what you would have 
to gain,” I said. “But what pur- 
pose is there in it for — ” 

“Yourself?” Schweiz chuckled. 
Then he rammed me with the 
barbed hook. “Your grace, by 
making the experiment you would 
learn that the drug is safe, you 
would discover the proper dosage, 
you would lose your fear of the 
mind-opening itself. And then, 
after obtaining a further supply of 
the drug, you would be properly 
prepared to use it for a purpose 
from which your fears now hold 
you back. You could take the drug 
together with the only person 
whom you truly love. You could 
use it to open your mind to your 
bondsister Halum and to open 
hers to you.” 

T here is a story they tell chil- 
dren who are still learning the 



Covenant — about the days when 
the gods had not yet ceased to 
walk the world in human form 
and the first men had not yet ar- 
rived on Borthan. The gods at that 
time did not know they were di- 
vine, for they had no mortals 
about them for comparison, and 
so they were innocent beings, un- 
aware of their powers, who lived 
in a simple way. They dwelled in 
Manneran (this is the source of 
Manneran’s claim to superior holi- 
ness, the legend that it was once 
the home of the gods), ate berries 
and leaves and went without cloth- 
ing except in the mild Mannerangi 
winter, when they threw shawls of 
animal hide loosely over their 
shoulders. And there was nothing 
godlike about them. 

One day two of these ungodlike 
gods decided they would go off to 
see something of the world. The 
idea for making such a journey 
came first to the god whose secret 
name is Kinnall, now the god who 
looks after wayfarers. (Yes, he for 
whom I was named.) This Kinnall 
invited the goddess Thirga to join 
him, she whose responsibility now 
is the protection of those who are 
in love. Thirga shared Kinnall’s 
restlessness and off they went. 

From Manneran they walked 
west along the southern coast un- 
til they came to the shores of the 
Gulf of Sumar. Then they turned 
north and passed through Stroin 
Gap just by the place where the 
Huishtor Mountains come to an 



176 



GALAXY 




end. They entered the Wet Low- 
lands and stayed there a while, then 
proceeded to the Burnt Lowlands, 
which they found less to their lik- 
ing. Finally they ventured into the 
Frozen Lowlands, where they 
thought they would perish of the 
cold. So they turned south again 
and this time they also walked to 
the west and shortly found them- 
selves staring at the inland 
slopes of the Threishtor Moun- 
tains. There seemed no way for 
them to cross over this mighty 
range. They followed its eastern 
foothills south, but could not get 
out of the Burnt Lowlands and 
they suffered great hardships, un- 
til at last they stumbled upon 
Threish Gage. They made their 
way through that difficult pass 
into the cool and foggy province of 
Threish. 

On their first day in Threish the 
two gods discovered a place 
where a spring flowed out of a hill- 
side. The opening in the hillside 
was nine-sided and the rock sur- 
rounding the opening was so 
bright that it dazzled the eye. It 
rippled and iridesced and glowed 
with many colors constantly 
pulsing and changing, red and 
green and violet and ivory and tur- 
quoise and many more. And the 
water that came forth was of the 
same shimmering quality, hav- 
ing in it every color anyone ever 
had seen. The streem flowed only a 
short distance this way and then 
was lost in the waters of a much 



larger brook, in which all the won- 
drous colors vanished. 

Kinnall said, “We have wander- 
ed a long while in the Burnt Low- 
lands and our throats are dry from 
thirst. Shall we drink?" And 
Thirga said, “Yes, let us drink.” 
She kneeled by the opening in the 
hillside. She cupped her hands, 
filled them with the glittering 
water and poured it into her 
mouth. Kinnall drank also and the 
taste of the water was so sweet that 
they thrust their faces right against 
the flow of the spring, gulping 
down all they could. 

As they did this they exper- 
ienced strange sensations of their 
bodies and minds. Kinnall looked 
toward Thirga and realized that 
he could see the thoughts within 
her soul and they were thoughts of 
love for him. She looked toward 
him and saw his thoughts as well. 

“We are different now,” Kin- 
nall said and he did not even need 
words to convey his meaning, for 
Thirga understood him as soon as 
his thought formed. 

And she replied, “No, we are not 
different, but are merely able to 
understand the use of the gifts we 
have always had.” 

And it was true. For they had 
many gifts and they had never used 
them before. They could rise in the 
air and travel like birds; they could 
change the shapes of their bodies; 
they could walk through the Burnt 
Lowlands or the Frozen Low- 
lands and feel no discomfort; they 



ATIMEOFCHANGES 



177 




could live without taking in food; 
they could halt the aging of their 
flesh and become as young as they 
pleased; they could speak without 
saying words. All these things they 
might have done- before coming 
to the spring, except that they had 
not known how. Now they were 
capable of using the skills with 
which they had been born. They 
had learned, by drinking the wa- 
ter of the bright spring, how to go 
about being gods. 

E ven so, they did not yet know 
that they were gods. 

They drank at the wonderful 
spring again, but it taught them 
nothing that the first gulp had not 
already showed them, so they 
moved onward through Threish. 
Everything they beheld now was 
transformed, taking on a jeweled 
beauty, a magical luminous bril- 
liance, and they were stunned by 
the wonder of their change. And 
everything they saw they shared 
with one another, for their souls 
were in perfect communion and 
full harmony. 

After some time they remem- 
bered the others who lived in Man- 
neran, and flew back to tell them 
about the spring. The journey took 
only an instant. All their friends 
crowded around as Kinnall and 
Thirga spoke of the miracle of the 
spring and demonstrated the 
powers they had mastered. When 
they were done, everyone in Man- 
neran resolved to go to the spring. 



A long procession set out through 
Stroin Gap and the Wet Lowlands 
and up the eastern slopes of the 
Threishtors to Threish Gate. Kin- 
nall and Thirga flew above the 
travelers, guiding them from day 
to day. Eventually they reached 
the place of the spring and one by 
one they drank of it and became as 
gods. Then they scattered, some 
returning to Manneran, some 
going to Salla, some going even to 
Sumera Borthan or the far con- 
tinents of Umbis, Dabis and 
Tribis, since, now that they were as 
gods, there were no limits on the 
speed of their travel and they 
wished to see those strange places. 
But Kinnall and Thirga settled 
down beside the spring in eastern 
Threish and were content to ex- 
plore one another’s souls. 

Many years passed and the star- 
ship of our forefathers came 
down in Threish, near the western 
shore. Men had at last reached 
Borthan. They built a small town 
and went about the task of collec- 
ting food for themselves. A cer- 
tain man named Digant, who was 
among these settlers, ventured 
deep into the forest in search of 
meat animals. He became lost and 
roamed until finally he came to 
the place where Kinnall and 
Thirga lived. He had never seen 
any such as they before, nor they 
anyone such as he. 

“What sort of creatures are 
you?” he asked. 

Kinnall replied. “Once we were 



178 



ATIMEOFCHANGES 




quite ordinary, but now we do 
quite well, for we never grow old. 
We can fly faster than any bird, 
our souls are open to each other 
and we can take on any shape we 
please.” 

“Why, then you are gods!’’ 
Digant cried. 

“Gods? What are gods?” 

Digant explained that he was a 
man and had no such powers as 
theirs, for men must use words to 
talk and can neither fly nor change 
their shape. Men grow older with 
each journey of the world around 
the sun, until the time of dying 
comes. Kinnall and Thirga listen- 
ed with care, comparing them- 
selves to Digant, and when he was 
done speaking they knew it was 
true that he was a man and they 
were gods. 

“Once we were almost like men 
ourselves,” Thirga admitted. 
“We felt hunger and grew old and 
spoke only by means of words and 
had to put one foot in front of the 
other to get from place to place. 
We lived like men out of ignor- 
ance, for we did not know our pow- 
ers. But then things changed.” 

“And what changed them?” Dig- 
ant asked. 

“Why,” said Kinnall in his 
innocence, “we drank from that 
glistening spring and the water of 
it opened our eyes to our powers 
and allowed us to become as 
gods. That was all.” 

Then Digant’s soul surged with 
excitement, for he told himself 



that he, too, could drink from the 
spring and then he would Join this 
pair in godhood. He would keep 
the spring a secret afterward, 
when he returned to the settlers 
on the coast, and they would wor- 
ship him as their living god and 
treat him with reverence, or he 
would destroy them. But Digant 
did not dare ask Kinnall and 
Thirga to let him drink from the 
spring, for he feared that they 
would refuse him, being jealous 
of their divinity. So he hatched a 
scheme to get them away from that 
place. 

Is it true,” he asked them, 
“That you can travel so fast that 
you are able to visit every part of 
this world in a single day?” 

Kinnall assured him that this 
was true. 

“It seems difficult to believe,” 
said Digant. 

“We will give you proof,” 
Thirga said. 

She touched her hand to Kin- 
nail’s and the two gods went aloft. 
They soared to the highest peak of 
the Threishtors and gathered 
snowflowers there; they de- 
scended into the Burnt Lowlands 
and scooped up a handful of the 
red soil; in the Wet Lowlands they 
collected herbs; by the Gulf of 
Sumar they took some liquor from 
a fleshtree; on the shores of the 
Polar Gulf they pried up a sample 
of the eternal ice; then they leaped 
over the top of the world to frosty 
Tibis and began their journey 



GALAXY 



179 




through the far continents, so 
that they might bring back to the 
doubting Digant something from 
every part of the world. 

T he moment Kinnall and Thirga 
had departed oVi this enterprise 
Digant rushed to the spring of 
miracles. There he hesitated 
briefly, afraid that the gods might 
return suddenly and strike him 
down for his boldness; but they did 
not appear and Digant thrust his 
face into the Ilow and drank deep- 
ly, thinking. Now I, too, shall be 
as a god. He filled his gut with the 
glowing water, swayed, grew 
dizzy and fell to the ground. Is this 
godhood? He wondered. He tried 
to fly and could not. He tried to 
change his shape and could not. He 
failed in all these things because he 
had been a man to begin with and 
not a god. The spring could not 
change a man into a god, but could 
only help a god to realize his full 
powers. 

But the spring gave Digant one 
gift. It enabled him to reach into 
the minds of the other men who 
had settled in Threish. As he lay 
on the ground, numb with disap- 
pointment, he heard a tiny tick- 
ling sound in the middle of his 
mind and paid close heed to it and 
realized he was hearing the minds 
of his friends. And he found a way 
of amplifying the sound so that he 
could hear everything clearly: 
yes, and this was the mind of his 
wife, and this was the mind of his 



sister, and this was the mind of his 
sister's husband — Digant could 
look into any of them and any 
other mind, reading the inner- 
most thoughts. This is godhood, 
he told himself. And he probed 
their minds deeply, flushing out 
all their secrets. Steadily he in- 
creased the scope of his power 
until every mind at once was con- 
nected to his. Forth from them he 
drew the privacies of their souls, 
until, intoxicated with his new 
power, swollen with the pride of 
his godhood, he sent out a mess- 
age to all those minds from his 
mind, saying, “HEAR THE 
VOICE OF DIGANT. IT IS DI- 
GANT THE GOD THAT YOU 
SHALL WORSHIP. " 

When this terrible voice broke 
into their minds many of the set- 
tlers in Threish fell down dead with 
shock. Others lost their sanity and 
others ran about in wild terror, 
crying, “Digant has invaded our 
minds! Digant has invaded our 
minds!" And the waves of fear and 
pain coming out of them were so 
intense that Digant himself suf- 
fered greatly, falling into a paral- 
ysis and stupor, though his dazed 
mind continued to roar, “HEAR 
THE VOICE OF DIGANT. IT 
IS DIGANT THE GOD THAT 
YOU SHALL WORSHIP. " Each 
time that great cry went forth, 
more settlers died and more lost 
their reason and Digant, respond- 
ing to the mental tumults he had 
caused, writhed and shook in ag- 



180 



GALAXY 




ony, wholly unable to control the 
powers of his brain. 

Kinnal and Thirga were in Dabis 
when this occured, drawing forth 
from a marsh a triple-headed worm 
to show to Digant. The bellow- 
ings of Digant's mind sped around 
the world even to Dabis and, hear- 
ing those sounds, Kinnall and 
Thirga left off what they were do- 
ing and hurried back to Threish. 
They found Digant close to death, 
his brain all but burned out. They 
found the settlers of Threish dead 
or mad and they knew at once how 
this had come to pass. Swiftly they 
brought an end to Digant’s life, so 
that there would be silence in 
Threish. Then they went among the 
victims of the would-be god and 
raised all the dead and healed all 
the injured. And lastly they sealed 
the opening in the hillside with a 
seal that could not be broken, for it 
was plain to them that men must 
not drink of that spring, but only 
gods, and all the gods had already 
taken their draughts of it. 

The people of Threish fell on 
their knees before those two and 
asked in awe, “Who are you?” 

And Kinnall and Thirga replied, 
“We are gods and you are only 
men.” And that was the begin- 
ning of the end of the innocence 
of the gods. And after that time it 
was forbidden among men to seek 
ways of speaking mind to mind, 
because of the harm that Digant 
had done. And it was written into 
the Covenant that one must keep 



one's soul apart from the souls of 
others, since only gods can mingle 
souls without destroying one 
another and we are not gods. 

XII 

O F COURSE I found many 
reasons to postpone taking the 
Sumaran drug with Schweiz. First, 
High Justice Kalimol departed on 
a hunting trip and I told Schweiz 
that the doubled pressures of my 
work in his absence made it im- 
possible for me to undertake the 
experiment just then. Kalimol 
returned; Halum fell ill; I used my 
worry over her as the next excuse. 
Halum recovered; Noim invited 
Loimel and myself to spend a holi- 
day at his lodge in southern Salla. 
We came back from Salla; war 
broke out between Salla and Glin, 
creating complex maritime prob- 
lems for me at the Justiciary. And 
so the weeks went. Schweiz grew 
impatient. Did I mean to take the 
drug at all? 1 could not give him an 
answer. 1 did not truly know. But 
always there burned in me the 
temptation he had planted there. 
To reach out, godlike, and enter 
Halum’s soul. 

I went to the Stone Chapel, 
waited until Jidd could see me and 
let myself be drained. But I kept 
back from Jidd all mention of 
Schweiz and his drug, fearing to 
reveal that I toyed with such dan- 
gerous amusements. Therefore 
the draining was a failure, since I 



ATIME OF CHANGES 



181 




had not fully opened my soul to the 
drainer; and I left the Stone Chapel 
with a congestion of the spirit, 
tense and morose. 1 saw clearly 
now that I must necessarily yield 
to Schweiz, that* what he offered 
was an ordeal through which 1 
must pass, for there was no escap- 
ing it. He had found me out. Be- 
neath my piety I was a potential 
traitor to the Covenant. 1 went to 
him. 

“Today,” 1 said. “Now." 

E NEEDED seclusion. The 
Port Justiciary maintains a 
country lodge in the hills, two 
hours northwest of the city of 
Manneran, where visiting digni- 
taries are entertained and treaties 
of trade negotiated. I knew that 
this lodge was not currently in use 
and reserved it for myself for a 
three-day span. At midday I 
picked Schweiz up in a Justiciary 
car and drove quickly out of the 
city. 

The lodge had an excellent 
steam bath. We scrubbed our- 
selves vigorously and when we 
came out we donned loose, com- 
fortable silken robes. 1 felt 
frightened and uneasy and began 
to think that I would suffer some 
terrible harm out of this evening. 
Just then 1 regarded myself as 
one who was about to undergo 
surgery from which his chances of 
recovery were slight. My mood 
was sullen resignation: 1 was will- 
ing, I was here, 1 was eager to take 



the plunge and have done with it. 

“Your last chance," Schweiz 
said, grinning broadly. “You can 
still back out." 

“No." 

“You understand that there are 
risks, though? We are equally in- 
experienced in this drug. There 
are dangers." 

“Understood," I said. 

“Is it also understood that you 
enter this voluntarily and under 
no coercion?” 

1 said, “Why this delay, Schweiz? 
Bring out your potion." 

“One wishes to assure himself 
that your grace is fully prepared to 
meet any consequences.” 

In a tone of heavy sarcasm I 
said, “Perhaps there should be a 
contract between us, then, in the 
proper fashion, relieving you of 
any liability in case one wishes 
later to press a claim for damage 
to the personality — ” 

“If you wish, your grace. One 
does not feel it necessary." 

“One wasn’t serious,” 1 said. I 
was fidgety now. “Can it be that 
you’re nervous about it, too, 
Schweiz? That you have some 
doubts?" 

“We take a bold step.” 

“Let’s take it, then, before the 
moment goes by. Bring out the 
potion, Schweiz. Bring out the po- 
tion.” 

“Yes," he said. 

He gave me a long look, his eyes 
to mine, and clapped his hands in 
childlike glee. And laughed in tri- 




182 



GALAXY 




umph. I saw how he had man- 
ipulated me. Now 1 was begging 
him for the drug! Oh, devil, devil! 

From his traveling case he 
fetched the packet of white pow- 
der. He told me to get wine. 1 
ordered two flasks of chilled Man- 
nerangi golden from the kitchen 
and he dumped half the contents 
of the packet into my flask, half 
into his. The powder dissolved al- 
most instantly; for a moment it 
left a cloudy gray wake and then 
were was no trace of it. We grip- 
ped our flasks. 

“It should all go down at once," 
Schweiz said. He gulped his wine 
and I gulped mine. Then I sat 
back, expecting the drug to hit me 
instantly. I felt a faint giddiness, 
but that was only the wine doing 
its work in my empty gut. 

“How long does it take to be- 
gin?” 1 asked. 

Schweiz shrugged. “It will be 
some while yet.” 

We waited in silence. Testing 
myself, I tried to force my mind to 
go forth and encounter his, but 1 
felt nothing. The sounds of the 
room becase magnified: the creak 
of floorboards, the rasping of in- 
sects outside the window, the tiny 
hum of the bright electric light. 

“Can you explain,” 1 asked 
hoarsely, “the way this drug is 
thought to operate?” 

Schweiz answered, “One can tell 
you only what was told to him. 
Which is that the potential power 
to link one mind to another exists 



in all of us from birth, only we have 
evolved a chemical substance in 
the blood that inhibits the power. 
A very few are born without the 
inhibitor and these have the gift 
of reaching minds, but most of us 
are forever blocked from achiev- 
ing this silent communication, 
except when for some reason the 
production of the hormone ceases 
of its own accord and our minds 
open for a while. When this occurs 
it is often mistaken for madness. 
This drug of Sumara Borthan, 
they say, neutralizes the natural 
inhibitor in our blood- at least 
for a short time — and permits us 
to make contact with one an- 
other, as we would normally do if 
we lacked the counteracting sub- 
stance in the blood. So one has 
heard.” 

To this 1 answered, “We all 
might be supermen, then, but we 
are crippled by our own glands?” 

Schweiz, gesturing grandly, said, 
“Maybe it is that there were good 
biological reasons for evolving 
this protection against our own 
powers. Eh? Or maybe not.” He 
laughed. 

His face had turned very red. 1 
asked him if he really believed this 
story of an inhibitory hormone 
and a counterinhibitory drug 
and he said that he had no grounds 
for making judgment. 

“Do you feel anything yet?” 1 
asked. 

“Only the vvine,” he said. We 
waited. We waited. Perhaps it will

do nothing, I thought, and I will 
be reprieved. We waited. 

At length Schweiz said, “It may 
be beginning now." 

I WAS at first greatly aware of 
the functioning of my own body: 
the thud-thud of my heart, the 
pounding of the blood against the 
walls of arteries, the movements 
of fluids deep within my ears, the 
drifting of corpuscular bodies 
across my field of vision. 1 be- 
came enormously receptive to 
external stimuli: currents of air 
brushing my cheek, a fold of my 
robe touching my thigh, the press- 
ure of the floor against the sole of 
my foot. 1 heard an unfamiliar 
sound as of water tumbling 
through a distant gorge. I lost 
touch with my surroundings, for 
as my perceptions intensified 
the range of them also narrowed. 1 
found myself incapable of per- 
ceiving the shape of the room, for 1 
saw nothing clearly except in a 
constricted tunnel, at the other 
end of which was Schweiz; beyond 
the rim of this tunnel there was 
only haze. Now 1 was frightened 
and fought to clear my mind, as 
one may make a conscious effort 
to free the brain of the muddle 
caused by too much wine — but the 
harder I struggled to return to 
normal perception, the more ra- 
pidly did the pace of change ac- 
celerate. I entered a state of 
luminous drunkenness, in which 
brilliant radiant rods of colored 



light streamed past my face, and I 
was certain I must have sipped 
from Digant’s spring. 1 felt a rush- 
ing sensation, like that of air 
moving swiftly against my ears. I 
heard a high whining sound that 
was barely audible at first, but 
swept up in crescendo until it took 
on tangibility and appeared to fill 
the room to overflowing, yet the 
sound was not painful. The chair 
beneath me throbbed and pul- 
sated in a steady beat that seemed 
tuned to some patient pulsation 
of our planet itself. Then, with no 
discernible feeling of having 
crossed a boundary, 1 realized 
that my perceptions had for some 
time been double: now I was aware 
of a second heartbeat, of a sec- 
ond spurt of blood within vessels, 
of a second churning of intes- 
tines. But it was not mere dupli- 
cation, for these other rhythms 
were different, setting up complex 
symphonic interplays with the 
rhythms of my own body, creating 
percussive patterns that were so in- 
tricate that the fibers of my mind 
melted in the attempt to follow 
them. 1 began to sway in time with 
these beats, to clap my hands 
against my thighs, I saw Schweiz 
also swaying and clapping and 
snapping and realized whose 
bodily rhythms it was I had been 
receiving. We were locked to- 
gether. 1 had difficulty now dis- 
tinguishing his heartbeat from 
my own and sometimes, glancing 
across the table at him, I saw my 



184 



GALAXY 




own reddened, distorted face. I 
experienced a general liquefying of 
reality, a breaking down of walls 
and restraints; I was unable to 
maintain a sense of Kinnall Dari- 
val as an individual; I thought not 
in terms of he and /, but of we. I 
had lost not only my identity but 
the concept of self itself. 

At that level I remained a long 
while, until I started to think that 
the power of the drug was reced- 
ing. Colors grew less brilliant, my 
perception of the room became 
more conventional and I could 
again distinguish Schweiz’ body 
and mind from my own. Instead of 
feeling relief that the worst was 
over, though, I felt only disap- 
pointment that I had not achieved 
the kind of mingling of conscious- 
ness that Schweiz had promised. 

But I was mistaken. 

The first wild rush of the drug 
was over, yes — yet we were only 
now coming into the true com- 
munion. Schweiz and I were apart 
but nevertheless together. This 
was the real selfbaring. I saw his 
soul spread out before me as 
though on a table. I could walk up 
to the table and examine those 
things that were on it, picking up 
this utensil, that vase, these orna- 
ments, to study each as closely as I 
wished. 

Here was the looming face of 
Schweiz’ mother. Here was a swol- 
len pale breast streaked with blue 
veins and tipped by an enormous 
rigid nipple. Here were childhood 



furies. Here were memories of 
Earth. Through the eyes of 
Schweiz I saw the mother of 
worlds, maimed and shackled, dis- 
figured and discolored. Beauty 
gleamed through the ugliness. 
This was the place of his birth, this 
disheveled city; these were high- 
ways ten thousand years old; these 
were the stumps of ancient temples. 
Here was the node of first love. 
Here were disappointments and 
departures. Betrayals, here. Shared 
confidences, here. Growth and 
change. Corrosion and despair. 
Journeys. Failures. Seductions. 
Confessions. I saw the suns of a 
hundred worlds. 

And 1 passed through the strata 
of Schweiz' soul, inspecting the 
gritty layers of greed and the 
boulders of trickery, the oily 
pockets of maliciousness, the de- 
caying loam of opportunism. 
Here was self incarnate; here was 
a man who lived solely for his own 
sake. 

Yet I did not recoil from the 
darkness of Schweiz. 

I SAW beyond those things. I saw 
the yearning, the god-hunger in 
the man, Schweiz alone on a lunar 
plain, splayfooted on a black 
shield of rock under a purple sky, 
reaching up, grasping, taking 
hold of nothing. Sly and oppor- 
tunistic he might be, yes, but also 
vulnerable, passionate, honest 
beneath all his capering. I could 
not judge Schweiz harshly. He was 



A TIME OF CHANGES 



185 




I. 1 was he. Tides of self engulfed 
us both. If I were to cast Schweiz 
down, I must also cast down Kin- 
nall Darival. My soul was flooded 
with warmth for him. 

1 felt him, too, probing me. I 
erected no barriers about my spirit 
as he came to explore it. And 
through his own eyes I saw what he 
was seeing in me. My fear of my 
father. My awe of my brother. My 
love for Halum. My flight into 
Glin. My choosing of Loimel. My 
petty faults and my petty virtues. 
Everything, Schweiz. Look. Look. 
Look. And it all came back re- 
fracted through his soul, nor did I 
find it painful to observe. Love of 
others begins with love of self, 1 
thought suddenly. 

In that instant the Covenant fell 
and shattered within me. 

Gradually Schweiz and 1 pulled 
apart, though we remained in con- 
tact some time longer, the strength 
of the bond ebbing steadily. 
When it broke at last, I felt a 
shivering resonance, as if a taut 
string had snapped. We sat in 
silence. My eyes were closed. After 
some long time I looked across the 
room at Schweiz. 

He was watching me, waiting for 
me. He wore that demonic look of 
his, the wild grin, the bright-eyed 
gleam, only now it seemed to me 
less a look of madness than a re- 
flection of inner joy. He appear- 
ed younger now. His face was still 
flushed. 

“I love you,” he said softly. 



The unexpected words were 
bludgeons. I crossed my wrists be- 
fore my face, palms out, protect- 
ing myself. 

“What upsets you so much?” he 
asked. “My grammar or my 
meaning?” 

“Both.” 

“Can it be so terrible to say, / 
love youT' 

“One has never — one does not 
know how to — ” 

‘■To react? To respond?” 
Schweiz laughed. “1 don’t mean I 
love you in any physical way. As if 
that would be so hideous. But no. 1 
mean what I say, Kinnall. I’ve 
been in your mind and I liked what 
I saw there. 1 love you.” 

“You talk in ‘I,’ ” I reminded 
him. 

“Why not? Must I deny self even 
now? Come on — break free, Kin- 
nall. I know you want to. Do you 
think what I Just said to you is ob- 
scene?” 

“There is such a strangeness 
about it.” 

“Oh my world those words have 
a holy strangeness,” said Schweiz. 
“And here they’re an abomina- 
tion. Never to be allowed to say ‘I 
love you,’ eh? A whole planet deny- 
ing itself that little pleasure. Oh, 
no, Kinnall, no, no, no!” 

“Please,” I said faintly. “One 
still has not fully adjusted to the 
things the drug did. When you 
shout at one like that — ” 

But he would not subside. 

“You were in my mind too,” he 
said. “What did you find there? 



186 



GALAXY 




Was I so loathsome? Get it out, 
Kinnall. You have no secrets from 
me now. The truth. The truth!'’ 
“You know, then, that one found 
you more admirable than one had 
expected.” 

Schweiz chuckled. “And I the 
same! Why are we afraid of each 
other now, Kinnall? I told you: 1 
love you! We made contact. We 
saw there were areas of trust. Now 
we have to change, Kinnall. You 
more than I, because you have far- 
ther to go. Come. Come. Put words 
to your heart. Say it. 

“One can’t.” 

“Say M.’ ” 

“How difficult that is.” 

“Say it. Not as an obscenity. 
Say it as if you loved yourself.” 
“Please.” 

“Say it.” 

“I,” I said. 

“Was that so awful? Come, now. 
Tell me how you feel about me. 
The truth. From the deepest 
levels.” 

“A feeling of warmth — of affec- 
tion, of trust — ” 

“Of love?” 

“Of love, yes,” 1 admitted. 

“Then say it.” 

“Love.” 

“That isn’t what I want you to 
say.” 

“What, then?” 

“Something that hasn’t been 
said on this planet in two thousand 
years, Kinnall. Now — say it. I — ” 
“I” 

“Love you.” 



“Love you.” 

“1 love you.” 

“I — love — you.” 

“It’s a beginning,” Schweiz said. 
Sweat streamed down his face and 
mine. “We start by acknowledg- 
ing that we can love. We start by 
acknowledging that we have selves 
capable of loving. Then we begin 
to love. Eh? We begin to love.” 

XIII 

L ater I asked, “Did you get 
from the drug what you were 
looking for, Schweiz?” 

“Partially.” 

“How so, partially?” 

“I was looking for God, Kin- 
nall, and I didn’t quite find Him, 
but I got a better idea of where to 
look. What I did find was how not 
to be alone any more. How to open 
my mind fully to someone else. 
That’s the first step on the road 1 
want to travel.” 

“One is happy for your sake, 
Schweiz.” 

“Must you still talk to me in that 
third-person lingo?” 

“I can’t help myself,” I said. I 
was terribly tired. I was be- 
ginning to feel afraid of Schweiz 
again. The love 1 bore for him was 
still there, but now suspicion was 
creeping back. Was he exploiting 
me? Was he milking a dirty little 
pleasure out of our mutual ex- 
posures? He had pushed me into 
becoming a selfbarer. His insis- 
tence on my speaking in “I” and 



ATIME OF CHANGES 



187 




“me" to him was that a token of 
my liberation, was it something 
beautiful and pure, as he claimed, 
or was it only a reveling in filth? 1 
was too new to this. I could not sit 
placidly while a mah said, “/ love 
you" to me and compelled me to 
say to him, “/ love you." 

“Practice it," Schweiz said. “I. 
1. I. I.” 

“Stop. Please." 

“Is it that painful?" 

“It's new and strange to me. 1 
need there, you see? I need to 
slide into this more gradually." 

“Take your time, then. Don’t let 
me rush you. But don’t ever stop 
moving forward.” 

“One will try. / will try,” I said. 

“Good." After a moment he 
said, “Would you try the drug 
again, ever?" 

“With you?" 

“I don’t think there’s any need 
for that. I mean with someone like 
your bondsister. If I offered you 
some, would you use it with her?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“Are you afraid of the drug 
now?” 

1 shook my head. “That isn’t 
easy for me to answer. 1 need time 
to come to terms with the whole ex- 
perience. Time to think about it, 
Schweiz, before getting involved 
again.” 

“You’ve tasted the experience. 
You’ve seen that there’s only good 
to be had from it.” 

“Perhaps. Perhaps.” 

“Without doubt!” His fervor 



was evangelical. His zeal tempted 
me anew. 

Cautiously I said, “If more were 
available I would seriously con- 
sider trying it again. With Halum, 
maybe." 

“Good!" 

“Not immediately. But in time. 
Two, three, four moontimes from 
now." 

“It would have to be farther 
from now than that." 

“Why?" 

Schweiz said, “This was my en- 
tire stock of the drug that we used 
this evening. I have no more." 

“But you could get some if you 
tried?” 

“Oh, yes. Yes, certainly." 

“Where?” 

“In Sumara Borthan," he said. 

W HEN one is new to the ways of 
pleasure, it is not surprising to 
find guilt and remorse following 
first indulgence. So was it with 
me. In the morning of our second 
day at the lodge 1 awoke after 
troubled sleep, feeling such shame 
that I prayed the ground to swal- 
low me. What had 1 done? Why 
had I let Schweiz goad me into 
such foulness? Selfbaring! Self- 
baring! Sitting with him all night, 
saying “1” and “me” and “I,” and 
congratulating myself on my 
new freedom from convention’s 
strangling hand! The mists of day 
brought a mood of disbelief. 
Could I have actually opened my- 
self like that? Yes, I must, for with- 



188 



GALAXY 




in me now were memories of 
Schweiz’ past, to which I had not 
had access before. And myself 
within him, then. I prayed for a 
way of undoing what I had done. 
I felt I had lost something of my- 
self by surrendering my apart- 
ness. You know, to be a selfbarer 
is not a pretty thing among us and 
those who expose themselves gain 
only a dirty pleasure from it, a fur- 
tive kind of ecstasy. I insisted to 
myself that I had done nothing of 
that kind, but had embarked 
rather on a spiritual quest; but 
even as I put the phrase to myself 
it sounded portentous and hypo- 
critical, a flimsy mask for shabby 
motives. I was ashamed, for my 
sake, for my sons’ sakes, for the 
sake of my royal father and his 
royal forefathers, that 1 had come 
to this. I think it was Schweiz’ '7 
love you" that drove me into such 
an abyss of regret, more than any 
other single aspect of the evening, 
for my old self saw those words as 
doubly obscene, even while the 
new self that was struggling to 
emerge insisted that the Earth- 
man had meant nothing shame- 
ful, neither with his nor with 
his "love." But I rejected my own 
argument and let guilt engulf me. 
What had 1 become, to trade en- 
dearments with another man, an 
Earthborn merchant, a lunatic? 
How could I have given my soul to 
him? Where did 1 stand now that 1 
was so wholly vulnerable to him? 

That day I spent mostly alone. I 



went off into the forest and bathed 
at a cool pond; then I knelt before 
a firethorn tree and pretended it 
was a drainer and confessed my- 
self to it in whispers. Afterward I 
walked through a brambly woods, 
coming back to the lodge thorned 
and smudged. Schweiz asked me if 
I felt unwell. No, I told him, noth- 
ing was wrong. 1 said little that 
evening, but huddled in a float- 
ing-chair. The Earthman, more 
talkative than ever — a torrent of 
buoyant words — launched himself 
into the details of a grand scheme 
for an expedition to Sumara 
Borthan to bring back sacks of the 
drug, enough to transform every 
soul in Manneran. I listened 
without commenting, for every- 
thing had become unreal to me 
and his project seemed no more 
strange than anything else. 

I hoped the ache of my soul 
would ease once 1 was back in 
Manneran and at my desk in the 
Justiciary. But no. 1 came into my 
house and Halum was there with 
Loimel. They were exchanging 
clothes with one another and at 
the sight of them 1 nearly turned 
and fled. They smiled warm wo- 
man-smiles at me, secret smiles, 
the token of the league they had 
formed between themselves all 
their lives, and in despair I looked 
from my wife to my bondsister, 
from one cousin to the other, re- 
ceiving their mirrored beauty as a 
double sword in my belly. Those 
smiles! Those knowing eyes! They

needed no drug to pull the truths 
from me. 

Where have you been, Kinnall? 

To a lodge in the forest, to play 
at selfbaring with the Earthman. 

And did you shQw him your 
soul? 

Oh, yes, and he showed his. 

A nd then? 

Then we spoke of love. I love 
you, he said, and one replied, I love 
you. 

What a wicked child you are, 
Kinnall! 

Yes. Yes. Where can one hide 
from his shame? 

This silent dialog whirled 
through my brain in an instant, as 
1 came toward them where they 
sat beside the courtyard fountain. 
Formally 1 embraced Loimel, and 
formally I embraced my bond- 
sister, but I kept my eyes averted 
from theirs, so sharp was my guilt. 
It was the same in the Justiciary 
office for me. 1 translated the 
glances of the underlings into ac- 
cusing glares. There is Kinnall 
Darival, who revealed all our 
mysteries to Schweiz of Earth. 
Look at the Sallan selfbarer slink 
by us! How can he stand his own 
reek? 1 kept to myself and did my 
work poorly. A document con- 
cerning some transaction of 
Schweiz’ crossed my desk, throw- 
ing me into dismay. The thought 
of facing Schweiz ever again ap- 
palled me. It would have been no 
great chore for me to revoke his 
residence permit in Manneran, us- 



ing the authority of the High Jus- 
tice; poor payment for the trust he 
showed me, but 1 came close to 
doing it, and checked myself only 
out of a deeper shame even than 1 
already bore. 

O N THE third day of my return, 
when my children too had begun 
to wonder what was wrong with 
me, 1 went to the Stone Chapel to 
seek healing from the drainer 
Jidd. 

It was a damp day of heavy heat. 
The soft furry sky seemed to hang 
in looping folds over Manneran 
and everything was coated in 
glistening beads of bright mois- 
ture. That day the sunlight was a 
strange color, almost white, and 
the ancient black stone blocks of 
the holy building gave off blind- 
ing reflections as though they 
were edged with prisms. But inside 
the chapel I found myself in dark, 
cool, quiet halls. Jidd’s cell had 
pride of place in the chapel’s apse, 
behind the great altar. He awaited 
me already robed; 1 had reserved 
his time hours in advance. The 
contract was ready. Quickly 1 
signed and gave him his fee. This 
Jidd was no more lovely than any 
other of this trade, but just then 1 
was almost pleased by his ugliness, 
his jagged knobby nose and thin 
long lips, his hooded eyes, his dang- 
ling earlobes. Why mock the man’s 
face? He would have chosen 
another for himself if he had been 
consulted. And 1 was kindly dis- 



190 



GALAXY 




posed to him, for I hoped he would 
heal me. Healers were holy men. 
Give me what I need from you, 
Jidd, and / will bless your ugly 
face! 

He asked, “Under whose aus- 
pices will you drain?” 

“The god of forgiving." 

He touched a switch. Mere 
candles were too common for 
Jidd. The amber light of forgive- 
ness came from some concealed 
gas jet and flooded the chamber. 
Jidd directed my attention to- 
ward the mirror, instructing me 
to behold my face, put my eyes to 
my eyes. The eyes of a stranger 
looked back at me. Droplets of 
sweat clustered in the roots of my 
beard, where the flesh of my cheeks 
could be seen. / love you, 1 said si- 
lently to the strange face in the mir- 
ror. Love of others begins with 
love of self. The chapel weighed on 
me; 1 was in terror of being 
crushed beneath a block of the ceil- 
ing. Jidd was saying the pre- 
liminary words. There was noth- 
ing of love in them. He com- 
manded me to open my soul to 
him. 

1 stammered. My tongue turned 
upon itself and was knotted. 1 
gagged; 1 choked; 1 pulled my head 
down and pressed it to the cold 
floor. Jidd touched my shoulder 
and murmured formulas of com- 
fort until my fit softened. We be- 
gan the rite a second time. Now I 
traveled more smoothly through 
the preliminaries and, when he 



asked me to speak, 1 said, as 
though reciting lines that had been 
written for me by someone else, 
“These days past one went to a 
secret place with another. We 
shared a certain drug of Sumara 
Borthan that unseals the soul and 
we engaged in selfbaring to- 
gether. Now one feels remorse for 
his sin and would have forgive- 
ness for it.” 

Jidd gasped, and it is no little 
task to astonish a drainer. That 
gasp nearly punctured my will to 
confess; but Jidd artfully recov- 
ered control, coaxing me onward 
with bland priestly phrases, until 
in a few moments the stiffness left 
my jaws and 1 was spilling out 
everthing. My early discussions 
of the drug with Schweiz. (1 left 
him unnamed. Though 1 trusted 
Jidd to maintain the secrecy of the 
draining, 1 saw no spiritual gain 
for myself in revealing to any- 
one the name of my companion in 
sin.) My taking of the drug at the 
lodge. My sensations as the drug 
took hold. My exploration of 
Schweiz' soul. His entry into mine. 
The kindling of deep affection 
between us as our union of spirit 
developed. My feeling of aliena- 
tion from the Covenant while un- 
der the drug’s influence. That sud- 
den conviction of mine that the 
denial of self which we practice is 
a catastrophic cultural error. The 
intuitive realization that we should 
deny our solitude instead and seek 
to bridge the gulfs between our- 



ATIMEOF CHANGES 



191 




selves and others, rather than 
glorying in isolation. Also 1 con- 
fessed that 1 had dabbled in the 
drug for the sake of eventually 
reaching the soul of Halum; hear- 
ing from me this admission of 
yearning for my bondsister was 
old stuff to Jidd by now. And then 1 
spoke of the dislocations 1 had 
experienced since coming out of 
my drug trance; the guilt, the 
shame, the doubt. At last 1 fell 
silent. Before me hung the facts of 
my misdeeds, tangible and ex- 
posed and already 1 felt cleaner 
for having revealed them. 1 was 
willing now to be brought back 
into the Covenant. I wanted to be 
purged of my aberration of self- 
baring. 1 hungered to do penance 
and resume my upright life. 1 was 
eager to be healed, 1 was begging 
for absolution and restoration 
to my community. But 1 could not 
feel the presence of the god. Star- 
ing into the mirror, 1 saw only my 
own face, drawn and shallow, the 
beard in need of combing. When 
Jidd began to recite the formulas 
of absolution, they were merely 
words to me, nor did my soul lift. 1 
was cut off from all faith. The 
irony of that distracted me: 
Schweiz, envying me for my be- 
liefs, seeking through the drug to 
understand the mystery of sub- 
mission to the supernatural, had 
stripped me of my access to the 
gods. There 1 kneeled, stone knees 
on stone floor, making hollow re- 
sponses to Jidd’s hollow phrases, 
while wishing that Jidd and 1 



could have taken the drug to- 
gether, so there might have been 
true communion between us. And 
I knew that I was lost. 

“The peace of the gods be with 
you now,” said Jidd. 

“The peace of the gods is upon 
one.” 

“Seek no more for false succor 
and keep your self to yourself, for 
other paths lead only to shame and 
corruption.” 

“One will seek no other paths.” 
“You have bondsister and 
bondbrother, you have a drainer, 
you have the mercies of the gods. 
You need no more.” 

“One needs no more.” 

“Go in peace, then.” 

I went, but not in his kind of 
peace, for the draining had been a 
leaden thing, meaningless and 
trifling. Jidd had not reconciled 
me to the Covenant — he had 
simply demonstrated the degree 
of my separation from it. Un- 
moved though 1 had been by the 
draining, however, 1 emerged 
from the Stone Chapel somehow 
purged of guilt. 1 no longer re- 
pented my selfbaring. Perhaps 
this was some residual effect of the 
draining, this inversion of my 
purpose in going to Jidd, but 1 did 
not try deeply to analyze it. I was 
content to be myself and to be 
thinking these thoughts. My con- 
version at that instant was com- 
plete. Schweiz had taken my faith 
from me, but he had given me an- 
other in its place.

The doctor told me/'Marguerite,you can be alive and ugly, 
or beautiful and dead” 



The day I fit$l noliced the small pink spot on my 
cheek, I had other things on my mind. The New York 
papers said, "Marguerite Piazza opens at the Persian 
Room". I covered the spot with makeup, walked out 
into the spollicjlil, and forgot it— forgot everything— 
in the joy of singing. 

It wasn't until the spot began to spread, that 1 went 
to a cancer specialist. The day the doctor told me I'd 
hove to have radical face surgery, I was sure my career 
was over. It was no longer a matter of saving my looks. 
Just of saving my life. 

They kept the mirrors in my hospital room covered 
for a week. And yet today, thanks to the fontastic skill 



of the surgeons, I sing in the spotlight again. I let myself 
be photographed fuM-fbce by a famous photogroplier 
of glamorous women, And I am alive. 

So now you know why I am appealing to you on 
behalf of the American Cancer Society. To give money, 
To get regular checkups. And to pay attention lo can- 
cer's warning signals. 

You know, there's something much worse tlxin find-

lives, disposable goods, impermanent alle- 
giances. We entered the plug-in, throw-away, 
rent-a-thing, forget-a-person age. We began 
using up products, ideas, people at a dizzying 
rate. 

Some people thrive on the pace. Others 
find it terrifying. Some simply refuse to recog- 
nize it, abruptly colliding with the future and 
suffering an adaptive breakdo..r> AKin Tof-
