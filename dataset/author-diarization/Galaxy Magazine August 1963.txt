SPACEWAR, 1963 



¥3 EMEMBER M.I.T.’s indus- 
trial design course a few 
years ago? It was a simple term 
project, designing cars, clothes, 
houses and so on for an export 
market . except that the export 
market was a little remote, being 
a planet of the star Arcturus, and 
the customers were three-legged, 
light-framed, non-human — and 
imaginary. 

Well, they’ve done it again. 
This time it’s M.I.T.’s computer 
section that is borrowing from the 
science-fiction magazines. We 
dropped in not long ago to see 
what was going on and had the 
unanticipated pleasure of fight- 
ing a full-fledged space war. 

The hardware behind the game 
is a computer, programmed with 
all it needs to know about space 
navigation, rocket speeds, etc., so 
that when you operate a simple 
control you can send a little rock- 
et ship across a cathode-screen 
readout. Swing your control to 
the left and the ship swerves to 
the left. Push the acceleration 
button and it zooms ahead. Put 
all controls neutral and it drifts. 



Fun? Sure, but that’s only the 
beginning. Feed in a few more in- 
structions and your rocket be- 
comes a battleship equipped with 
a dozen space torpedoes. You can 
fire them at will, and whatever 
you hit with them on the screen 
goes up in a satisfying, soundless 
pyrotechnic flare. Another tape 
puts another ship on the screen, 
with its own controls and its own 
torpedoes. Go ahead: You be 
Dick Seaton and we’ll be the 
Fenachrone, and may the best 
space warrior win . 

Want more excitement? Add 
another tape, and one of your 
controls will shoot you into hyper- 
space at a critical moment. Your 
ship disappears from the tube, 
and reappears, a random interval 
later, at a random point in space 
. It’s a lovely game! 

— And, no doubt, an educa- 
tional one for the future computer 
designers who are thus learning 
what the darn things are capable 
of. But educational or not, we 
enjoyed it. 

Somebody up there likes us!

Secrets 
entrusted 
to a 
few 



THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some— but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

Mercury had no atmosphere 
— everyone knew that. Why 
was it developing one now? 



I 

WIND which had nearly 
turned the Albireo’s landing 
into a disaster instead of a mathe- 
matical exercise was still playing 
tunes about the fins and landing 
legs as Schlossberg made his way 
down to Deck Five. 

The noise didn’t bother him par- 
ticularly, though the endless seis- 
mic tremors made him dislike the 
ladders. But just now he was able 
to ignore both. He was curious — 
though not hopeful. 

“Is there anything at all ob- 
vious on the last sets of tapes, 
Joe?” 

Mardikian, the geophysicist, 
shrugged. “Just what you’d ex- 
pect ... on a planet which has at 
least one quake in each fifty-mile- 
square area every five minutes. 
You know yourself we had a nice 
seismic program set up, but when 
we touched down we found we 
couldn’t carry it out. We’ve done 
our best with the natural tremors 
— incidentally stealing most of 
the record tapes the other pro- 
jects would have used. We have 
a lot of nice information for the 
computers back home; but it will 



take all of them to make any 
sense out of it.” 

Schlossberg nodded; the words 
had not been necessary. His as- 
tronomical program had been one 
of those sabotaged by the transfer 
of tapes to the seismic survey. 

“I just hoped,” he said. “We 
each have an idea why Mercury 
developed an atmosphere during 
the last few decades, but I guess 
the high school kids on Earth will 
know whether it’s right before we 
do. I’m resigned to living in a 
chess-type universe — few and 
simple rules, but infinite com- 
binations of them. But it would 
be nice to know an answer some- 
time.” 

“So it would. As a matter of 
fact, I need to know a couple 
right now. From you. How close 
to finished are the other programs 
— or what’s left of them?” 

“I’m all set,” replied Schloss- 
berg. “I have a couple of instru- 
ments still monitoring the sun 
just in case, but everything in the 
revised program is on tape.” 
“Good. Tom, any use asking 
you?” 

The biologist grimaced. “I’ve 
been shown two hundred and six- 



8 



GALAXY 



teen different samples of rock and 
dust. I ha^e examined in detail 
twelve crystal growths which 
looked vaguely like vegetation. 
Nothing was alive or contained 
living things by any standards I 
could conscientiously set.” 

Mardikian’s gesture might have 
meant sympathy. 

“Camille?” 

“I may as well stop now as any 
time. I’ll never be through. Tape 
didn’t make much difference to 
me, but I wish I knew what 
weight of specimens I could take 
home.” 

“Eileen?” Mardikian’s glance 
at the stratigrapher took the place 
of the actual question. 

“Cam speaks for me, except 
that I could have used any more 
tape you could have spared. What 
I have is gone.” 

“All right, that leaves me, the 
tape-thief. The last spools are in 
the seismographs now, and will 
start running out in seventeen 
hours. The tractors will start out 
on their last rounds in sixteen, 
and should be back in roughly a 
week. Will, does that give you 
enough to figure the weights we 
rockhounds can have on the re- 
turn trip?” 

>’|''HE ALBIREO’S captain nod- 
ded. “Close enough. There 
really hasn’t been much question 
since it became evident we’d find 
nothing for the mass tanks here. 



I’ll have a really precise check in 
an hour, but I can tell right now 
that you have about one and a 
half metric tons to split up among 
the three of you. 

“Ideal departure time is three 
hundred ten hours away, as you 
all know. We can stay here until 
then, or go into a parking-and- 
survey orbit at almost any time 
before then. You have all the sur- 
vey you need, I should think, 
from the other time. But suit 
yourselves.” 

“I’d just as soon be space-sick 
as seasick,” remarked Camille 
Burkett. “I still hate to think that 
the entire planet is as shivery as 
the spot we picked.” 

Willard Rowson smiled. “You 
researchers told me where to land 
after ten days in orbit mapping 
this rockball. I set you just where 
you asked. If you’d found even 
five tons of juice we could use in 
the reaction tanks I could still 
take you to another one ■ — if you 
could agree which one. I hate to 
say ‘Don’t blame me,’ but I can’t 
think of anything else that fits.” 

“So we sit until the last of the 
tractors is back with the precious 
seismo tapes, playing battleship 
while our back teeth are being 
shaken out by earthquakes — ex- 
cuse the word. What a thrill! 
Glorious adventure!” Zaino, the 
communications specialist who 
had been out of a job almost con- 
stantly since the landing, spoke 



HOT PLANET 



9 



sourly. The captain was the only 
one who saw fit to answer. 

“If you want adventure, you 
made a mistake exploring space. 
The only space adventures I’ve 
heard of are second-hand stories 
built on guesswork; the people 
who really had them weren’t 
around to tell about it. Unless Dr. 
Marini discovers a set of Mer- 
curian monsters at the last minute 
and they invade the ship or cut 
off one of the tractors, I’m afraid 
you’ll have to do without adven- 
tures.” Zaino grimaced. 

“That sounds funny coming 
from a spaceman. Captain. I 
didn’t really mean adventure, 
though; all I want is something to 
do besides betting whether the 
next quake will come in one min- 
ute or five. I haven’t even had to 
fix a suit-radio since we touched 
down. How about my going out 
with one of the tractors on this 
last trip, at least?” 

“It’s all right with me,” replied 
Rowson, “but Dr. Mardikian runs 
the professional part of this oper- 
ation. I require that Spurr, Track- 
man, Hargedon and Aiello go as 
drivers, since without them even 
a minor mechanical problem 
would be more than an adven- 
ture. As I recall it. Dr. Harmon, 
Dr. Schlossberg, Dr. Marini and 
Dr. Mardikian are scheduled to 
go; but if any one of them is 
willing to let you take his or her 
place, I certainly don’t mind.” 



The radioman looked around 
hopefully. The geologists and the 
biologist shook their heads nega- 
tively, firmly and unanimously; 
but the astronomer pondered for 
a moment. Zaino watched tensely. 

“It may be all right,” Schloss- 
berg said at last. “What I want 
to get is a set of wind, gas pres- 
sure, gas temperature and gas 
composition measures around the 
route. I didn’t expect to be more 
meteorologist than astronomer 
when we left Earth, and didn’t 
have exactly the right equipment. 
Hargedon and Aiello helped me 
improvise some, and this is the 
first chance to use it on Darkside. 
If you can learn what has to be 
done with it before starting time, 
though, you are welcome to my 
place.” 

'T'HE COMMUNICATOR got 

to his feet fast enough to 
leave the deck in Mercury’s 
feeble gravity. 

“Lead me to it. Doc. I guess I 
can learn to read a home-made 
weathervane!” 

“Is that merely bragging, or a 
challenge?” drawled a voice 
which had not previously joined 
•the discussion. Zaino flushed a 
bit. 

“Sorry, Luigi,” he said hastily. 
“I didn’t mean it just that way. 
But I still think I can run the 
stuff.” 

“Likely enough,” Aiello replied.

grudges. Matter of fact, I’m even 
a little uneasy about having the 
girls along, though I’m no miso- 
gynist.” 

“Girls? They’re not — ” 

“There goes your foot again. 
Even Harmon is about ten years 
older than you, I suppose. But 
they’re girls to me. What’s more 
important, they no doubt think 
of themselves as girls.” 

“Even Dr. Burkett? That is — 
I mean — ” 

“Even Dr. Burkett. Here, get 
into your suit. And maybe you’d 
better take out the mike. It’ll be 
enough if you can listen for the 
next hour or two.” Zaino made no 
answer, suspecting with some jus- 
tice that anything he said would 
be wrong. 

Each made final checks on the 
other’s suit; then they descended 
one more level to the airlock. 
This occupied part of the same 
deck as the fusion plants, below 
the wings and reaction mass tanks 
but above the main engine. Its 



“Remember though, it wasn’t 
made just for talking into.” 
Schlossberg, now on his feet, cut 
in quickly. 

“Come on, Arnie. We’ll have to 
suit up to see the equipment; it’s 
outside.” 

He shepherded the radioman to 
the hatch at one side of the deck 
and shooed him down toward the 
engine and air lock levels. Both 
were silent for some moments; 
but safely out of earshot of Deck 
Five the younger man looked up 
and spoke. 

“You needn’t push. Doc. I 
wasn’t going to make anything of 
it. Luigi was right, and I asked for 
it.” The astronomer slowed a bit 
in his descent. 

“I wasn’t really worried,” he 
replied, “but we have several 
months yet before we can get 
away from each other, and I don’t 
like talk that could set up

outer door was just barely big 
enough to admit a spacesuited 
person. Even with the low air 
pressure carried by spaceships, a 
large door area meant large total 
force on jamb, hinges and locks. 
It opened onto a small balcony 
from which a ladder led to the 
ground. The two men paused on 
the balcony to look over the 
landscape. 

This hadn’t changed noticeably 
since the last time either had been 
out, though there might have 
been some small difference in the 
volcanic cones a couple of miles 
away to the northeast. The fur- 
rows down the sides of these, 
which looked as though they had 
been cut by water but were ac- 
tually bone-dry ash slides, were 
always undergoing alteration as 
gas from below kept blowing fresh 
scoria fragments out of the cra- 
ters. 

^1 ■'HE SPINES — steep, jagged 
-*■ fragments of rock which thrust 
upward from the plain beyond 
and to both sides of the cones — 
seemed dead as ever. 

The level surface between the 
Albireo and the cones was 
more interesting. Mardikian and 
Schlossberg believed it to be a 
lava sheet dating from early in 
Mercury’s history, when more 
volatile substances still existed 
in the surface rocks to cut down 
their viscosity when molten. They 



supposed that much — perhaps 
most — of the surface around 
the “twilight” belt had been 
flooded by this very liquid lava, 
which had cooled to a smoother 
surface than most Earthly lava 
flows. 

How long it had stayed cool 
they didn’t guess. But both men 
felt sure that Mercury must have 
periodic upheavals as heat ac- 
cumulated inside it — heat com- 
ing not from radioactivity but 
from tidal energy. Mercury’s or- 
bit is l^ighly eccentric. At peri- 
helion, tidal force tries to pull it 
apart along the planet-to-sun line, 
while at aphelion the tidal force 
is less and the little world’s own 
gravity tries to bring it back to 
a spherical shape. The real change 
in form is not great, but a large 
force working through even a 
small amount of distance can 
mean a good deal of energy. 

If the energy can’t leak out — 
and Mercury’s rocks conduct heat 
no better than those of Earth 
— the temperature must rise. 

Sooner or later, the men ar- 
gued, deeply buried rock must 
fuse to magma. Its liquefaction 
would let the bulk of the planet 
give farther under tidal stress, so 
heat would be generated even 
faster. Eventually a girdle of mag- 
ma would have to form far be- 
low the crust all around the twi- 
light strip, where the tidal strain 
would be greatest. Sooner or later 



12 



GALAXY 



this would melt its way to the 
surface, giving the zone a period 
of intense volcanic activity and, 
incidentally, giving the planet a 
temporary atmosphere. 

The idea was reasonable. It 
had, the astronomer admitted, 
been suggested long before to 
account for supposed vulcanism 
on the moon. It justified the care- 
ful examination that Schlossberg 
and Zaino gave the plain before 
they descended the ladder; for it 
made reasonable the occasional 
changes which were observed to 
occur in the pattern of cracks 
weaving over its surface. 

No one was certain just how 
permanent the local surface was 
— though no one could really 
justify feeling safer on board the 
Albireo than outside on the lava. 
If anything really drastic hap>- 
pened, the ship would be no pro- 
tection. 

The sun, hanging just above 
the horizon slightly to the A^atch- 
er’s right, cast long shadows which 
made the cracks stand out clear- 
ly; as far as either man could see, 
nothing had changed recently. 
They descended the ladder care- 
fully — even the best designed 
spacesuits are somewhat vulner- 
able — and made their way to 
the spot where the tractors were 
parked. 

A sheet-metal fence a dozen 
feet high and four times as long 
provided shade, which was more 



than a luxury this close to the 
sun. The tractors were parked in 
this shadow, and beside and be- 
tween them were piles of equip- 
ment and specimens. The appara- 
tus Schlossberg had devised was 
beside the tractor at the north 
end of the line, just inside the 
shaded area. 

It was still just inside the shade 
when they finished, four hours 
later. Hargedon had joined them 
during the final hour and helped 
pack the equipment in the tractor 
he was to drive. Zaino had had 
no trouble in learning to make 
the observations Schlossberg 
wanted, and the youngster was 
almost unbearably cocky. Schloss- 
berg hoped, as they returned to 
the Albireo, that no one would 
murder the communications ex- 
pert in the next twelve hours. 
There would be nothing to worry 
about after the trip started; 
Hargedon was quite able to keep 
anyone in his place without being 
nasty about it. If Zaino had been 
going with Aiello or Harmon — 
but he wasn’t, and it was point- 
less to dream up trouble. 

And no trouble developed all 
by itself. 

II 

^AINO WAS not only still alive 
^ but still reasonably popular 
when the first of the tractors set 
out, carrying Eileen Harmon and 



HOT PLANET 



13 



Eric Trackman, the Albireo’s nu- 
clear engineer. 

It started more than an hour 
before the others, since the 
stratigrapher’s drilling program, 
“done” or not, took extra time. 
The tractor hummed off to the 
south, since both Darkside routes 
required a long detour to pass the 
chasm to the west. Routes had 
been worked out from the stereo- 
photos taken during the orbital 
survey. Even Darkside had been 
covered fairly well with Uniquan- 
tum film under Venus light. 

The Harmon-Trackman vehi- 
cle was well out of sight when 
Mardikian and Aiello started out 
on one of the Brightside routes, 
and a few minutes later Marini 
set out on the other with the 
spacesuit technician, Mary Spurr, 
driving. 

Both vehicles disappeared 
quickly into a valley to the 
northeast, between the ash cones 
and a thousand-foot spine which 
rose just south of them. All the 
tractors were in good radio con- 
tact; Zaino made sure of that be- 
fore he abandoned the radio 
watch to Rowson, suited up and 
joined Hargedon at the remain- 
ing one. They climbed in, and 
Hargedon set it in motion. 

At about the same time, the 
first tractor came into view again, 
now traveling north on the farther 
side of the chasm. Hargedon took 
this as evidence that the route 



thus far was unchanged, and 
kicked in highest speed. 

The cabin was pretty cramped, 
even though some of the equip- 
ment had been attached outside. 
The men could not expect much 
comfort for the next week. 

Hargedon was used to the trips, 
however. He disapproved on prin- 
ciple _of people who complained 
about minor inconveniences such 
as having to sleep in spacesuits; 
fortunately, Zaino’s interest and 
excitement overrode any thought 
he might have had about discom- 
fort. 

This lasted through the time 
they spent doubling the vast crack 
in Mercury’s crust, driving on a 
little to the north of the ship on 
the other side and then turning 
west toward the dark hemisphere. 
The route was identical to that 
of Harmon’s machine for some 
time, though no trace of its pas- 
sage showed on the hard surface. 
Then Hargedon angled off toward 
the southwest. He had driven 
this run often enough to know it 
well even without the markers 
which had been set out with the 
seismographs. The photographic 
maps were also aboard. With 
them, even Zaino had no trouble 
keeping track of their progress 
while they remained in sunlight. 

However, the sun sank as they 
traveled west. In two hours its 
lower rim would have been on the 
horizon, had they been able to 



14 



GALAXY 



see the horizon; as it was, more 
of the “sea level” lava plain was 
in shadow than not even near 
the ship, and their route now lay 
in semi-darkness. 

The light came from peaks 
projecting into the sunlight, from 
scattered sky-light which was 
growing rapidly fainter and from 
the brighter celestial objects such 
as Earth. Even with the tractor’s 
lights it was getting harder to spot 
crevasses and seismometer mark- 
ers. Zaino quickly found the fun 
wearing off . though his pride 
made him cover this fact as best 
he could. 

If Hargedon saw this, he said 
nothing. He set Zaino to picking 
up every other instrument, as 
any partner would have, making 
no allowance for the work the 
youngster was doing for Schloss- 
berg. This might, of course, have 
had the purpose of keeping the 
radioman too busy to think about 
discomfort. Or it might merely 
have been Hargedon’s idea of 
normal procedure. 

Whatever the cause, Zaino got 
little chance to use the radio once 
they had driven into the darkness. 
He managed only one or two brief 
talks with those left at the ship. 

^^HE TALKS might have 
helped his morale, since they 
certainly must have given the 
impression that nothing was go- 
ing on in the ship while at least 



he had something to do in the 
tractor. However, this state of 
affairs did not last. Before the ve- 
hicle was four hours out of sight 
of the Albireo, a broadcast by 
Camille Burkett reached them. 

The mineralogist’s voice con- 
tained at least as much profes- 
sional enthusiasm as alarm, but 
everyone listening must have 
thought promptly of the dubious 
stability of Mercury’s crust. The 
call was intended for her fellow 
geologists Mardikian and Har- 
mon. But it interested Zaino at 
least as much. 

“Joe! Eileen! There’s a column 
of what looks like black smoke 
rising over Northeast Spur. It 
can’t be a real fire, of course; I 
can’t see its point of origin, but 
if it’s the convection current it 
seems to be the source must be 
pretty hot. It’s the closest thing 
to a genuine volcano I’ve seen 
since we arrived; it’s certainly not 
another of those ash mounds. I 
should think you’d still be close 
enough to make it out, Joe. Can 
you see anything?” 

The reply from Mardikian’s 
tractor was inaudible to Zaino 
and Hargedon, but Burkett’s an- 
swer made its general tenor plain. 

“I hadn’t thought of that. Yes, 
I’d say it was pretty close to the 
Brightside route. It wouldn’t be 
practical for you to stop your run 
now to come back to see. You 
couldn’t do much about it any-

way. I could go out to have a 
look and then report to you. If 
the way back is blocked there’ll 
be plenty of time to work out 
another.” Hargedon and Zaino 
passed questioning glances at each 
other during the shorter pause 
that followed. 

“I know there aren’t,” the voice 
then went on, responding to the 
words they could not hear, “but 
it’s only two or three miles, I’d 
say. Two to the spur and not 
much farther to where I could see 
the other side. Enough of the way 
is in shade so I could make it in 
a suit easily enough. I can’t see 
calling back either of the dark- 
side tractors. Their work is just 
as important as the rest — any- 
way, Eileen is probably out of 
range. She hasn’t answered yet.” 

Another pause. 

“That’s true. Still, it would 
mean sacrificing that set of seis- 
mic records — no, wait. We could^ 
go out later for those. And Mel 
could take his own weather meas- 
ures on the later trip. There’s 
plenty of time!” 

Pause, longer this time. 

“You’re right, of course. I just 
wanted to get an early look at 
this volcano, if it is one. We’ll let 
the others finish their runs, and 
when you get back you can check 
the thing from the other side 
yourself. If it is blocking your 
way there’s time to find an alter- 
nate route. We could be doing 



that from the maps in the mean- 
time, just in case.” 

Zaino looked again at his com- 
panion. 

“Isn’t that just my luck!” he 
exclaimed. “I jump at the first 
chance to get away from being 
bored to death. The minute I’m 
safely away, the only interesting 
thing of the whole operation hap- 
pens — back at the ship!” 

“Who asked to come on this 
trip?” 

“Oh, I’m not blaming anyone 
but myself. If I’d stayed back 
there the volcano would have 
popped out here somewhere, or 
else waited until we were gone.” 
“If it is a volcano. Dr. Burkett 
didn’t seem quite sure.” 

“No, and I’ll bet a nickel she’s 
suiting up right now to go out 
and see. I hope she comes back 
with something while we’re still 
near enough to hear about it.” 
Hargedon shrugged. “I suppose 
it was also just your luck that 
sent you on a Darkside trip? You 
know the radio stuff. You knew 
we couldn’t reach as far this way 
with the radios. Didn’t you think 
of that in advance?” 

“I didn’t think of it, any more 
than you would have. It was bad 
luck, but I’m not grousing about 
it. Let’s get on with this job.” 
Hargedon nodded with approval, 
and possibly with some surprise, 
and the tractor hummed on its 
way. 



16 



GALAXY 



The darkness deepened around 
the patches of lava shown by the 
driving lights; the sky darkened 
toward a midnight hue, with stars 
showing ever brighter through it; 
and radio reception from the AI- 
bireo began to get spotty. Gas 
density at the ion layer was high 
enough so that recombination of 
molecules with their radiation- 
freed electrons was rapid. Only 
occasional streamers of ionized 
gas reached far over Darkside. 
As these thinned out, so did radio 
reception. Camille Burkett’s next 
broadcast came through very 
poorly. 

There was enough in it, how- 
ever, to seize the attention of the 
two men in the tractor. 

^HE WAS saying; real all 
^ right, and dangerous. It’s the 
. thing I ever saw . kinds 
of lava from what looks like . 
same vent. There’s high viscosity 
stuff building a spatter cone to 
end all spatter cones, and some 
very thin fluid from somewhere 
at the bottom. The flow has al- 
ready blocked the valley used by 
the Brightside routes and is com- 
ing along it. A new return route 
will have to be found for the 
tractors that . was spreading 
fast when I saw it. I can’t tell how 
much will come. But unless it 
stops there’s nothing at all to 
keep the flow away from the ship. 
It isn’t coming fast, but it’s com- 



ing. I’d advise all tractors to turn 
back. Captain Rowson reminds 
me that only one takeoff is pos- 
sible. If we leave this site, we’re 
committed to leaving Mercury. 
Arnie and Ren, do you hear me?” 

Zaino responded at once. “We 
got most of it. Doctor. Do you 
really think the ship is in dan- 
ger?” 

“I don’t know. I can only say 
that if this flow continues the 
ship will have to leave, because 
this area will sooner or later be 
covered. I caii’t guess how likely 
. check further to get some 
sort of estimate. It’s different from 
any Earthly lava source — may- 
be you heard — should try to get 
Eileen and Eric back, too. I can’t 
raise them. I suppose they’re well 
out from under the ion layer by 
now. Maybe you’re close enough 
to them to catch them with dif- 
fracted waves. Try, anyway. 
Whether you can raise them or 
not you’d better start back your- 
self.” 

Hargedon cut in at this point. 
“What does Dr. Mardikian say 
about that? We still have most 
of the seismometers on this route 
to visit.” 

“I think Captain Rowson has 
the deciding word here, but if it 
helps your decision Dr. Mardikian 
has already started back. He 
hasn’t finished his route, either. 
So hop back here, Ren. And 
Arnie, put that technical skill you 



HOT PLANET 



17 




haven’t had to use yet to work 
raising Eileen and Eric.” 

“What I can do, I will,” replied 
Zaino, “but you’d better tape a 
recall message and keep it going 
out on. Let’s see — band F.” 
“All right. I’ll be ready to check 
the volcano as soon as you get 
back. How long?” 

“Seven hours — maybe six and 
a half,” replied Hargedon. “We 
have to be careful.” 

“Very well. Stay outside when 
you arrive; I’ll want to go right 
out in the tractor to get a closer 
look.” She cut off. 

“And that came through clearly 
enough!” remarked Hargedon as 
he swung the tractor around. 
“I’ve been awake for fourteen 



hours, driving off and on for ten 
of them; I’m about to drive for 
another six; and then I’m to stand 
by for more.” 

“Would you like me to do some 
of the driving?” asked Zaino. 

“I guess you’ll have to, whether 
I like it or not,” was the rather 
lukewarm reply. “I’ll keep on for 
awhile, though — until we’re 
back in better light. You get at 
your radio job.” 

Ill 

yAINO TRIED. Hour after 
^ hour he juggled from one 
band to another. Once he had 
Hargedon stop while he went out 
to attach a makeshift antenna 



18 



GALAXY 




which, he hoped, would change 
his output from broadcast to some 
sort of beam; after this he kept 
probing the sky with the “beam,” 
first listening to the Albireo’s 
broadcast in an effort to find pro- 
jecting wisps of ionosphere and 
then, whenever he thought he had 
one, switching on his transmitter 
and driving his own message at 
it. 

Not once did he complain 
about lack of equipment or re- 
mark how much better he could 
do once he was back at the ship. 

Hargedon’s silence began to 
carry an undercurrent of approval 
not usual in people who spent 
much time with Zaino. The tech- 
nician made no further reference 



to the suggestion of switching 
drivers. They came in sight of 
the Albireo and doubled the 
chasm with Hargedon still at the 
wheel, Zaino still at his radio 
and both of them still uncertain 
whether any of the calls had got- 
ten through. 

Both had to admit, even before 
they could see the ship, that 
Burkett had had a right to be 
impressed. 

The smoke column showed 
starkly against the sky, blowing 
back over the tractor and block- 
ing the sunlight which would 
otherwise have glared into the 
driver’s eyes. Fine particles fell 
from it in a steady shower; look- 
ing back, the men could see tracks 



HOT PLANET 



19 



left by their vehicle in the de- 
posit which had already fallen. 

As they approached the ship 
the dark pillar grew denser and 
narrower, while the particles rain- 
ing from it became coarser. In 
some places the ash was drifting 
into fairly deep piles, giving 
Hargedon some anxiety about 
possible concealed cracks. The 
last part of the trip, along the 
edge of the great chasm and 
around its end, was really dan- 
gerous; cracks running from its 
sides were definitely spreading. 
The two men reached the Albireo 
later than Hargedon had prom- 
ised, and found Burkett waiting 
impatiently with a pile of appara- 
tus beside her. 

She didn’t wait for them to get 
out before starting to organize. 

“There isn’t much here. We’ll 
take off just enough of what 
you’re carrying to make room for 
this. No — wait. I’ll have to check 
some of your equipment; I’rh go- 
ing to need one of Milt Schloss- 
berg’s gadget’s, I think, so leave 
that on. We’ll take — ” 

“Excuse me, Doctor,” cut in 
Hargedon. “Our suits need serv- 
icing, or at least mine will if you 
want me to drive you. Perhaps 
Arnie can help you load for a 
while, if you don’t think it’s too 
important for him to get at the 
radio — ” 

“Of course. Excuse me. I should 
have had someone out here to 



help me with this. You two go 
on in. Ren, please get back as 
soon as you can. I can do the 
work here; none of this stuff is 
very heavy.” 

Zaino hesitated as he swung 
out of the cab. True, there wasn’t 
too much to be moved, and it 
wasn’t very heavy in Mercury’s 
gravity, and he really should be 
at the radio; but the thirty-nine- 
year-old mineralogist was a 
middle-aged lady by his stand- 
ards, and shouldn’t be allowed to 
carry heavy packages . 

“Get along, Arnie!” the middle- 
aged lady interrupted this train 
of thought. “Eric and Eileen are 
getting farther away and harder 
to reach every second you daw- 
dle!” 

¥TE GOT, though he couldn’t 
help looking northeast as he 
went rather than where he was 
going. 

The towering menace in that 
direction would have claimed 
anyone’s attention. The pillar of 
sable ash was rising straighter, 
as though the wind were having 
less effect on it. An equally black 
cone had risen into sight beyond 
Northeast Spur — a cone that 
must have grown to some two 
thousand feet in roughly ten 
hours. It had far steeper sides 
than the cinder mounds near it; 
it couldn’t be made of the same 
loose ash. Perhaps it consisted of 



20 



GALAXY 



half-melted particles which were 
fusing together as they fell — that 
might be what Burkett had meant 
by “spatter-cone.” Still, if that 
were the case, the material foun- 
taining from the cone’s top should 
be lighting the plain with its in- 
candescence rather than casting 
an inky shadow for its entire 

height. 

Well, that was a problem for the 
geologists; Zaino climbed aboard 
and settled to his task. 

The trouble was that he could 
do very little more here than he 
could in the tractor. He could 
have improvised longer-wave 
transmitting coils whose radia- 
tions would have diffracted a lit- 
tle more effectively beyond the 
horizon, but the receiver on the 
missing vehicle would not have 
detected them. He had more 
power at his disposal, but could 
only beam it into empty space 
with his better antennae. He had 
better equipment for locating any 
projecting wisps of charged gaS 
which might reflect his waves, 
but he was already located under 
a solid roof of the stuff — the 
Albireo was technically on 
Brightside. Bouncing his beam 
from this layer still didn’t give 
him the range he needed, as he 
had found both by calculation 
and trial. 

What he really needed was a 
relay satellite. The target was 
simply too far around Mercury’s 



sharp curve by now for anything 
less. 

Zaino’s final gesture was to set 
his transmission beam on the 
lowest frequency the tractor 
would pick up, aim it as close to 
the vehicle’s direction as he could 
calculate from map and itinerary 
and set the recorded return mes- 
sage going. He told Rowson as 
much. 

“Can’t think of ansdhing else?” 
the captain asked. “Well, neither 
can I, but of course it’s not my 
field. I’d give a year’s pay if I 
could. How long before they 
should be back in range?” 

“About four days. A hundred 
hours, give or take a few. They’ll 
be heading back anyway by that 
time.” 

“Of course. Well, keep trying.” 

“I am — or rather, the equip- 
ment is. I don’t see what else I 
can do unless a really bright idea 
should suddenly sprout. Is there 
anywhere else I could be useful? 
I’m as likely to have ideas work- 
ing as just sitting.” 

“We can keep you busy, all 
right. But how about taking a 
transmitter up one of those moun- 
tains? That would get your wave 
farther.” 

“Not as far as it’s going al- 
ready. I’m bouncing it off the ion 
layer, which is higher than any 
mountain we’ve seen on Mercury 
even if it’s nowhere near as high 
as Earth’s.” 



HOT PLANET 



21 



“Hmph. All right.” 

“I could help Ren and Dr. 
Burkett. I could hang on outside 
the tractor — ” 

“They’ve already gone. You’d 
better call them, though, and keep 
a log of what they do.” 

“All right.” Zaino turned back 
to his board and with no trouble 
raised the tractor carrying Harge- 
don and the mineralogist. The 
latter had been trying to call the 
Albireo and had some acid com- 
ments about radio operators who 
slept on the job. 

I ■'HERE’S ONLY one of me, 
and I’ve been trying to get 
the Darkside team,” he pointed 
out. “Have you found anything 
new about this lava flood?” 
“Flow, not flood,” corrected the 
professional automatically. “We’re 
not in sight of it yet. We’ve just 
rounded the corner that takes us 
out of your sight. It’s over a mile 
yet, and a couple of more corners, 
before we get to the spot where 
I left it. Of course, it will be 
closer than that by now. It was 
spreading at perhaps a hundred 
yards an hour then. That’s one 
figure we must refine ... Of 
course. I’ll try to get samples, too. 
I wish there were some way to 
get samples of the central cone. 
The whole thing is the queerest 
volcano I’ve ever heard of. Have 
you gotten Eileen started back?” 
“Not as far as I can tell. As 



with your cone samples, there are 
practical difficulties,” replied Zai- 
no. “I haven’t quit yet, though.” 
“I should think not. If some of 
us were paid by the idea we’d 
be pretty poor, but the perspira- 
tion part of genius is open to all 
of us.” 

“You mean I should charge a 
bonus for getting this call 
through?” retorted the operator. 

Whatever Burkett’s reply to 
this might have been was never 
learned; her attention was di- 
verted at that point. 

“We’ve just come in sight of 
the flow. It’s about five hundred 
yards ahead. We’ll get as close 
as seems safe, and I’ll try to make 
sure whether it’s really lava or 
just mud.” 

“Mud? Is that possible? I 
thought there wasn’t — couldn’t 
be — any water on this planet!” 
“It is, and there probably isn’t. 
The liquid phase of mud doesn’t 
have to be water, even though it 
usually is on Earth. Here, for 
example, it might conceivably be 
sulfur.” 

“But if it’s just mud, it wouldn’t 
hurt the ship, would it?” 
“Probably not.” 

“Then why all this fuss about 
getting the tractors back in a 
hurry?” 

•'■''HE 'VOICE which answered 
reminded him of another lady 
in his past, who had kept him 



22 



GALAXY 



after school for drawing pictures 
in math class. 

“Because in my judgment the 
flow is far more likely to be lava 
than mud, and if I must be wrong 
I’d rather my error were one that 
left us alive. I have no time at 
the moment to explain the basis 
of my judgment. I will be report- 
ing our activities quite steadily 
from now on, and would prefer 
that you not interrupt unless a 
serious emergency demands it, 
or you get a call from Eileen. 

“We are about three hundred 
yards away now. The front is 
moving about as fast as before, 
which suggests that the flow is 
coming only along this valley. 
It’s only three or four feet high, 
so viscosity is very low or density 
very high. Probably the former, 
considering where we are. It’s as 
black as the smoke column.” 

“Not glowing?” cut in Zaino , 
thoughtlessly. 

“Black, I said. Temperature 
will be easier to measure when 
we get closer. The front is nearly 
straight across the valley, with 
just a few lobes projecting ten 
or twelve yards and one notch 
where a small spine is being sur- 
rounded. By the way, I trust 
you’re taping all this?” Again 
Zaino was reminded of the after- 
noon after school. 

“Yes, Ma’am,” he replied. “On 
my one and only monitor tape.” 

“Very well. We’re stopping 



near the middle of the valley one 
hundreds yards from the front. I 
am getting out, and will walk as 
close as I can with a sampler and 
a radiometer. I assume that the 
radio equipment will continue to 
relay my suit broadcast back to 
you.” Zaino cringed a little, cer- 
tain as he was that the tractor’s 
electronic apparatus was in per- 
fect order. 

It struck him that Dr. Burkett 
was being more snappish than 
usual. It never crossed his mind 
that the wornan might be afraid. 

“Ren, don’t get any closer with 
the tractor unless I call. I’ll get 
a set of temperature readings as 
soon as I’m close enough. Then 
I’ll try to get a sample. Then I’ll 
come back with that to the trac- 
tor, leave it and the radiometer 
and get the markers to set out.” 

“Couldn’t I be putting out the 
markers while you get the sam- 
ple, Doctor?” 

“You could, but I’d rather you 
stayed at the wheel.” Hargedon 
made no answer, and Burkett re- 
sumed her description for the 
record. 

“I’m walking toward the front, 
a good deal faster than it’s flow- 
ing toward me. I am now about 
twenty yards away, and am going 
to take a set of radiation-tempera- 
ture measures.” A brief pause. 
“Readings coming. Nine sixty. 
Nine eighty. Nine ninety — that’s 
from the bottom edge near the 



HOT PLANET 



23 



spine that’s being surrounded. 
Nine eighty-five — ” The voice 
droned on until about two dozen 
readings had been taped. Then, 
“I’m going closer now. The sam- 
pler is just a ladle on a twelve- 
foot handle we improvised, so 
I’ll have to get that close. The 
stuff is moving slowly; there 
should be no trouble. I’m in reach 
now. The lava is very liquid; 
there’s no trouble getting the sam- 
pler in — or out again — it’s not 
very dense, either. I’m heading 
back toward the tractor now. No, 
Ren, dop’t come to meet me.” 
There was a minute of silence, 
while Zaino pictured the space- 
suited figure with its awkwardly 
Idng burden, walking away from 
the creeping menace to the rela- 
tive safety of the tractor. “It’s 
frozen solid already; we needn’t 
worry about spilling. The tem- 
perature is about — five eighty. 
Give me the markers, please.” 
Another pause, shorter this 
time. Zaino wondered how much 
of that could be laid to a faster 
walk without the ladle and how 
much to the lessening distance 
between flow and tractor. “I’m 
tossing the first marker close to 
the edge — it’s landed less than 
a foot from the lava. They’re all 
on a light cord at ten-foot inter- 
vals; I’m paying out the cord as 
I go back to the tractor. Now we’ll 
stand by and time the arrival at 
each marker as well as we can.” 



“How close are you to the i 
main cone?” asked Zaino. f 

“Not close enough to see its ) 
base, I’m afraid. Or to get a sam- i 
pie of it, which is worse. We — | 
goodness, what was that?” j 

Zaino had just time to ask, J 
“What was what?” when he found j 
nut. 



rOR A moment, he thought that 
the Albireo had been flung j 
bodily into the air. Then he de- 
cided that the great metal pillar ; 
had merely fallen over. Finally i 
he realized that the ship was still j 
erect, but the ground under it had 1 
just tried to leave. 

Everyone in the group had be- f 
come so used to the almost perpe- ! 
tual ground tremors that they had j 
ceased to notice them; but this } 
one demanded attention. Rowson, J 
using language which suggested ' 
that his career might not have \ 
been completely free of adven- 
ture after all, flashed through the 
communication level on his way 
down to the power section. 
Schlossberg and Babineau fol- 
lowed, the medic pausing to ask 
Zaino if he were all right. The 
radioman merely nodded affirma- 
tively; his attention was already 
back at his job. Burkett was 
speaking a good deal faster than 
before. 

“Never mind if the sample isn’t 



lashed tight yet — if it falls off 
there’ll be plenty more. There 
isn’t time! Arnie, get in touch 
with Dr. Mardikian and Dr. 
Marini. Tell them that this vol- 
cano is explosive, that all esti- 
mates of what the flow may do 
are off until we can make more 
measures, and in any case the 
whole situation is unpredictable. 
Everyone should get back as soon 
as possible. Remember, we de- 
cided that those big craters Eileen 
checked were not meteor pits. I 
don’t know whether this thing 
will let go in the next hour, the 
next year, or at all. Maybe what’s 
happening now will act as a safety 
valve — but let’s get out. Ren, 
that flow is speeding up and get- 
ting higher, and the ash rain is 
getting a lot worse. Can you see 
to drive?” 

She fell silent. Zaino, in spite 
of her orders, left his set long 
enough to leap to the nearest port 
for a look at the volcano. 

He never regretted it. 

Across the riven plain, whose 
cracks were now nearly hidden 
under the new ash, the black cone 
towered above the nearer eleva- 
tions. It was visibly taller than 
it had been only a few hours be- 
fore. The fountain from its top 
was thicker, now jetting straight 
up as though wind no longer 
meant a thing to the fiercely 
driven column of gas and dust. 
The darkness was not so complete; 



patches of red and yellow incan- 
descence showed briefly in the 
pillar, and glowing sparks rather 
than black cinders rained back 
on the steep slopes. Far above, 
a ring of smoke rolled and 
spread about the column, form- 
ing an ever-broadening blanket 
of opaque cloud above a land- 
scape which had never before 
been shaded from the sun. 
Streamers of lightning leaped be- 
tween cloud and pillar, pillar and 
mountain, even cloud and ground. 
Any thunder there might have 
been was drowned in the howl 
of the escaping gas, a roar which 
seemed to combine every possible 
note from the shrillest possible 
whistle to a bass felt by the chest 
rather than heard by the ears. 
Rowson’s language had become 
inaudible almost before he had 
disappeared down the hatch. 

For long moments the radio- 
man watched the spreading cloud, 
and wondered whether the Al- 
bireo could escape being struck 
by the flickering, ceaseless light- 
ning. Far above the widening ring 
of cloud the smoke fountain 
drove, spreading slowly in the 
thinning atmosphere and beyond 
it. Zaino had had enough space 
experience to tell at a glance 
whether a smoke or dust cloud 
was in air or not. This wasn’t, at 
least at the upper extremity . 

And then, quite calmly, he 
turned back to his desk, aimed 



24 



GALAXY 



HOT PLANET 



25 



the antenna straight up, and 
called Eileen Harmon. She an- 
swered promptly. 

fpRE STRATIGRAPHER lis- 
tened without interruption to 
his report and the order to return. 
She conferred briefly with her 
companion, replied “We’ll be back 
in twelve hours,” and signed off. 
And that was that. 

Zaino settled back with a sign, 
and wondered whether it would 
be tactful to remind Rowson of 
his offer of a year’s pay. 

All four vehicles were now 
homeward bound; all one had to 
worry about was whether any of 
them would make it. Hargedon 
and Burkett were fighting their 
way through an ever-increasing 
ash rain a scant two miles away — 
ash which not only cut visibility 
but threatened to block the way 
with drifts too deep to negotiate. 
The wind, now blowing fiercely 
toward the volcano, blasted the 
gritty stuff against their front 
window as though it would erode 
through; and the lava flow, mov- 
ing far faster than the gentle ooze 
they had never quite measured, 
surged — and glowed — grimly 
behind. 

A hundred miles or more to 
the east, the tractors containing 
Mardikian, Marini and their driv- 
ers headed southwest along the 
alternate route their maps had 
suggested; but Mardikian, some 



three hours in the lead, reported 
that he could see four other smoke 
columns in that general direction. 

Mercury seemed to be enter- 
ing a new phase. The maps might 
well be out of date. 

Harmon and Trackman were 
having no trouble at the moment, 
but they would have to pass the 
great chasm. This had been shoot- 
ing out daughter cracks when 
Zaino and Hargedon passed it 
hours before. No one could say 
what it might be like now, and 
no one was going out to make 
sure. 

“We can see you!” Burkett’s 
voice came through suddenly. 
“Half a mile to go, and we’re way 
ahead of the flow.” 

“But it’s coming?” Rowson 
asked tensely. He had returned 
from the power level at Zaino’s 
phoned report of success. 

“It’s coming.” 

“How fast? When will it get 
here? Do you know whether the 
ship can stand contact with it?” 

“I don’t know the speed exactly. 
There may be two hours, maybe 
five or six. The ship can’t take it. 
Even the temperature measures 
I got were above the, softening 
point of the alloys, and it’s hotter 
and much deeper now. Anyway, 
if the others aren’t back before 
the flow reaches the ship they 
won’t get through. The tractor 
wheels would char away, and I 
doubt that the bodies would float. 



26 



GALAXY 




You certainly can’t wade through 
the stuff in a spacesuit, either.” 
“And you think there can’t be 
more than five or six hours before 
the flow arrives?” 

“I’d say that was a very opti- 
mistic guess. I’ll stop and get a 
better speed estimate if you want, 
but won’t swear to it.” 

Rowson thought for a moment. 
“No,” he said finally, “don’t 
bother. Get back here as soon as 
you can. We need the tractor and 
human muscles more than we 
need even expert guesses.” He 
turned to the operator. 

“Zaino, tell all the tractors 
there’ll be no answer from the 
ship for a while, because no one 
will be aboard. Then suit up and 
come outside.” He was gone. 

rpEN MINUTES later, six hu- 
man beings and a tractor were 
assembled in the flame-lit near- 
darkness outside the ship. The 
cloud had spread to the horizon, 
and the sun was gone. Burkett 
and Hargedon had arrived, but 
Rowson wasted no time on con- 
gratulations. 

“We have work to do. It will 
be easy enough to keep the lava 
from the ship, since there seems 
to be a foot or more of ash on the 
ground and a touch of main drive 
would push it into a ringwall 
around us; but that’s not the main 
problem. We have to keep it 
from reaching the chasm any- 



where south of us, since that’s the 
way the others will be coming. 
If they’re cut off, they’re dead. It 
will be brute work. We’ll use the 
tractor any way we can think of. 
Unfortunately it has no plow at- 
tachment, and I can’t think of 
anything aboard which could be 
turned into one. You have shov- 
els, such as they are. The ash is 
light, especially here, but there’s 
a mile and a half of dam to be 
built. I don’t see how it can pos- 
sibly be done . but it’s going 
to be.” 

“Come on, Arnie! You’re young 
and strong,” came the voice of 
the mineralogist. “You should be 
able to lift as much of this stuff 
as I can. I understand you were 
lucky enough to get hold of Eileen 
— have you asked for the bonus 
yet? — but your work isn’t done.” 

“It wasn’t luck,” Zaino retorted. 
Burkett, in spite of her voice, 
seened much less of a schoolmis- 
tress when encased in a spacesuit 
and carrying a shovel, so he was 
able to talk back to her. “I was 
simply alert enough to make use 
of existing conditions, which I 
had to observe for myself in spite 
of all the scientists around. I’m 
charging the achievement to my 
regular salary. I saw — ” 

He stopped suddenly, both with 
with tongue and shovel. Then, 
“Captain!” 

“What is it?” 

“The only reason we’re starting 



28 



GALAXY 



this wall here is to keep well 
ahead of the flow so we can work 
as long as possible, isn’t it?” 

“Yes, I suppose so. I never 
thought of trying anywhere else. 
The valley would mean a much 
shorter dam, but if the flow isn’t 
through it by now it would be 
before we could get there — oh! 
Wait a minute!” 

“Yes, sir. You can put the main 
switch anywhere in a D. C. cir- 
cuit. Where are the seismology 
stores we never had to use?” 

Four minutes later the tractor 
set out from the Alhireo, carrying 
Rowson and Zaino. Six minutes 
after that it stopped at the base 
of the ash cone which formed the 
north side of the valley from 
which the lava was coming. They 
parked a quarter of the way 
around the cone’s base from the 
emerging flood and started to 
climb on foot, both carrying bur- 
dens. 

Forty-seven minutes later they 
returned empty-handed to the ve- 
hicle, to find that it had been 
engulfed by the spreading liquid. 

With noticeable haste they 
floundered through the loose ash 
a few yards above the base until 
they had outdistanced the glow- 
ing menace, descended and 
started back across the plain to 
where they knew the ship to be, 
though she was invisible through 
the falling detritus. Once they had 
to detour around a crack. Once 



they encountered one which wid- 
ened toward the chasm on their 
right, and they knew a detour 
would be impossible. Leaping it 
seemed impossible, too, but they 
did it. Thirty seconds after this, 
forty minutes after finding the 
tractor destroyed, the landscape 
was bathed in a magnesium-white 
glare as the two one-and-a-half 
kiloton charges planted just in- 
side the crater rim let go. 

CiCHOULD WE go back and 

^ see if it worked?” asked 
Zaino. 

“What’s the use? The only other 
charges we had were in the trac- 
tor. Thank goodness they were 
nuclear instead of H. E. If it 
didn’t work we’d have more trou- 
ble to get back than we’re having 
now.” 

“If it didn’t work, is there any 
point in going back?” 

“Stop quibbling and keep walk- 
ing. Dr. Burkett, are you listen- 
ing?” 

“Yes, Captain.” 

“We’re fresh out of tractors, 
but if you want to try it on foot 
you might start a set of flow meas- 
ures on the lava. Arnie wants to 
know whether our landslide slid 
properly.” 

However, the two were able to 
tell for themselves before getting 
back to the Albireo. 

The flow didn’t stop all at 
once, of course; but with the val- 



HOT PLANET

ley feeding it blocked off by a 
pile of volcanic ash fotir hundred 
feet high on one side, nearly fifty 
on the other and more than a 
quarter of a mile long, its enthusi- 
asm quickly subsided. It was thin, 
fluid stuff, as Burkett had noted; 
but as it spread it cooled, and as 
it cooled it thickened. 

Six hours after the blast it had 
stopped with its nearest lobe al- 
most a mile from the ship, less 
than two feet thick at the edge. 

When Mardikian’s tractor ar- 
rived, Burkett was happily trying 
to analyze samples of the flow, 
and less happily sjjeculating on 
how long it would be before the 
entire area would be blown off 
the planet. When Marini’s and 
Harmon’s vehicles arrived, almost 
together, the specimens had been 
loaded and everything stowed for 
acceleration. Sixty seconds after 
the last person was aboard, the 
Albireo left Mercury’s surface at 
two gravities. 

The haste, it turned out, wasn’t 
really necessary. She had been 
in parking orbit nearly forty-five 
hours before the first of the giant 
volcanoes reached its climax, and 
the one beside their former site 
was not the first. It was the fourth. 

“And that seems to be that,’’ 
said Camille Burkett rather tritely 
as they drifted a hundred miles 
above the little world’s surface. 



“Just a belt of white-hot calderas 
all around the planet. Pretty, if 
you like symmetry.” 

“I like being able to see it from 
this distance,” replied Zaino, float- 
ing weightless beside her. “By 
the way, how much bonus should 
I ask for getting that idea of put- 
ting the seismic charges to use 
after all?” 

“I wouldn’t mention it. Any 
one of us might have thought of 
that. We all knew about them.” 
“Anyone might have. Let’s 
speculate on how long it would 
have been before anyone did.” 
“It’s still not like the other 
idea, which involved your own 
specialty. I still don’t see what 
made you suppose that the gas 
pillar from the volcano would be 
heavily charged enough to reflect 
your radio beam. How did that 
idea strike you?” 

^AINO THOUGHT back, and 
^ smiled a little as the picture 
of lightning blazing around pillar, 
cloud and mountain rose before 
his eyes. 

“You’re not quite right,” he 
said. “I was worried about it for 
a while, but it didn’t actually 
strike me.” 

It fell rather flat; Camille Bur- 
kett, Ph.D., had to have it ex- 
plained to her.

It has happened a hundred times in the long history 
of Barth — and, sooner or iater, will happen again! 



THE GREAT 
NEBRASKA SEA 



■r^VERYONE — all the geolo- 
gists, at any rate — had 
known about the Kiowa Fault for 
years. That was before there was 
anything very interesting to know 
about it. The first survey of Colo- 
rado traced its course north and 
south in the narrow valley of 
Kiowa Creek about twenty miles 
east of Denver; it extended south 
to the Arkansas River. And that 

By ALLAN DANZIG 



was about all even the profes- 
sionals were interested in know- 
ing. There was never so much as 
a landslide to bring the Fault to 
the attention of the general pub- 
lic. 

It was still a matter of aca- 
demic interest when in the late 
’40s geologists speculated on the 
relationship between the Kiowa 
Fault and the Conchas Fault far- 

illustrated by WOOD 



THE GREAT NEBRASKA SEA

ther south, in New Mexico, and 
which followed the Pecos as far 
south as Texas. 

Nor was there much in the 
papers a few years later when it 
was suggested that the Niobrara 
Fault (just inside and roughly 
parallel to the eastern border of 
Wyoming) was a northerly ex- 
tension of the Kiowa. By the 
mid sixties it was definitely es- 
tablished that the three Faults 
were in fact a single line of fis- 
sure in the essential rock, stretch- 
ing almost from the Canadian 
border well south of the New 
Mexico-Texas line. 

It is not really surprising that 
it took so long to figure out the 
connection. The population of 
the states affected was in places 
as low as five people per square 
mile! The land was so dry it 
seemed impossible that it could 
ever be used except for sheep- 
farming. 

It strikes us today as ironic 
that from the late ’50s there was 
grave concern about the level of 
the watertable throughout the 
entire area. 

EVEN more ironic solu- 
tion to the problem began 
in the summer of 1973. It had 
been a particularly hot and dry 
August, and the Forestry Service 
was keeping an anxious eye out 
for the fires it knew it could ex- 
pect. Dense smoke was reported 



rising above a virtually uninhab- 
ited area along Black Squirrel 
Creek, and a plane was sent out 
for a report. 

The report was — no fire at 
all. The rising cloud was not 
smoke, but dust. Thousands of 
cubic feet of dry earth rising laz- 
ily on the summer air. Rock 
slides, they guessed; certainly no 
fire. The Forestry Service had 
other worries at the moment, and 
filed the report. 

But after a week had gone by, 
the town of Edison, a good twen- 
ty miles away from the slides, 
was still complaining of the dust. 
Springs were going dry, too, ap- 
parently from underground dis- 
turbances. Not even in the Rock- 
ies could anyone remember a 
series of rock slides as bad as 
this. 

Newspapers in the mountain 
states gave it a few inches on the 
front page; anything is news in 
late August. And the geologists 
became interested. Seismologists 
were reporting unusual activity 
in the area, tremors too severe 
to be rock slides. Volcanic activ- 
ity? Specifically, a dust volcano? 
Unusual, they knew, but right on 
the Kiowa Fault — could be. 

Labor Day crowds read the 
scientific conjectures with late 
summer lassitude. Sunday sup- 
plements ran four-color artists’ 
conceptions of the possible vol- 
cano. “Only Active Volcano in 



32 



GALAXY 



U. S.?” demanded the headlines, 
and some papers even left off the 
question mark. 

It may seem odd that the sim- 
plest explanation was practically 
not mentioned. Only Joseph 
Schwartzberg, head geographer 
of the Department of the Inte- 
rior, wondered if the disturbance 
might not be a settling of the 
Kiowa Fault. His suggestion was 
mentioned on page nine or ten 
of the Monday newspapers (page 
27 of the New York Times). The 
idea was not nearly so exciting 
as a volcano, even a lava-less one, 
and you couldn’t draw a very 
dramatic picture of it. 

To excuse the other geologists, 
it must be said that the Kiowa 
Fault had never acted up before. 
It never sidestepped, never jig- 
gled, never, never produced the 
regular shows of its little sister 
out in California, which almost 
daily bounced San Francisco or 
Los Angeles, or some place in be- 
tween. The dust volcano was on 
the face of it a more plausible 
theory. 

Still, it was only a theory. It 
had to be proved. As the tremors 
grew bigger, along with the af- 
fected area, as several towns in- 
cluding Edison were shaken to 
pieces by incredible earthquakes, 
whole bus- and plane-loads of 
geologists set out for Colorado, 
without even waiting for their 
university and government de- 



partments to approve budgets. 

They found, of course, that 
Schwartzberg had been perfectly 
correct. 

rpHEY FOUND themselves on 
the scene of what was fast 
becoming the most violent and 
widespread earthquake North 
America — probably the world — 
has ever seen in historic times. 
To describe it in the simplest 
terms, land east of the Fault was 
settling, and at a precipitous rate. 

Rock scraped rock with a 
whining roar. Shuddery as a 
squeaky piece of chalk raked a- 
cross a blackboard, the noise was 
deafening. The surfaces of the 
land east and west of the Fault 
seemed no longer to have any 
relation to each other. To the 
west, tortured rock reared into 
cliffs. East, where sharp reports 
and muffled wheezes told of con- 
tinued buckling and dropping, 
the earth trembled downward. 
Atop the new cliffs, which seemed 
to grow by sudden inches from 
heaving rubble, dry earth fissured 
and trembled, sliding acres at a 
time to fall, smoking, into the 
bucking, heaving bottom of the 
depression. 

There the devastation was e- 
ven more thorough, if less spec- 
tacular. Dry earth churned like 
mud, and rock shards weighing 
tons bumped and rolled about 
like pebbles as they shivered and 



THE GREAT NEBRASKA SEA 



33 



cracked into pebbles themselves. 
“It looks like sand dancing in a 
child’s sieve,” said the normally 
impassive Schwartzberg in a na- 
tionwide broadcast from the 
scene of disaster. “No one here 
has ever seen ansrthing like it.” 
And the landslip was growing, 
north and south along the Fault. 

“Get out while you can,” 
Schwartzberg urged the popula- 
tion of the affected area. “When 
it’s over you can come back and 
pick up the pieces.” But the band 
of scientists who had rallied to 
his leadership privately wondered 
if there would be any pieces. 

The Arkansas River, at Avon- 
dale and North Avondale, was 
sluggishly backing north into the 
deepening trough. At the rate 
things were going, there might be 
a new lake the entire length of 
El Paso and Pueblo Counties. 
And, warned Schwartzberg, this 
might only be the beginning. 

By 16 September the landslip 
had crept down the Huerfano 
River past Cedarwood. Avondale, 
North Avondale and Boone had 
totally disappeared. Land west of 
the Fault was holding firm, 
though Denver had recorded sev- 
eral small tremors; everywhere 
east of the Fault, to almost twen- 
ty miles away, the now-familiar 
lurch and steady fall had already 
sent several thousand Coloradans 
scurrying for safety. 

All mountain climbing was 



prohibited on the Eastern Slope 
because of the danger of rock 
slides from minor quakes. The 
geologists went home to wait. 

There wasn’t much to wait for. 
The news got worse and worse. 
The Platte River, now, was cre- 
ating a vast mud puddle where 
the town of Orchard had been. 
Just below Masters, Colorado, 
the river leajjed 70-foot cliffs to 
add to the heaving chaos below. 
And the cliffs were higher every 
day as the land beneath them 
groaned downward in mile- 
square gulps. 

As the Fault moved north and 
south, new areas quivered into 
unwelcome life. Fields and whole 
mountainsides moved with de- 
ceptive sloth down, down. They 
danced “like sand in a sieve”; 
dry, they boiled into rubble. Tel- 
ephone lines, railroad tracks, 
roads snapped and simply disap- 
peared. Virtually all east- west 
land communication was sus- 
pended, and the President de- 
clared a national emergency. 

¥>Y 23 September the Fault 
was active well into Wyom- 
ing on the north, and rapidly ap- 
proaching the border of New 
Mexico to the south. Trinchera 
and Branson were totally evacu- 
ated, but even so the over-all 
death toll had risen above 1,000. 

Away to the east the situation 
was quiet but even more omi- 



34

nous. Tremendous fissures opened 
up perpendicular to the Fault, 
and a general subsidence of the 
land was noticeable well into 
Kansas and Nebraska. The west- 
ern borders of these states, and 
soon of the Dakotas and Okla- 
homa as well, were slowly sink- 
ing. 

On the actual scene of the dis- 
aster (or the scenes; it is impos- 
sible to speak of anything this 
size in the singular) there was a 
horrifying confusion. Prairie and 
hill cracked open under intolera- 
ble strains as the land shuddered 
downward in gasps and leaps. 
Springs burst to the surface in 
hot geysers and explosions of 
steam. 

The downtown section of 
North Platte, Nebraska, dropped 
eight feet, just like that, on the 
afternoon of 4 October. “We must 



remain calm,” declared the Gov- 
ernor of Nebraska. “We must 
sit this thing out. Be assured that 
everything possible is being 
done.” But what could be done, 
with his state dropping straight 
down at a mean rate of a foot 
a day? 

The Fault nicked off the south- 
east corner of Montana. It 
worked its way north along the 
Little Missouri. South, it ripped 
past Roswell, New Mexico, and 
tore down the Pecos toward 
Texas. All the upper reaches of 
the Missouri were standing pud- 
dles by now, and the Red River 
west of Paris, Texas, had begin 
to run backward. 

Soon the Missouri began slow- 
ly slipping away westward over 
the slowly churning land. Aban- 
doning its bed, the river spread 
uncertainly across farmland and 



THE GREAT NEBRASKA SEA

prairie, becoming a sea of mud 
beneath the sharp new cliffs 
which rose in rending line, ever 
taller as the land continued to 
sink, almost from Canada to the 
Mexican border. There were vir- 
tually no floods, in the usual 
sense. The water moved too slow- 
ly, spread itself with no real direc- 
tion or force. But the vast sheets 
of sluggish water and jelly-like 
mud formed death-traps for the 
countless refugees now streaming 
east. 

Perhaps the North Platte dis- 
aster had been more than anyone 
could take. 193 people had died 
in that one cave-in. Certainly by 7 
October it had to be officially ad- 
mitted that there was an exodus 
of epic proportion. Nearly two 
million people were on the move, 
and the U. S. was faced with a 
gigantic wave of refugees. Rails, 
roads and air-lanes were jammed 
with terrified hordes who had 
left everything behind to crowd 
eastward. 

All through October hollow- 
eyed motorists flocked into Tul- 
sa, Topeka, Omaha, Sioux Falls 
and Fargo. St. Louis was made 
distributing center for emergency 
squads which flew everywhere 
with milk for babies and dog 
food for evacuating pets. Gaso- 
line trucks boomed west to meet 
the demand for gas, but once in- 
side the “zone of terror,” as the 
newspapers now called it, they 



found their route blocked by 
eastbound cars on the wrong side 
of the road. Shops left by their 
fleeing owners were looted by 
refugees from further west; an 
American Airlines plane was 
wrecked by a mob of would-be 
passengers in Bismarck, North 
Dakota. Federal and State troops 
were called out, but moving two 
million people was not to be 
done in an orderly way. 

And still the landslip grew 
larger. The new cliffs gleamed in 
the autumn sunshine, growing 
higher as the land beneath them 
continued its inexorable descent. 

On 2 1 October, at Lubbock, 
Texas, there was a noise various- 
ly described as a hollow roar, a 
shriek and a deep musical vibra- 
tion like a church bell. It was 
simply the tortured rock of the 
substrata giving way. The second 
phase of the national disaster 
was beginning. 

NOISE traveled due east 
at better than 85 miles per 
hour. In its wake the earth to the 
north “just seemed to collapse on 
itself like a punctured balloon,” 
read one newspaper report. “Like 
a cake that’s failed,” said a Tex- 
arkana housewife who fortunate- 
ly lived a block south of Thayer 
Street, where the fissure raced 
through. There was a sigh and a 
great cloud of dust, and Okla- 
homa subsided at the astounding 



36 



GALAXY 



rate of about six feet per hour. 

At Biloxi, on the Gulf, there 
had been uneasy shufflings under 
foot all day. “Not tremors, exact- 
ly,” said the captain of a fishing 
boat which was somehow to ride 
out the coming flood, “but like as 
if the land wanted to be some- 
where else.” 

Everyone in doomed Biloxi 
would have done well to have 
been somewhere else that eve- 
ning. At approximately 8:30 p.m. 
the town shuddered, seemed to 
rise a little like the edge of a 
hall carpet caught in a draft, and 
sank. So did the entire Missis- 
sippi and Alabama coast, at about 
the same moment. The tidal wave 
which was to gouge the center 
from the U. S. marched on the 
land. 

From the north shore of Lake 
Ponchartrain to the Appalachi- 
cola River in Florida, the Gulf 
coast simply disappeared. Gulf- 
port, Biloxi, Mobile, Pensacola, 
Panama City: 200 miles of shore- 
line vanished, with over two and 
a half million people. An hour 
later a wall of water had swept 
over every town from Dothan, 
Alabama, to Bogalusa on the 
Louisiana-Mississippi border. 

“We must keep panic from our 
minds,” said the Governor of 
Alabama in a radio message 
delivered from a hastily arranged 
all-station hookup. “We of the gal- 
lant southland have faced and 



withstood invasion before.” Then, 
as ominous creakings and groan- 
ings of the earth announced the 
approach of the tidal wave, he 
flew out of Montgomery half an 
hour before the town disappeared 
forever. 

One head of the wave plunged 
north, eventually to spend itself 
in the hills south of Birmingham. 
The main sweep followed the 
lowest land. Reaching west, it 
swallowed Vicksburg and nicked 
the corner of Louisiana. The 
whole of East Carroll Parish was 
scoured from the map. 

The Mississippi River now 
ended at about Eudora, Arkansas, 
and minute by minute the ad- 
vancing flood bit away miles of 
river bed, swelling north. Chicot, 
Jennie, Lake Village, Arkansas 
City, Snow Lake, Elaine, Helena 
and Memphis felt the tremors. 
The tormented city shuddered 
through the night. The earth con- 
tinued its descent, eventually tip- 
ping 2 V 2 degrees down to the 
west. The “Memphis Tilt” is to- 
day one of the unique and charm- 
ing characteristics of the gracious 
Old Town, but during the night 
of panic Memphis residents were 
sure they were doomed. 

^OUTH and west the waters 
^ carved deeply into Arkansas 
and Oklahoma. By morning it 
was plain that all of Arkansas 
was going under. Waves ad- 



THE GREAT NEBRASKA SEA

vanced on Litlle Rock at almost 
100 miles an hour, new crests 
forming, overtopping the wave’s 
leading edge as towns, hills and 
the thirst of the soil temporarily 
broke the furious charge. 

Washington announced the of- 
ficial hope that the Ozarks would 
stop the wild gallop of the un- 
leashed Gulf, for in northwest 
Arkansas the land rose to over 
2,000 feet. But nothing could 
save Oklahoma. By noon the wa- 
ter reached clutching fingers 
around Mt. Scott and Elk Moun- 
tain, deluging Hobart and almost 
all of Greer County. 

Despite hopeful announce- 
ments that the wave was slow- 
ing, had virtually stopped after 
inundating Oklahoma City, was 
being swallowed up in the desert 
near Amarillo, the wall of water 
continued its advance. For the 
land was still sinking, and the 
floods were constantly replen- 
ished from the Gulf. Schwartz- 
berg and his geologists advised 



the utmost haste in evacuating 
the entire area between Colorado 
and Missouri, from Texas to 
North Dakota. 

Lubbock, Texas, went under. 
On a curling reflex the tidal wave 
blotted out Sweetwater and Big 
Spring. The Texas panhandle dis- 
appeared in one great swirl. 

Whirlpools opened. A great 
welter of smashed wood and hu- 
man debris was sucked under, 
vomited up and pounded to 
pieces. Gulf-water crashed on the 
cliffs of New Mexico and fell 
back on itself in foam. Would-be 
rescuers on the cliffs along what 
had been the west bank of the 
Pecos River afterwards recalled 
the hiss and scream like tearing 
silk as the water broke furiously 
on the newly exposed rock. It 
was the most terrible sound they 
had ever heard. 

“We couldn’t hear any shouts, 
of course, not that far away and 
with all the noise,” said Dan 
Weaver, Mayor of Carlsbad. “But 




we knew there were people down 
there. When the water hit the 
cliffs, it was like a collision be- 
tween two solid bodies. We 
couldn’t see for over an hour, 
because of the spray.” 

Salt spray. The ocean had 
come to New Mexico. 



T he cliffs proved to be the 
only effective barrier against 
the westward march of the water, 
which turned north, gouging out 
lumps of rock and tumbling 
down blocks of earth onto its 
own back. In places scoops of 
granite came out like ice cream. 
The present fishing town of Rock- 



port, Colorado, is built on a har- 
bor created in such a way. 

The water had found its far- 
thest westering. But still it 
poured north along the line of 
the original Fault. Irresistible 
fingers closed on Sterling, Colo- 
rado, on Sidney, Nebraska, on

sand feet below the level of the 
new sea. 

Memphis was by now a sea- 
port. The Ozarks, islands in a 
mad sea, formed precarious ha- 
vens for half-drowned humanity. 
Waves bit off a corner of Mis- 
souri, flung themselves on Wi- 
chita. Topeka, Lawrence and Bel- 
leville were the last Kansas 
towns to disappear. The Gover- 
nor of Kansas went down with 
his State. 

Daniel Bernd of Lincoln, 
Nebraska, was washed up half- 
drowned in a cove of the Wyom- 
ing cliffs, having been sucked 
from one end of vanished Neb- 
raska to the other. Similar hair- 
breadth escapes were recounted 
on radio and television. 

Virtually the only people saved 
out of the entire population of 
Pierre, South Dakota were the 
six members of the Creeth fam- 
ily. Plucky Timothy Creeth car- 
ried and dragged his aged par- 
ents to the loft of their barn on 
the outskirts of town. His brother 
Geoffrey brought along the 
younger children and what pro- 
visions they could find — “Mostly 
a ham and about half a ton of 
vanilla cookies,” he explained to 
his eventual rescuers. The barn, 
luckily collapsing in the vibra- 
tions as the waves bore down oh 
them, became an ark in which 
they rode out the disaster. 

“We must of played cards for 

40 



four days straight,” recalled gen- 
ial Mrs. Creeth when she after- 
wards appeared on a popular tel- 
evision spectacular. Her rural 
good-humor undamaged by an 
ordeal few women can ever have 
been called on to face, she add- 
ed, “We sure wondered why 
flushes never came out right. 
Jimanettly, we’d left the king of 
hearts behind, in the rush!” 

But such lightheartedness and 
such happy endings were by no 
means typical. The world could 
only watch aghast as the water ^ 
raced north under the shadow of | 
the cliffs which occasionally j 
crumbled, roaring, into the roar- . 
ing waves. Day by day the re- 
lentless rush swallowed what had 
been dusty farmland, cities and 
towns. 

Some people were saved by the 
helicopters which flew mercy mis- 
sions just ahead of the advancing 
waters. Some found safety in the 
peaks of western Nebraska and 
the Dakotas. But when the wa- 
ters came to rest along what is 
roughly the present shoreline of 
our inland sea, it was estimated 
that over fourteen million peo- 
ple had lost their lives. 

No one could even estimate the 
damage to property; almost the 
entirety of eight states, and por- ^ 
tions of twelve others, had sim- 
ply vanished from the heart of ^ 
the North American continent ' 
forever. i 

G A L A X.Y 






I T WAS in such a cataclysmic 
birth that the now-peaceful 
Nebraska Sea came to America. 

Today, nearly one hundred 
years after the unprecedented 
— and happily unrepeated — dis- 
aster, it is hard to remember the 
terror and despair of those weeks 
in October and November, 1973. 
It is inconceivable to think of the 
United States without its beauti- 
ful and economically essential 
curve of interior ocean. Two- 
thirds as long as the Mediter- 
ranean, it graduates from the 
warm waters of the Gulf of Mex- 
ico through the equally blue 
waves of the Mississippi Bight, 
becoming cooler and greener 
north and west of the pleasant 
fishing isles of the Ozark Archi- 
pelago, finally shading into the 
gray-green chop of the Gulf of 
Dakota. 

What would the United States 
have become without the 5600- 
mile coastline of our inland sea? 
It is only within the last twenty 
years that any but the topmost 
layer of water has cleared suf- 
ficiently to permit a really exten- 
sive fishing industry. Mud still 
held in suspension by the restless 
waves will not precipitate fully 
even in our lifetimes. Even so, 
the commercial fisheries of Mis- 
souri and Wyoming contribute no 
small part to the nation’s econ- 
omy. 

Who can imagine what the 



middle west must have been like 
before the amelioration of cli- 
mate brought about by the prox- 
imity of a warm sea? The now- 
temperate state of Minnesota (to 
say nothing of the submerged 
Dakotas) must have been Si- 
berian. From contemporary ac- 
counts Missouri, our second Cali- 
fornia, was unbelievably muggy, 
almost uninhabitable during the 
summer months. Our climate to- 
day, from Ohio and North Caro- 
lina to the rich fields of New 
Mexico and the orchards of Mon- 
tana, is directly ameliorated by 
the marine heart of the continent. 

Who today could imagine the 
United States without the majes- 
tic sea-cliffs in stately parade 
from New Mexico to Montana? 
The beaches of Wyoming, the 
American Riviera, where fruit 
trees grow almost to the water’s 
edge? Or incredible Colorado, 
where the morning skier is the 
afternoon bather, thanks to the 
monorail connecting the highest 
peaks with the glistening white 
beaches? 

Of course there have been 
losses to balance slightly these 
strong gains. The Mississippi was, 
before 1973, one of the great 
rivers of the world. Taken to- 
gether with its main tributary, 
the Missouri, it vied favorably 
with such giant systems as the 
Amazon and the Ganges. Now, 
ending as it does at Memphis 



THE GREAT NEBRASKA SEA 



41 




and drawing its water chiefly 
from the Appalachian Mountains, 
it is only a slight remnant of 
what it was. And though the Neb- 
raska Sea today carries many 
times the tonnage of shipping in 
its ceaseless traffic, we have lost 
the old romance of river ship)- 
ping. We may only guess what it 
was like when we look upon the 
Ohio and the truncated Missis- 
sippi. 

And transcontinental shipping 
is somewhat more difficult, with 
trucks and the freight-railroads 
obliged to take the sea-ferries 
across the Nebraska Sea. We shall 
never know what the United 
States was like with its numerous 
coast-to-coast highways busy with 
trucks and private cars. Still, the 
ferry ride is certainly a welcome 
break after days of driving, and 
for those who wish a glimpse of 
what it must have been like, 
there is always the Cross-Canada 
Throughway and the magnificent 
U. S. Highway 73 looping north 
through Minnesota and passing 



through the giant port of Alexis, 
North Dakota, shipping center 
for the wheat of Manitoba and 
crossroad of a nation. 

ri^HE POLITICAL situation 
has long been a thorny prob- 
lem. Only tattered remnants of 
the eight submerged states re- 
mained after the flood, but none 
of them wanted to surrender its 
autonomy. The tiny fringe of 
Kansas seemed, for a time, ready 
to merge with contiguous Mis- 
souri, but following the lead of 
the Arkansas Forever faction, the 
remaining population decided to 
retain political integrity. This has 
resulted in the continuing anom- 
aly of the seven “fringe States” 
represented in Congress by the 
usual two Senators each, though 
the largest of them is barely the 
size of Connecticut and all are 



economically indistinguishable 



42 



GALAXY 



from their neighboring states. 

Fortunately it was decided 
some years ago that Oklahoma, 
only one of the eight to have 
completely disappeared, could not 
in any sense be considered to 
have a continuing political exist- 
ence. So, though there are still 
families who proudly call them- 
selves Oklahomans, and the Ok- 
lahoma Oil Company continues 
to pump oil from its submerged 
real estate, the state has in fact 
disappeared from the American 
political scene. 

But this is by now no more 
than a petty annoyance, to raise 
a smile when the talk gets 
around to the question of State’s 
Rights. Not even the tremendous 
price the country paid for its new 
sea — fourteen million dead, un- 
told property destroyed — really 
offsets the asset we enjoy today. 
The heart of the continent, now 
open to the shipping of the world, 
was once dry and land-locked, 
cut off from the bustle of trade 
and the ferment of world culture. 

It would indeed seem odd to 
an American of the ’50s or ’60s 
of the last century to imagine 
sailors from the merchant fleets 
of every nation walking the 



streets of Denver, fresh ashore at 
Newport, only fifteen miles away. 
Or to imagine Lincoln, Fargo, 
Kansas City and Dallas as world 
ports and great manufacturing 
centers. Utterly beyond their ken 
would be Roswell, New Mexico; 
Benton, Wyoming; Westport, 
Missouri, and the other new ports 
of over a million inhabitants each 
which have developed on the new 
harbors of the inland sea. 

Unimaginable too would have 
been the general growth of popu- 
lation in the states surrounding 
the new sea. As the water tables 
rose and manufacturing and trade 
moved in to take advantage of 
the just-created axis of world 
communication, a population ex- 
plosion was touched off of which 
we are only now seeing the dimi- 
nuation. This new westering is to 
be ranked with the first surge of 
pioneers which created the Amer- 
ican west. But what a difference! 
Vacation paradises bloom, a new 
fishing industry thrives; her wa- 
ter road is America’s main artery 
of trade, and fleets of all the 
world sail . where once the 
prairie schooner made its labori- 
ous and dusty way west!

By LESTER DEL REY 



I T WAS hours after the last 
official ceremony before Clif- 
ton could escape the crowd of 
planetlubbers with their bab- 
blings, their eligible daughters 
and their stupid self-admiration. 
They’d paid through the nose to 
get him here, and they meant to 
get their money’s worth. 

The exit led only to a little bal- 
cony, but it seemed to be de- 
serted. He took a deep breath of 
the night air and his eyes moved 
unconsciously toward the stars. 

Coming back to Earth had 
been a mistake, but he’d needed 
the money. Space Products Un- 
limited wanted a real deepspace 



hero to help celebrate its hun- 
dredth anniversary. He had just 
finished the Regulation of Rigel, 
so he’d been picked. Damn them 
and their silly speeches and 
awards — and damn Earth! What 
was one planet when there were 
a biljion up there among the 
stars? 

From the other side of a potted 
plant there was a soft sigh. 

Clifton swung his head, then 
relaxed as he saw the other man 
was not looking at him. The 
eyes behind the dark glasses were 
directed toward the sky. 

“Aldebaran, Sirius, Deneb, Al- 
pha Centauri,” the voice whis- 



44 



GALAXY 



pered. It was a high-pitched voice 
with an odd accent, but there was 
the poetry of ancient yearning in 
it. 

He was a small, shriveled old 
man. His shoulders were bent. A 
long beard and the dark glasses 
covered most of his face, but 
could not entirely conceal the 
deep wrinkles, even in the moon- 
light. 

Clifton felt a sudden touch of 
pity and moved closer, without 
quite knowing why. “Didn’t I see 
you on the platform?” 

“Your memory is very good. 
Captain. I was awarded publicly 
— for fifty years of faithful serv- 
ice making space boots. Well, I 
was always a good cobbler, and 
perhaps my boots helped some 
men out there.” The old man’s 
hand swept toward the stars, then 
fell back to grip the railing tightly. 
“They gave me a gold watch, 
though time means nothing to 
me. And a cheap world cruise 
ticket. As if there were any spot 
on this world I could still want to 
see.” He laughed harshly. “For- 
give me if I sound bitter. But, you 
see, I’ve never been off Earth!” 

Clifton stared at him incredu- 
lously. “But everyone — ” 

“Everyone but me,” the old 
man said. “Oh, I tried. I was ut- 
terly weary of Earth and I looked 
at the stars and dreamed. But I 
failed the early rigid physicals. 
Then, when things were easier, I 



tried again. A plague grounded 
the first ship. A strike delayed 
another. Then one exploded on 
the pad and only a few on board 
were saved. It was then I realized 
I was meant to wait here — here 
on Earth, and nowhere else. So I 
stayed, making space boots.” 

T>ITY and impulse forced un- 
expected words to Clifton’s 
lips. “I’m taking off for Rigel 
again in four hours, and there’s a 
spare cabin on the Maryloo. 
You’re coming with me.” 

The old hand that gripped his 
arm was oddly gentle. “Bless you. 
Captain. But it would never work. 
I’m under orders to remain here.” 
“Nobody can order a man 
grounded forever. You’re coming 
with me if I have to drag you, 
Mr.—” 

“Ahasuerus.” 

The old man hesitated, as if 
expecting the name to mean 
something. Then he sighed and 
lifted his dark glasses. 

Clifton met the other’s gaze for 
less than a second. Then his own 
eyes dropped, though memory of 
what he had seen was already 
fading. He vaulted over the bal- 
cony railing and began running 
away from Ahasuerus, toward his 
ship and the unconfined reaches 
of space. 

Behind him, the eternal wan- 
derer tarried and waited.

lent wing to their rapidly fleeing 
heels. 

The fires quickly burned 
through the thatching, sending 
little fingers of flame dancing 
along the lashed saplings that 
supported the roofs. Luke took 
one last look around the interior 
of his hut and started to leave, 
when he spotted something wrig- 
gling under a pile of skins. 

Crossing the room in three 
strides, he tore away the cover- 
ings and grabbed the native child 
by the scruff of its neck. He 
wheeled on one heel and re- 
traced his passage. He got out of 
the door just as the saplings gave 
up the ghost and the fiery mass 
crashed to the ground. 

Luke whistled and wiped 
sweat from his brow. The bronze 
head of the axe caught and re- 
flected the fires from its myriad 
beaten facets. Using the head, he 
beat out several sparks that had 
landed on his clothes, then 
turned his attention to the child 
who still dangled from his other 
hand. 

The child’s eyes were rolled 
nearly into his head with his 
fright. Luke grinned, baring his 
teeth. He brought the child up 
until their noses were less than 
an inch apart. The fetid smell of 
the child’s breath made him 
choke. Yelping, the child twisted 
free and ran after its already- 
departed parents. 



Luke laughed and turned his 
attention to his team. 

The men were all out now, 
watching the huts crack under 
the intense heat within. One 
shuddered, then collapsed in- j 
ward, sending up choking clouds | 
of dust as it smothered the j 
flames. After a moment, Luke j 
whistled. Half of the men melted | 
into the grass and followed the 
natives, while the others gathered | 
around him, squatting and rest- 
ing their axes on the ground. 
Luke waited until the others re- 
turned to report no further sign 
of the villagers, then he squatted 
himself, and accepted a canteen 
from someone. He drank his fill, , 
gasped, wiped the back of his 
hand across his mouth and hand- 
ed the canteen back. 

“It’s hot,” he said, conversa- 
tionally. 

“It’ll be hotter before we’re 
done,” said one of the team. They 
were all dressed in rough-cured 
skins and leather moccasins. The 
axes were the only tool they car- 
ried. Faces thick with war paint 
and grime, it was impossible to 
tell them from natives. 

“Anybody hurt?” asked Luke. 
Disclaimers came from the vari- 
ous members of the group. 
“Good.” He stood up and 
stretched. “Well, gentlemen, shall 
we be on our way?” 

“Might as well.” 

Luke took his axe, twisted the 



48

unfinished handle a quarter-turn 
in his socket, then held the head 
to his lips. “Team B,” he said. 
“Mission accomplished.” He 
twisted the handle back and slip- 
ped the axe into his belt. A few 
moments later, the soft chatter 
of rotcfrs cut through the air, and 
a copter dropped into the clear- 
ing by the cooking fire. 

The team mounted by the dy- 
ing glow of the fires. As soon as 
the last man was in, the door 
swung shut and the copter took 
off into the night. 

S AM CARTER eased the 
scratchy material of the ruf- 
fed collar away from his neck, 
then shot his cuffs to return them 
to the socially acceptable half- 
inch showing beyond his jacket 
sleeve. He sighed, placed his 
hands on his knees and glanced 
for the umpteenth time at the 
armored soldiers guarding the 
door between the anteroom and 
Prince Kahl’s private chambers. 
The afternoon sun dipped below 
the level of the high window- 
slits, sending shadows scamper- 
ing up the walls. 

Sam had been waiting since 
noon. His stomach was repeating 
its rumbled protests against that 
interrupted meal. Prince Kahl 
had sent word that Sam might 
wait upon his pleasure; quieting 
misgivings. Carter had rushed to 
do just that. 



He sighed again, and stifled 
a yawn. From the corner of his 
eye, he watched the shadow line 
marching up the wall. When it 
touched the cobwebby corner of 
the ceiling, a slave came in and 
lighted a pair of oil lamps. The 
soot-heavy smoke they gave off 
quickly had Sam wishing the 
room had been left in darkness. 

Another interminable hour 
passed, during which he several 
times repeated the operation with 
collar and cuffs, all the while en- 
vying the guards their ability to 
remain in one position like frozen 
statues, seemingly carved from 
the living rock of the palace. At 
last, just when he had resigned 
himself to the probability of 
spending the night in the ante- 
room, the inner door swung open 
and a chamberlain beckoned. 

“Prince Kahl will grant you a 
moment now.” 

Sam bowed his thanks, and 
followed the man into Kahl’s 
chambers. 

“Ah, my friend from the south- 
ern kingdoms!” 

Prince Kahl was a lean, sat- 
urnine individual, uncomfortably 
aware that the prime of life was 
slipping through his grasp while 
his father obstinately held onto 
the throne. It was Kahl’s consid- 
ered opinion that the old man 
had lived long enough. It rank- 
led him to realize that he had 
held the same opinions as a

youth barely out of his teens. 
The thirty intervening years had 
been spent devising and trying 
methods to assure his succession; 
unfortunately his father had 
twenty years before that to safe- 
guard his own rule. 

“How go the southern king- 
doms, my friend?” Kahl waved 
a particularly enticing fruit as 
Carter stopped short, a dozen 
paces away. 

“Tolerably well, your gracious- 
ness.” He neglected to add that 
it had been nearly a year since 
he had visited the supposed lands 
of his birth. Kahl was fully aware 
how long Carter had been kept 
cooling his heels. Palace protocol 
dictated how long foreign visitors 
might be kept waiting. But even 
visiting royalty could not hope 
for an audience in less than a 
month’s time. In his role as am- 
bassador, Carter was happy that 
a year was all he had been kept 
waiting. 

i6V7^0UR lord and master’s 
-*■ gifts were received,” said 
Kahl. “You may inform him of 
my royal gratitude.” 

“My humble thanks, your gra- 
ciousness.” Sam’s mouth watered 
as Kahl polished off the one 
fruit and selected another from 
a platter born by a manservant. 
Despite his now-long stay on the 
planet, Sam still could not under- 
stand why women were given no 



r 



role at all in society, even as 
slaves. 

“Not at all, not at all,” said ' 
Kahl. “Now tell me. What is it j 
that brought you so far from 
your home lands to grace my ; 
humble presence?” ' 

“The usual business of politic, 
your graciousness,” said Sam, 
growing weary of the necessity to 
repeat the title with every reply 
to Kahl’s words. He also wished 
for a chair, despite the fact that 
he had been sitting all afternoon. ' 
He felt like a naughty school- 
child, standing always in the 
man’s presence. “Trade treaties, 
mutual armament pacts, the 
like.” 

“Ummm, so. You’ve discussed 
them with my ministers?” 

“They have permitted me this 
honor and, if I may be so bold, 
found a great deal to our mutual 
liking. Our countries are indeed 
far separated, and the journey 
between arduous. I find much in 
your provinces in the way of 
technology and armaments that 
we totally lack. By the same • 
token, I have thought of a few 
inconsequential things which 
might serve to ease your royal , 
burdens, if but brought from my ! 
lands.” 

“Possible, possible,” said Kahl. 
“Of course, I have a large college 
of tinkerers and mechanics who 
probably would have produced 
the little toys you speak of in 



jfieir own good time. But why 
duplicate effort, eh? They are 
lazy dolts who grumble at my 
royal largesse as it is.” He chor- 
tled lustily, although Sam could 
see nothing even remotely hu- 
morous in his statement. But he 
was well-schooled in the idiocies 
of diplomacy; he laughed duti- 
fully- 

“But come!” said Kahl. 
“Enough of childish prattle! You 
carry another load in your 
thoughts, my southern friend. 
Have out with it!” 

“Your graciousness?” 

“You needn’t pretend,” he said, 
chortling again. “My ministers 
are like the winds. They cannot 
keep a single thing to themselves, 
but instead need spread it over 
the far reaches of the entire 
world. You’ve been talking — 
foolishly perhaps — but I have 
perceived a certain sense within 
your nonsense, and I must con- 
fess that your words have 
aroused my interest. You have a 
plan to see me king. Now out 
with it, lest I make you a gift of 
you to my torturer. He can re- 
move anything — including stub- 
born vocal cords!” 

“You do me undeserved honor, 
graciousness,” said Sam. 

“Undoubtedly. And you begin 
to weary me.” 

“Very well.” Sam sighed. “I 
must admit that my tongue is too 
loose for my own general welfare. 

THE PROBLEM MAKERS 



It is true that I once thought of 
something mildly amusing while 
passing long evening hours with 
one of your ministers. But it was 
mere idle dreaming, no more.” 
“You prattle long, southerner.” 
Kahl’s eyelids lowered suspici- 
ously. He picked up a silver knife 
and began paring his nails, scat- 
tering the shavings suggestively 
in Sam’s direction. “Perhaps you 
do not want to see me king?” 
“There is none so deserving of 
the honor as you,” said Sam. “But 
while you laugh at the utter 
childishness of my ideas, please 
remember that you insisted . 

T he Ehrlan delegate to the 
Central Worlds Conference 
was well past the entrance to the 
Park when the pudgy little man 
caught up with him, sides heav- 
ing from the unaccustomed strain 
of running. 

“Citizen Lund!” he cried, pant- 
ing. “Please wait!” 

Lund turned and eyed the 
little man suspiciously. The fel- 
low was a stranger, and therefore 
automatically under suspicion. 
“Yes?” 

“A moment of your valuable 
time. Citizen. Please? I assure 
you, you have nothing to fear 
from me. I am not a Yanoian.” 
The name spattered out acidly. 

“Indeed?” said Lund. “And 
just who, then, are you?” There 
was a vague sensation of familiar- 



50

ity troubling the back of his 
mind. The omnipresent watch- 
dog in his subconscious pounced 
instantly on the feeling, magnify- 
ing it, turning it inside out and 
shaking it around, but drawing 
no satisfaction from the act. 

“A friend. Citizen. You must 
believe that. I can’t explain 
further right now — time is too 
precious.” He grabbed Lund’s 
arm and started tugging him 
back towards the Park entrance. 
“Please? I beg you, come.” 

“Oh — very well.” He gave in 
ungraciously, following the man 
until they \^ere just inside the 
Park. Then Lund stopped, dig- 
ging his heels into the gravel of 
the walk. The man looked back 
at him. 

“Please, Citizen!” he urged. 
“We don’t have much time!” 

‘So far as I’m concerned, you 
don’t have any time at all, unless 
you tell me right now who you 
are and what this is all about.” 

“Not here!” he cried, aghast, 
as he glanced nervously around 
at the many people entering and 
leaving the Park. A pair of Con- 
ference monitors stopped just 
outside the gate, fingering their 
stun-beamers as they eyed the 
actions of the two men. They 
started to move into the 
violable hundred-foot circle this 
side of the gate. The little man 
moved quickly, grabbing Lund 
again and forcibly pulling him 



beyond the protection of the 
monitors. Their skins tingled as 
they went through the shimmer- 
ing haze of the force screen. The ' 
monitors stopped just in time to ’ 
avoid touching the screen, while > 
Lund and the little man hurried | 
down a path that wound into a , 
copse of widdy trees from Lund’s 
own homeworld, Ehrla. 

The widdy tendrils stopped 
their aimless flowing through the 
trees and curved down and 
around the two men, tips melting i 
into the ground and tendrils 
broadening into wide blades that 
sheltered and shielded the pair 
from possible watchers. 

“Now!” said Lund, shaking the | 
other man’s hand from his ang- i 
rily. “Perhaps you will do me the i 
honor of telling me who you are 
and just what in the name of the 
Seven Holy Suns this idiocy is i 
all about?” 

“A matter of the gravest ur- 
gency, Citizen! You must not | 
present your plans for redistribu- ' 
tion of Sector protectorates to j 
this Conference!” 

“What?” Lund stared at him 
in disbelief. “And just how did 
you learn of the plans I intend 
to present to the Conference — I 
wi// present, at this afternoon 
session? Something smacks of 
treachery!” 

“Never mind how I learned. 
Citizen. The important thing is 
the Yano delegation also knows!

They plan to scuttle you before 
you have a chance to speak. After 
that, they’ll cut you into little 
pieces and devour you!” 

“You’re insane, man!” Lund 
started to reach for the widdy 
tendrils. 

“Don’t! You must not present 
your plans to the Conference, 
Citizen.” 

A new tone had crept into the 
man’s voice: a strength that be- 
lied the pudginess and general 
clownishness of the figure. Lund 
turned slowly, and found himself 
staring at a stunner, the winking 
red of the telltale showing that 
it was set to lethal bands. 

“Wha . •” He gulped his 
adam’s apple back down into his 
throat. “How did you get that 
into the Park? The force screens 
aren’t supposed to pass weapons.” 
“There are ways. Citizen,” the 
man said, grinning. No longer did 
he seem clownish. “Many so- 
called impossible things are quite 
simple, if only you have access 
to the proper people and con- 
trols.” 

“What do you really want?” 
Lund tried to hide his fright, but 
he was uncomfortably certain 
that it was radiating out from 
him, broadcasting to the entire 
world that Citizen Lund was 
scared silly. 

“I told you. Citizen. You must 
not present your plans to the 
Conference.” 



“But why?” he wailed, in frus- 
tration. “Give me a logical rea- 
son!” 

“The greater good. Citizen.” 
With those cryptic words, the 
man pressed the stud of the 
beamer. Lund gasped, as a giant 
hand closed around his heart, 
then collapsed to the ground in 
a strange dying parody of slow 
motion. Just before the clouds of 
eternity shut away his vision, he 
at last recognized the man. 

Himself!

J OHN REILLY was tired, in- 
tensely tired, beyond any 
feeling of exhaustion he had ever 
known. 

The clock in his desk chimed 
once. He sighed and picked up 
his lecture notes, stuffing them 
into a scarred and battered case 
that he had been carrying since 
his student days at the Academy. 
He cast one weary glance around 
the cluttered office, then steeled 
himself into a passable imitation 
of military carriage as he left for 
the lecture hall. 

The Cadet Sergeant-Major 
outside his door leaped to atten- 
tion only a little less quickly 
than his regular service counter- 
part. Reilly returned their sal- 
utes and fell in behind them. 
The lecture hall — gymnasi-

um, really; the Academy was per- 
enially overcrowded — was 
crowded, as usual. The eager 
young cadets filled the fifty rows 
of backless benches, while the 
overflow squatted and stood at 
the rear until it was impossible 
for a midget to find room to 
thread his way through the 
crowd. Reilly’s class was well- 
tended for its honest popularity, 
not just because it was compul- 
sory. There were many “com- 
pulsory” lectures in the curricul- 
um that counted themselves 
proud to find half their audience 
in attendance. 

Reilly stopped in the wings 
of the stage, listening for a mo- 
ment to the comfortable discord- 
ances of the student band tuning 
their instruments. The regular 
service non-com peered through 
the hangings, catching the band- 
master’s eye. The tuning stopped, 
and the band swung into a med- 
ley of old Academy drinking 
songs. Reilly smiled, as he re- 
membered happier days when 
he had participated lustily in the 
drinking that went along with 
such music. 

From ^he drinking songs, the 
band struck up the National An- 
them. The noise the cadets made 
in rising nearly drowned out the 
music. After the last strains had 
been permitted to fade away, the 
bandmaster raised his baton once 
more and the opening bars of 



Hail to the Chief! filled the hall. 
The Sergeants-Major stepped 
out onto the stage, Reilly follow- 
ing, case clasped loosely between 
elbow and side. 

They passed in front of the 
half-dozen visitors and moved to 
either side of the podium, turn- 
ing until they were facing each 
other, the regular service man on 
the right. They snapped into a 
salute, followed by the entire au- 
dience. Reilly lay his case on the 
podium, turned and bowed to the 
visitors, then faced the audience 
again and returned the salute. 

Immediately two thousand 
arms dropped to their owners’ 
sides and the cadets resumed 
their seats. 

Reilly unzipped his case and 
drew out his notes. 

He arranged them carefully oi^ 
the podium, although he knew 
that at no time during the next 
hour would he so much as glance 
at them again. The case stowed 
away under the podium, he took 
a deep breath and placed his 
hands flat on the podium’s sur- 
face. Technicians in the control 
booth over the far end of the hall 
trained parabolic mikes on his 
lips, waiting for him to begin the 
lecture as he had begun hundreds 
of other preceding lectures, be- 
fore audiences much like this. 
The faces might change; the uni- 
forms were the same, and so were 
the underlying feelings of the 



54 



galaxy 



wearers of the uniforms, year in 
and year out. 

“The greater good for the 
greater number!” 

The cadets let out a mutual 
sigh, none aware that breath had 
been held. 

“A motto, gentlemen: merely 
a motto. Like Ad Astra per As- 
pera, E Pluribus Unum or 
Through These Portals Pass the 
Most Wonderful Custonters in 
the Galaxy.” An appreciative tit- 
ter ran through the audience. 

“But what is a motto?” con- 
tinued Reilly, warming to his 
subject, overly familiar though 
it was. “It’s more than just a 
snappy way of stringing words 
together. It has a meaning. Often 
the meaning, such as in the com- 
mercial example I just gave, is 
on the frivolous side. But more 
often there is something intently 
serious behind a motto. Ad Astra 
— ‘To the Stars.’ For centuries 
this has been almost a religion 
for men, as our ancestors broke 
the bonds of a single planet and 
spread out into the galaxy. Li- 
braries have been written of the 
heartbreaks and joys, the sor- 
rows and jubilations that have 
been found in the far reaches of 
space. 

“E Pluribus Unum — ‘United 
We Stand.’ Even older and, if 
possible, dearer to the hearts of 
men. Our very government is 
based on the essential concept 



contained in these three words 
from the past. 

“ ‘The greater good for the 
greater number’. If government 
runs on one motto, then civil- 
ization is based on this!” 

T eam B was dead on its feet 
when the copter finally re- 
turned to Base with the first rosy 
glow of dawn lightening the hor- 
izon. They stumbled to the 
ground, as sorry a looking group 
as Luke Royceton had ever seen. 
Their masquerade of grime and 
war paints was nearly obscured 
by an honest layer of general 
dirt. They filed into wardrobe 
and stripped off their clothes, 
leaving them in ragged piles on 
the floor. Then they hit the 
showers, luxuriating under the 
needle sprays and the caress of 
soap sliding over their skin. 

The discarded costumes were 
gone when they emerged, feeling 
closer to human, twenty minutes 
later. In place of the animal hid'es 
were shorts, doublets and the 
calf-length boots of Base-cen- 
tered personnel. 

All were more than happy to 
be back in uniform. 

Luke stopped outside ward- 
robe for a moment, then started 
towards Headquarters, a building 
distinguished from the dozen 
other prefabs of. Base only by 
the pennant flying from the peak. 
The buildings were arranged in

an irregular circle around the 
copter field, nestled in the most 
hidden valley of the planet’s 
single range of hills high enough 
to be graced with the name of 
mountains. The highest peak in 
the range, visible over the one 
directly behind Headquarters, 
toward barely a thousand feet. 

On a world less primitive, the 
range would never have served 
its present duty. 

The world was primitive, how- 
ever. Man had advanced but a 
few faltering steps beyond the 
level of the cave. Ecology had es- 
timated the native human popu- 
lation not to exceed three million 
people over the entire globe, and 
cheerfully admitted that their 
estimate was made with every 
benefit of doubt given to the na- 
tives. Quite possibly not even 
half that number roamed the 
vast plains of the temperate 
zones, or breeded in the opulence 
of the equatorial jungles. As yet, 
population pressures had not 
driven men into the colder 
climes of the north and south. 
None had been spotted more 
than five hundred miles from the 
equator. 

Luke checked in with the Or- 
derly Room before reporting on 
to the debriefing room. He 
slumped onto a couch and prop- 
ped his feet on a low coffee table. 
The other four team command- 
ers were there ahead of him. One 



brought him a cup of coffee. He 
accepted it with thanks, and in- 
haled the bitter smell of the 
brew before draining half of it. 
The fiery liquid burned into his 
stomach and scorched away 
some of the tensions built up dur- 
ing the night. 

“Rough night, Luke?” asked 
Andy Singer, sitting next to him. 

“The roughest. We hit seven- 
teen villages between sunset and 
sunrise.” 

“That is a load. My team only 
hit seven. But you were work- 
ing the big river stretch, weren’t 
you?” Luke nodded, as he sipped 
again at his coffee. “I thought so. 
We were lucky. We had the west 
plains. There isn’t too much 
water over there, couple little 
creeks and a few holes. These 
locals don’t stray too far from 
water.” 

hit half a dozen good- 
sized places,” said Luke. 
“One of them must have had 
thirty-five families. For a min- 
ute, I thought we were going to 
have to kill a few of them, but 
it ended up okay. Nobody hurt, 
except for one of my boys who 
stayed a second too long in a 
hut.” He chuckled. “Got the seat 
of his pants burned off — a new ' 
kid, just out from the Academy. 
The rest of the night, he was the 
fastest man I had.” 

“Proves what I said about 



water. Biggest place I hit had 
seven houses, and most of them 
only had two or three.” 

Luke started to say something 
more, but just then the door 
opened and the Base Comman- 
dant came in. The Team com- 
manders stood up respectfully, 
but none had the energy to prop- 
erly snap to attention. He smiled 
as he mounted the low platform 
to the front of the room. 

“At ease, gentlemen.” Grate- 
fully, the commanders sat back 
down and resumed their earlier 
positions of comfort. The Com- 
mandant poured himself a glass 
of water from a ready pitcher 
and drank it, then gave his full 
attention to the room. 

“First, gentlemen, let me con- 
gratulate you on a successful 
night’s operation. I congratulate 
all of you, but particularly Com- 
mander Royceton and Team B. 
They rolled up the enviable total 
of seventeen villages destroyed.” 

Luke flushed, feeling like a 
fresh-out-of-Academy Cadet as 
the others raised their coffee cups 
in his direction. 

“None of you spent the even- 
ing slacking, of course,” continued 
the Commandant. He was a mid- 
dle-aged man; the empty sleeve 
pinned to his shoulder told why 
he had been booted out of field 
duty while men twenty years 
his senior were still leading 
teams. “Total score for the night; 



fifty-seven villages. Commander 
Royceton merely had more fer- 
tile area to work in. As we move 
out from the Base I know you 
will all have equal opportunities 
to prove your prowess with the 
torch.” An appreciative murmur 
ran through the little group. 

“Now I know you’re all tired, 
gentlemen, and anxious to hit 
the sack. I won’t keep you much 
longer. I just want to emphasize 
the importance of our mission on 
this world. Many of your men 
don’t like making these raids on 
the natives. They would rather 
be roaming the far starlanes, put- 
ting down pirates and other glor- 
ious deeds of derring-do. But you 
men are not cadets; there isn’t a 
one of you without twenty years 
field service time. You know the 
real glory comes from satisfac- 
tion in a job well done. It is up to 
you to transfer that feeling of 
satisfaction to the malcontents 
within your ranks. Tonight you 
go out again; and you will con- 
tinue to do so until every single 
village on this planet has been 
razed to the ground! If so much 
as one single village is permitted 
to escape, then we have failed. I 
do not like failure; you do not 
like failure. Working together, we 
can see to it that failure as a 
word disappears from the lan- 
guage. I thank you, gentlemen. 
Dismissed.” He stepped down 
and strode rapidly from the

room. Behind him the audience 
rose and burst into talk. 

Ill 

CAM CARTER moaned silent- 
^ ly. He tried for the hun- 
dredth time since the journey 
began to shift his legs into a posi- 
tion where the insides would not 
be rubbed raw by the rough hair 
of his horse-like mount. He re- 
solved for the dozenth time that 
one of the “inventions” he would 
import from the southern prov- 
inces would be a good, comfort- 
able saddle. 

Another would be silk; the 
rough fabrics worn by Kahl’s sub- 
jects were a fair substitute for 
the mount’s hide. 

“Ho, southerner!” Prince Kahl 
wheeled his mount back from 
the head of the column and 
waited until Sam had caught up, 
then he fell in beside him. “How 
goes it? Does my second favor- 
ite mount suit you well?” 

“Very well indeed, gracious- 
ness,” said Sam. “I cannot in 
honesty recall when I’ve had a 
more — ouch ! — instructive ride!” 
“Good!” Kahl leaned over and 
slapped him on the shoulder. 
“You’ll be glad to know we’ve but 
three more hours to go before 
reaching the summer palaces.” 
“Only, uh, three more hours?” 
The sinking sensation in Sam’s 
stomach had nothing at all to do 

58 



with the undulating motion of his 
beast. “Ah, that is good news, 
your graciousness. We’ll be there 
almost before we know it.” 

Sam wished Kahl would go 
away and leave him to his mis- 
ery, but the prince seemed dis- 
posed to talk. “I. think there will 
be many surprised faces in my 
father’s court tonight. Eh, south- 
erner?” He chuckled, and then 
burst into raucous laughter as he 
considered the idea further. “And 
to think, it will all be perfectly 
legal! You have the papers safe, 
my friend?” 

“Yes, your graciousness,” said 
Sam, sighing and patting his 
saddlebags. 

“Good! Don’t lose them — I’d 
hate to see you missing your 
head!” He laughed again, while 
Sam’s stomach turned several 
more flipflops. “The sight of 
blood always did make me sick.” 

There were sixteen men in the 
mounted party, including a 
dozen of Kahl’s private guard, 
the captain of the troop and the 
High Priest of the Sun God, the 
nation’s officially sponsored reli- 
gion. The High Priest was a little 
old man, bent over more from 
age than from the discom- 
forts of the journey. Originally 
Sam had planned for one more 
member, but that had become 
unnecessary when he learned 
that the High Priest was also 
President of the Royal College 

GALAXY 






of Chirurgeons. The latter role 
was even more important to his 
plans than the former. Now all 
that worried Sam was the possi- 
bility that the priest might not 
live to the end of the journey. He 
was inflicted witth a hacking 
cough that sent chills racing up 
and down Sam’s spine every time 
he went into a fit. 

Kahl grew weary of bantering 
small talk with a man really fit 
to come up with witty replies. He 
wheeled his horse again and 
dropped back to the end of the 
column for a moment, saying 
something to the High Priest, 
then he spurred his mount back 
to the head of the line, falling 
into his original position beside 
the Captain of the Guard. The 
two men were soon lost in rem- 
iniscences that had bored Sam 
to tears, every time he had been 
an unwilling audience. 

A NOTHER hour passed miser- 
ably, while the sun mounted 
to the zenith and began the long 
summer afternoon drop back 
down to the horizon. The mem- 
bers of the Guard and Kahl 
pulled short , stubby loaves of 
bread and cheese from their sad- 
dle bags and munched as they 
road on, washing the food down 
with vigorous pulls at the wine- 
skins that took the place of water 
canteens on the planet. Sam had 
first thought the constant imbib- 



ing of alcohol to be a national 
vice. Then he ran tests on half a 
dozen waterholes. Thereafter he 
drank wine himself. 

Now, however, he was com- 
pletely without an appetite. 
Looking back over his shoulder, 
he saw that the priest was in the 
same boat. Suddenly, without 
knowing why, he pulled his 
mount up and waited until the 
priest caught up with him, then 
fell in at the end of the column. 

“How goes it. Reverence?” 

The priest looked up, watery 
eyes registering surprise at his 
company. “Oh, southerner.” He 
broke into one of his coughing 
spasms. “Ahhh, not well, south- 
erner. Not well at all. The Sun 
God does not ride with me this 
day — not that he’s deserted me, 
you understand: he never rides 
with me. The Sun God has more 
sense than a foolish old man who 
should be staying home in the 
comfort of his apartments, not 
galivanting around the country- 
side like a frisky kitten.” 

“I wish he had imparted some 
of his wisdom to me,” said Sam. 
“I confess I feel as you look, Rev- 
erence. No disrespect intended, 
believe me. It’s just that the ar- 
dors of this journey have taken 
much toll from both of us. And 
I swear, by the Sun God himself, 
you are bearing up much better 
than I.” 

“A man who has traveled as 



60 



GALAXY 



long and as far as you talking 
this, southerner?” 

“It’s the way you travel. Rev- 
erence. The greatest part of my 
journey was by ship.” It had 
been; Sam merely neglected to 
specify that it was a spaceship. 
“Ocean travel has its own pecul- 
iar discomforts, but for myself. 
I’ll take it every time.” 

“Tell me, southerner,” said the 
priest, “why do you make this 
trip?” 

“Prince Kahl wished it,” he 
replied. 

“Ah, but there is more to this 
than lies on the surface. Why 
should Kahl bring you, a stran- 
ger and a subject of another 
house, along on a venture that 
may well ’cast the future course 
of events for this entire nation?” 

“Prince Kahl seems to feel 
that, ah, I might, because of my 
experiences in other lands, serve 
him in some minor capacity of 
usefulness.” Sam chose his words 
with care. The old man was en- 
tirely too observant for his liking. 

“Kahl is an astute man,” said 
the priest. “However, he is also 
a hungry man, and such a man 
on the verge of starvation will 
eat things that in more normal 
circumstances he would pass up 
without so much as a first look. 
Ideas are much like food, south- 
erner.” 

“The philosophers of my coun- 
try have a saying. Reverence. 



‘Man does not live by bread 
alone.’ ” 

“Much wisdom is afloat in the 
world, disguised in strange ways.” 
With that, the priest went into 
another coughing spell, after 
which he refused to pick up the 
threads of the conversation. Car- 
ter gave up, and spurred his 
mount back to his original place 
in the column. 

T he rest of the trip passed in, 
for Sam, self-commiseration. 
The lower the sun sank, the hot- 
ter the temperature seemed to 
climb. Several times he found 
himself with wineskin raised to 
lips. The native beverage was 
little stronger than the plain 
water he would have preferred, 
but even so he found himself 
more than a little tipsy by the 
time they crested a low range 
of hills and saw the summer pal- 
aces nestled by the side of a lake 
in the valley below. 

The column dismounted in an 
inner courtyard, and Kahl, Car- 
ter and the High Priest strode 
past the protesting chamberlain 
into the King’s private apart- 
ments. The King was lying on a 
couch, eating fruits served by a 
manservant and listening to poetr 
ry being read to him. He looked 
up when the trio came in. 

“My son! This is indeed an 
unexpected honor. What brings 
you from the city on a day so hot 



THE PROBLEM MAKERS 



61 



as this one?” He smiled, but his 
eyes were sharp. 

“Greetings, Father,” said Kahl, 
bowing low. “I bring you import- 
ant news from the Council of 
Priests. Reverence!” 

“Y our Most Graciousness.” 
The old man was already nearly 
doubled over. ^Vhen he bowed, 
Sam half expected to hear his 
forehead crack the tiles of the 
floor. 

“Well, Reverence?” The king 
accepted another fruit and 

sucked on it, keeping a watchful 
eye on his son. He suspects some- 
thing! Sam thought. 

The High Priest produced a 
scroll from his robes and cere- 
moniously broke the seal. Un- 
rolled, it was short for the dyna- 
mite it contained. 

“Your Most Gracious Person,” 
he read. “The Council of Priests, 
meet and determined in the Holy 
Temple of the Sun God this 
fifth day of the seventh moon of 
the fifty-first year of the reign of 
Obar, King, announce to all and 
sundry within the domains of 
Obar, King, that he has incur- 
red the wrath and displeasure 
of the Holy God, the Sun God, 
and henceforth from this day 
shall be no more be known as 
Obar, King, but as father of 
Kahl, King.” 

He let the scroll snap back 
into its cylinder, bowed again, 
then handed the scroll to Obar. 



“Your graciousness.” Then he 
turned to Kahl. “Your Most Gra- 
ciousness.” One final return to 
Obar. “One more message from 
the Council, your graciousness. 
They hope you will accept their 
eternal pleasure and gratitude for 
the excellence of your reign.” 

A LL during the reading, Obar 
had been staring at the High 
Priest, a ghost smile half-crin- 
kling the corners of his mouth. 
The half-eaten fruit now fell to 
the pavement with a sodden 
plop! He licked his lips. 

“This . This is some sort of 
a joke?” 

“No joke. Father,” said Kahl, 
a little too heartily for Sam’s 
liking. 

“But how?” Obar shook his 
head. “How dare you?” 

“I’m merely exercising my 
duty to our subjects. Father. 
You’ve grown old. You’re no 
longer capable of carrying out 
the duties of king.” 

“No.” He refused to believe. 
“You . you have no right. I am 
king! How can you . How can 
you just walk in here and tell 
me that I’m not? What gives you 
this right?” 

“The same source that made 
you king in the first place,” said 
Kahl. “The Sun God.” 

“Nonsense! There is no Sun 
God!” 

The High Priest gasped and ; 



covered his eyes. “Blasphemy!” 

“Guards!” Obar pried himself 
up. “Guards! Arrest these 
maniacs!” 

Feet clumped outside, then 
turned into the chamber. Sam 
relaxed, unaware that he had 
been holding his breath, know- 
ing that his plans were going 
through after all. The men who 
came in were the same who had 
escorted them from the city, 
Kahl’s own private guards. 

The captain turned to Kahl 
and bowed low. “You called. 
Your Most Graciousness?” 

“Yes. Take this blithering idiot 
away.” 

The captain bowed again, and 
gestured. Two of his men grab- 
bed the former king by the arms 
and carried him away, scream- 
ing. 

“Ho, southerner!” Kahl sat 
down on his father’s couch and 
gestured. The manservants had 
been cowering in the back- 
ground; they came forward now 
and touched their foreheads to 
the ground. Kahl took a fruit 
and bit into it, letting the juice 
trickle down his chin. 

“It worked,” said Kahl, swal- 
lowing. “By the Sun God, it 
worked!” He slapped his knee. “I 
confess, southerner, when first I 
heard your plans, I thought you 
daft indeed. But it worked! I’m 
king!” 

“I felt certain it would,” said 



Sam, carefully omitting the title 
of respect. It passed unnoticed. 
More sure of himself, he contin- 
ued, “After all, the idea was 
inherent in the very structure 
and strictures of your govern- 
ment. Your divine position comes 
from the Sun God. He should be 
able to remove it as easily as he 
grants it.” 

“True,” said Kahl. “Howsom- 
ever, there shall be some changes 
made in that respect, once I have 
consolidated my position. Oh, I 
delude myself not in thinking 
that the battle is over, my friend. 
But the hardest part has been 
won.” 

“I’ve been thinking,” said Sam, 
slowly. 

“Well, keep it not to yourself!” 
said Kahl. “If any more of your 
ideas prove as useful to me as 
the last, then you have a glorious 
future indeed.” 

“My thoughts are, I’m afraid, 
roaming rather far afield. But 
take them for what they might 
be worth. You are king of this 
nation now, Kahl; and a very able 
king you shall be. Why limit the 
benefits of your rule to this one 
nation? Why not let the rest of 
the world know the joys of your 
rule?” 

“Ummm?” He squinted, one 
eye closed. “You think it might 
work out?” 

“Why not?” And the Sun God 
help us all! he added to himself.

^1 '^HK chambers were crowded 
■*- as the delegates, alternates 
and just plain onlookers poured 
in for the afternoon session of the 
Central Worlds Conference. Two 
hours before the meeting was due 
to begin, an astute member of 
the press, long used to such func- 
tions, observed that there would 
undoubtedly be 'a record broken 
before the day was over. And it 
was easy to see why: all eyes 
were trained on the spot low in 
the tiers with the Ehrlan pen- 
nant floating overhead. 

As yet, the central figure of 
all the interest had not arrived, 
although the rest of the Ehrlans 
were already in their seats and 
looking anxiously up the aisles 
towards the bank of elevators. 
An elevator would open from 
time to time, to disgorge a few 
late arrivals. But the man they 
expected was not yet among 
them. Below, on the chamber 
floor, the presiding secretary was 
mounting to the rostum and 
arranging his papers. 

“Where the devil can he be!” 
said Citizen Evrett to Citizen 
Sterm, the second ranking mem- 
ber of the delegation. 

“God only knows! You don’t 
suppose something has . hap- 
pened?” 

“How could it, here in the 
heart of the city? He only had 



to come one block from the hotel. 
You’ve been watching too many 
thrillers. Citizen — I hope!” 

“Well, we have to do some- 
thing. The session will be starting 
in a few minutes. If he isn’t here, 
someone else will have to make 
the presentation.” 

“Who?” 

“I don’t know. How about you. 
Citizen?” 

“Now, wait a minute!” said 
Evrett. “What’s the matter with 
you. Citizen? You’re the logical 
choice. You rank second in the 
group.” 

“I wouldn’t dare,” admitted 
Sterm. “What if I should bobble 
things?* I’d never be able to live 
it down. I wouldn’t even dare go 
home. My wife is Lund’s half- 
sister, you know.” 

“I’d forgotten. But somebody 
has to do it, if he doesn’t get here. 
This is the only opportunity we’ll 
have this decade. If we have to 
wait another ten years, we may 
as well forget the matter alto- 
gether.” 

“We can’t do that!” protested 
Sterm. “We’ve worked too long 
and too hard on this plan. It’s the 
only fair solution anyway. The 
other worlds will never accept 
anything else.” 

“Some of them may not want 
to accept this one, when they 
hear all of the details. You must 
admit, we haven’t been too easy 
on some of your fellow members.

They • • ■ Here comes Arko. 
jAayhe he found out something.” 

A junior member of the delega- 
tion came panting down the 
aisle, shaking his head when he 
saw the others’ eyes on him. 
“Sorry, Citizens,” he said, as soon 
as he was within the Ehrlan area. 
“He left the hotel over an hour 
ago. No one has seen a sign of 
him since.” 

“Well, that tears it,” said Ev- 
rett, just as the presiding secre- 
tary struck his gavel on the little 
wooden block, announcing the 
opening of the session. “Who has 
the copy of the plans?” 

“Here,” said Sterm, digging 
the papers from his case. 

“I’ll make the presentation 
myself . .” 

“Just a minute. Citizen!” said 
Arko. “Look! Here he comes 
now!” 

They all turned and looked at 
the pudgy figure ambling slowly 
down the aisle, nodding to greet- 
ings that came from all sides. 
The missing man smiled and 
shook .hands with a couple of the 
onlookers, before entering the 
area and taking his seat at the 
head of the delegation. 

“Citizen Lund!” cried Sterm, 
as though speaking to a wayward 
child. “Where in the name of the 
Seven Suns have you been?” 
“Why, it’s a beautiful day. Citi- 
zens,” explained Lund. “I thought 



I’d take a stroll in the Park. 
There’s quite a large Ehrlan sec- 
tion, you know. Makes one quite 
homesick to hear the singing 
flowers serenading the passerby. 
I can’t wait to get back home 
again.” 

“If you hadn’t shown up, none 
of use would have had the nerve 
to go home!” 

“Why, Citizen Sterm!” Lund 
seemed amused by some private 
joke. “Whatever made you think 
I wouldn’t be here? This is an 
important day for Ehrla, re- 
member?” 

“How could we forget?” said 
Evrett. 

The presiding secretary fiddled 
with his bank of microphones for 
a moment, in the manner of pre- 
siding secretaries throughout 
history since the invention of the 
public address system, then 
turned hopelessly to the techni- 
cians. A man came forward, 
made a simple adjustment, then 
retreated. The Secretary cleared 
his throat, sipped at a glass of 
water and spoke. 

“The fourth session of the 
Nineteenth Conference of the 
Central Worlds is open for busi- 
ness. The afternoon session will 
be devoted to the presentation 
and discussion of proposals by 
the membership. The Recording 
Secretary will call the roll of 
delegations.”

o’clock shadow came forward 
and leaned into the bank of mi- 
crophones, and yelled: “Accryl- 
lia!” 

Across the chamber a man 
stood up, holding his delegation’s 
microphone. “The grand and sov- 
ereign system of Accryllia, long 
known throughout the galaxy for 
the excellence of its citrus fruit, 
the beauty of its maidens, the 
virtue of its honorable young 
men . the grand and sovereign 
state of Accryllia passes.” 
“Antares!” 

“Antares passes.” 

“Bodancer!” 

“The system of Bodancer 
passes.” 

“Buddington!” 

“Mr. Secretary, the proud sys- 
tem of Buddington yields to 
Ehrla!” 

“Ehrla!” 

/^ITIZEN Lund stood up, un- 
^ clipped the mike from the 
railing, smiled around at a few 
more wellwishers and launched 
into his speech. “Mr. Secretary! 
Ehrla wishes to thank the proud 
and ancient system of Budding- 
ton for relinquishing its rightful 
order in these proceedings, so 
that Ehrla may present a plan 
that the citizens of Ehrla feel 
certain will meet with the full ap- 
proval of this meeting. 

“For hundreds of years, the 
various peoples represented here 



today have been rightly con- 
cerned with the problems of new 
star systems being developed, 
new races being assimilated into 
the federation of free and lawful 
worlds. These new worlds need 
guidance, a guidance that only 
long experience can provide.” 

Evrett looked at Sterm, un- 
easily. “What is this?” he whisper- 
ed. “He isn’t presenting the plan 
like this, I hope? He’ll alienate 
half the delegations.” 

“I don’t know what he’s doing,” 
said Sterm. “I only hope he 
knows.” 

“In the past,” continued Lund, 
“the various and varied members 
of this honored organization have 
provided the same guidance in 
wise and infinitely proper man- 
ner. It is the hope of Ehrla that 
they will continue to do so in the 
future. Therefore the ancient and 
honorable system of Ehrla pro- 
poses, to this effect, that the mem- 
bers of this organization continue 
as they have in the past.” 

Pandemonium was breaking 
out in scattered sections of the* 
chamber as various delegations 
realized that they were being 
snookered by the Ehrlans. Voices 
rose up here and there, trying to 
drown out Lund’s words. Moni- 
tors moved up and down the 
aisles, trying to quell the disturb- 
ances. 

“Therefore,” said Lund, “Ehrla, 
to the implementation of its plan. 



announces to this organization 
that this day they have annexed 
the systems of Phelimina, Trepi- 
dar and Scolatia.” 

He sat down and turned to the 
rest of his delegation. “Gentle- 
men,” he said, smiling, as he 
handed a sealed envelope to 
■ Sterm, “my resignation.” 

R eilly slumped in his chair 
with a sigh. The lecture had 
■ gone well, but it had ended not 
a moment too soon to suit him. 

“I’m growing old,” he said, un- 
aware he was speaking out loud. 

“Pardon, sir?” The regular serv- 
ice Sergeant-Major closed the 
I door and brought over his cup of 
I coffee. “Did you say something, 

: sir?” 

I “What?” Reilly blinked. “Oh, 

nothing. Nothing at all. Sergeant. 

I Just an old man muttering to 
himself.” 

j “Begging the general’s pardon, 

1 sir, I don’t think you’re an old 
' man at all. At least, no older 
I than myself.” He cocked his 
j head. “Although, to be perfectly 
honest with both of us, sir, there 
are times when I just can’t seem 
to keep up with these children 
they keep sending us nowadays.” 
“We’re both ready for retire- 
ment, Sergeant. Old work horses, 
ready to be turned out to pas- 
ture. I guess this will be the last 
class I see through these old 
doors. I’ve submitted my resigna- 



tion, you know.” Reilly moodily 
regarded his coffee. 

“Yessir, I knew. The rest of the 
faculty knows too. And if I might 
be so bold as to say so, sir, we’ll 
all be sorry to see you go. It 
won’t be the same Academy 
without General Reilly glarin’ a 
bit at us all.” 

“Glaring a bit, is it. Sergeant?” 
He glared now, then broke down 
into a smile. “I suppose I do at 
that. Do the cadets still call me 
Old Stoneface?” 

“Not within my heaf-ing, sir.” 
He grinned. “But you know ca- 
dets. You were one yourself. I 
supose it’d be as difficult to stop 
cadets from tagging their teach- 
ers with nicknames as it’d be to 
ride a star bareback.” 

Reilly sighed, and swiveled his 
chair until he could see through 
the one cluttered window. The 
parade ground stretched away 
beneath, the system pennant flut- 
tered briskly in the stiff breeze. 
Into his view marched a bat- 
talion of Cadets. Much the same 
scene had repeated itself daily 
during the thirty years he had 
occupied the office. “The faces 
change.” 

“Sir?” 

“The faces change. Sergeant. 
How many thousands of boys 
have come through these doors? 
The uniform never changes, 
though. And I suppose that’s 
really the most important thing. 



66

in its essence — the uniform and 
the tradition.” 

“That it is, sir.” 

Reilly chuckled. “You know, 
Sergeant, I never considered my- 
self a particularly sentimental 
man. Still, the faster the years fly 
by, the dearer old memories be- 
come. The clearer, too. I can re- 
call things that happened when I 
was a boy much easier than I 
can remember what I had for 
breakfast this morning.' And I 
know that’s a sign of old age.” 

He picked up his coffee and 
made a face when he found it 
cold. “Sergeant, as two old men 
sharing the past, how about hav- 
ing a cup of something a bit 
stronger than this watery brew 
with me?” 

“Sir! I really don’t think . .” 
“Oh, bother regulations. Ser- 
geant! I’m speaking as a man 
now, not as a general. I’d deem 
it an honor.” 

“Then I’d be proud to, sir.” 

TTE sat down in the visitor’s 
chair while Reilly opened 
the bottom drawer of his desk 
and drew out a bottle and two 
very dusty glasses. He blew into 
them, set them on the edge of 
the desk and poured generous 
measures of the amber liquid. 
The sergeant accepted his with 
a bow of his head. They raised 
their glasses. 

“To yesterday. Sergeant.” 



“To yesterday, sir. And may 
these days be as memorable to 
those who will be remembering 
fifty years from now.” 

“And those days fifty years 
further.” They touched glasses, 
then tossed off the contents, 
wincing as the whiskey cut its 
way down. A soft ball of fire ex- 
ploded in Reilly’s midsection. He 
sighed, capped the bottle and 
stowed it and the glasses away. 

A short rat-a-tat-tat sounded 
on the door; the Cadet Sergeant- 
Major opened it and stuck his 
head through. “Sir?” 

“Yes, Sergeant?” 

“Six gentlemen to see you, 
sir.” 

“What?” He glanced at his 
memo pad. A notation warned 
him six prospective cadets were 
due to come in. It was not stand- 
ard procedure for him to inter- 
view candidates, but all six were 
the sons of Academy graduates 
killed in the line of duty. “Give 
me five minutes. Sergeant, then 
show them in.” 

“Very good, sir.” He withdrew 
and closed the door. 

“Well, Sergeant,” said Reilly, 
turning to the regular service 
man. “Perhaps these are the lads 
who will be doing that reminis- 
cing fifty years from now.” 

“Quite possible, sir.” He stood 
up and came to attention. “Do I 
have the general’s permission, 
sir?” 



68 



GALAXY 



“Dismissed, Sergeant.” 

Sighing, Reilly swiveled his 
chair again and watched the dril- 
lers on the parade ground until 
the short rat-a-tat-tat sounded 
again. He turned around in time 
to face the gangling teenagers 
trooping through the door. 

“Messrs. Whyte, Phillips, Gar- 
rett, Gordon, Kaslov and Poirot, 
sir,” announced the Cadet Ser- 
geant-Major before withdrawing 
again. 

“Come in, gentlemen, come 
in.” Reilly stood up. “Find your- 
selves a seat. Just pile those 
magazines on the chair, sir. I 
think three of you will fit admir- 
ably on that couch. You others 
can draw up those chairs by the 
water cooler. Yes, that’s it.” He 
shook hands all around, and then 
sat down again. 

“Now then, your names once 
more, please?” He fixed them 
firmly in his mind as each boy 
introduced himself in turn. “Ah, 
yes. And I, of course, am General 
Reilly, Commandant of the 
Academy.” 

“Sir?” 

“Yes, Mr. Kaslov?” 

‘Would that be the General 
Reilly? Of the Deneb Crisis?” 

“I ’see my fame has proceeded 
me, gentlemen. Yes, I am that 
Reilly. Please, don’t let the fact 
scare you. I assure you, I don’t 
bite off the head of a boy until 
he is in uniform. Then, gentle- 



men, you are fair game from then 
on. 

“Now, then,” he said. “Are 
there many other questions be- 
fore I give you my sales pitch? 
Yes, Mr. Kaslov?” 

“Sir,” the boy said, hesitantly, 
“I believe you knew my grand- 
father. Sub-Colonel Kaslov? He 
served with you during the 
Deneb Crisis.” 

“Of course!” said Reilly. “Mar- 
tin Kaslov; I should have recog- 
nized the name immediately. He 
was my Team leader. And his 
son was fresh out of the Acad- 
emy; I remember very well. So 
you might become third genera- 
tion Academy material, eh? 
Good, good. We’re always glad 
to have someone whose roots 
are deep in Academy tradition. 
That’s why I’m particularly hap- 
py to have all six of you gentle- 
men here this afternoon. I under- 
stand you attended my lecture?” 

A ll six nodded; one raised his 
hand. 

“Yes, Mr. Whyte?” 

“Sir, I heard your lecture, but, 
frankly, I didn’t get very much 
out of it. I mean, you talked 
a great deal about the service 
and so forth, but it just didn’t 
make much sense to me. It 
was just like Pop — my dad 
used to talk when I was a kid. I 
don’t suppose it made much 
sense then, but kids don’t under-

stand anyway. But now I’m old 
enough to enter the Academy 
myself. I think I should know 
more about it, what it means, 
what it stands for. Uh, do I make 
myself clear?” 

“As lucid as a mountain spring 
on a bright morning, Mr. Wh5rte. 
I only regret my own words were 
not as concise.” He smiled. The 
other boys laughed while Whyte 
flushed. 

“But you have expressed a 
very important point,” continued 
Reilly. “I don’t want a man 
coming in here who doesn’t know 
what the Academy stands for. 
We have a long tradition, but we 
niean more than just words 
carved over a marble arch. ‘The 
Greater Good for the Greater 
Number.’ There are hundreds of 
years and hundreds of thousands 
of lives lived and died behind 
those seven words. From Earth’s 
first colony in the Centauri sys- 
tem to the latest native intelli- 
gence charted in the Crab Neb- 
ula, those seven words have 
wrapped up an entire philosophy 
and dictated the means of livine 
by it. 

“But what do the words actu- 
ally mean? I think, Mr. Whyte, 
that is the crux of your question. 
Indeed, that is the crux of the 
structure on which the Academy 
is founded. Oh, it’s easy to say 
that the words mean what they 
say, because they do. That and 



no more. But how to explain 
them so that someone who does- 
n’t know will know? In a sense, 
I’ve been trying to do that ever 
since my first girl friend threw 
me over as an incurable romantic 
when she learned that I intended 
to enter the Academy. For many 
people, I’m afraid there is no ex- 
planation. They are incapable of 
understanding, no matter how 
hard we try. But I don’t think 
you gentlemen are in that class. 
Otherwise you would not be here 
at all. 

“The obvious place to begin is 
the beginning. ‘The greater good.’ 
Not the greatest, mind you — the 
greater. There are those who 
quibble over words; they are 
responsible for this particular 
delineation. It would be idealistic 
to try for the greatest in all 
things. Despite his thousands of 
years of development, man is still 
a long ways from being an ideal 
creature. There are certain things 
that remain beyond his capabili- 
ties. In certain isolated incidents, 
the course we follow does pro- 
duce the greatest good possible. 
But they are isolated. 

“The same reasoning follows 
the choice of ‘The Greater Num- 
ber.’ Only our limitations prevent 
us from seeing to it that every 
world in the galaxy is the best of 
all possible worlds, insofar as the 
peculiarities of a particular world 
permit. We do our best, and take 



pride in the fact that that best is 
better than anyone else’s. 

“But so much for numerical 
values. You most want to hear 
what we do. And that can best be 
summed up in one word: every- 
thing, Everything, and yet that, 
too, has its limitations. Impossi- 
bilities are beyond even us. Im- 
probabilities are given a fair 
chance. We are constantly seek- 
ing out courses of action that 
will benefit not the individual 
but the race. And in some in- 
stances, not even a race, when 
there are many races involved 
in a particular manner. The 
methods we follow, the actions 
we take in a particular instance, 
may sometimes seem cruel and 
unreasoning ...”

T he families were on the 
move, away from their com- 
fortable homes under the ever- 
lasting warmth of the sun. Luke 
Royceton^ shifted his weight in 
the copter and trained the glasses 
on a column of dust rising three 
miles to the west and ten thou- 
sand feet below. 

“It’s okay, Harry,” he said to 
the pilot. “They’ve swung back 
north again.” 

“Right, Luke,” the pilot re- 
plied. “Scout report just in says 
there’s a real big outfit about 
eighty miles settling down

around a lake. Shall we hit 
them?” 

“We the closest?” 

“Singer’s forty miles the other 
side of them, but he’s tied up 
chasing some mavericks.” 

“Let’s go then.” 

Luke bolstered his glasses and 
slid down into the cargo hold. 
The rest of the team were taking 
advantage of the lull in activity 
to catch up on their relaxation. 
They had been constantly on the 
go since the migrations had be- 
gun in earnest two months ear- 
lier. Luke kibitzed a card game 
for a few minutes, then an- 
nounced: “Action coming up in 
about twenty minutes. Grab 
something to eat and run a 
check on your costumes.” 

The copter dropped to tree- 
top level five miles from the lake 
and came to ground four miles 
further on. The team piled out, 
stretched the tensions of the long 
j*ide out of their bodies, then 
started out through head-high 
dwarf trees that separated their 
landing spot from the lake. They 
wound through the trees and 
over a low, rolling series of hills. 
The cover stopped suddenly, two 
hundred yards from the beach. 

“Big family is right!” said Luke 
softly, gripping his axe. 

There were nearly fifty huts 
in various stages of construction 
along the beach. Twice that num- 
ber of adult males were working 



70 



GALAXY 



71 



on them, while the women were 
bringing in armloads of grass for 
thatching. The children were 
waist-deep in the lake with fish- 
ing spears. A still wriggling pile 
on the beach testified to their 
prowess. 

Luke glanced over the dozen 
members of his team, shaking 
his head. “I don’t know,” he said. 
“Those are pretty hefty odds.” 
“What’s to worry about, 
Luke?” asked one of the men. 
“You don’t expect those charac- 
ters to put up a fight, do you?” 
“God only knows. They just 
might take it in their heads to do 
that. From looks of things, either 
this outfit has been traveling far 
or else several villages have com- 
bined forces. If it’s the last, then 
I’m plenty worried.” 

“So what do we do? Go back 
and yell for reinforcements?” 
“Not yet. Not until we try 
these babies ourselves. Every- 
body got his courage screwed 
up?” There were soft murmurs of 
assent from each man. “Make 
torches.” Two men faded away 
and returned a moment later 
with arms full of the same grass 
the villagers were using. Half the 
team set to work, twisting them 
into torches and tying them with 
short lengths of a twine-like vine 
they had brought along from the 
equatorial jungles. The torches 
were passed out, and Luke took 
a deep breath: “Let’s go!” 



'T^HE team leaped to their feet 
and broke from the cover, 
screaming their banshee cry. The 
natives dropped what they were 
doing and wheeled around, then 
froze in their tracks at the sight 
of the wildly painted devils tear- 
ing down the beach. The two 
hundred yards separating them 
halved, then halved again before 
the natives broke out of their 
stupor. One of the workers placed 
his fingers between his teeth and 
whistled. The children ran in 
from the lake, tossing their 
spears to the nearest adult, man 
or woman. 

By the time the team was 
among them, axes whistling 
through the air and smashing the 
walls of the huts, the villagers 
were armed and fighting back. 

“We’ve got troubles!” yelled 
Luke, bringing his axe down to 
break several spears being jab- 
bed at him. The spears were too 
short to make good throwing 
weapons, so the natives were 
using them just as they would in 
going after fish. One got through 
Luke’s guard; he choked back a 
cry of pain as the broad stone 
head went into his flesh and was 
twisted. He pulled away, yanking 
the shaft out of the native’s hand. 

Two of the team had managed 
to get close enough to the cook- 
ing fires to light their torches. 
They used them now as shields, 
until the grass burned down to

the handles. One then tossed his 
into the large pile of thatching 
material, while the other stuck 
his into the unplastered wall of 
the nearest hut. The thatching 
blazed up quickly, forcing the 
natives away from the heat. Most 
of the team now had their backs 
to the nearest wall; none had es- 
caped the jabbing spears. One 
man was completely encircled by 
the natives. Suddenly his axe was 
wrenched from his grasp. They 
picked him up, legs flailing wild- 
ly in the air, carried him over and 
threw him onto the fire. 

“Let’s get out of here!” scream- 
med Luke, surprising those 
around him by suddenly leaping 
forward and grabbing two of 
them, forcing them off balance. 
He called on every ounce of 
strength he possessed to run 
through the gauntlet of spears. 
From the corner of his eye, he 
could see one other man break 
loose, only to be recaptured a 
dozen feet farther on. 

By some miracle, Luke out- 
distanced those pursuing him, 
crashing into the cover. The na- 
tives followed a few yards, then 
gave up the chase, heading back 
to the easier sport on the beach. 

Luke tripped over an exposed 
root and crashed to the ground. 
He tried to get up again, but his 
injured arm refused to support 
him. Closing his eyes, he waited 
for the fatal blow to fall. 



Several minutes passed, dur- 
ing which Luke recited every 
prayer he had ever heard, to 
every conceivable deity in the 
pantheon. At the end of that 
time! he realized that he wasn’t 
going to die after all — at least, 
not here and now. Rolling over 
onto his good arm, he sat up and 
got his back against a tree. From 
the beach came screams of terror, 
growing fainter as he listened 
and finally dying away alto- 
gether. Bracing his good arm 
against a tree, he worked himself 
up, got himself oriented and 
started back towards the copter. 

The pilot threw away his ciga- 
rette and dropped out of the door 
to the cargo hold when Luke 
came limping into view. 

“My God, man! What hap- 
pened?” 

“I . made a mistake.” He let 
himself be helped into the copter 
and took the mike, reporting the 
disaster on the beach to the Com- 
mandant back at Base. Then he 
let the pilot bandage his wounds. 

Ci'C'LEVEN men dead,” he 
said bitterly. 

“Don’t take it so hard, Luke,” 
said Andy Singer. The team 
Commanders were back in the 
debriefing room again. All had 
commiserated with Luke on the 
tragedy; none had been able to 
convince him that it had not 
been his fault.

“Eleven men dead,” he re- 
peated, no matter what they said. 

The commandant came in and 
they rose. “At ease, gentlemen,” 
he said, as he mounted the plat- 
form. He stared at them for a 
thirty-second eternity. 

“Ours is not an easy task.” His 
words broke the tension; all 
sighed. 

“There has been a tragic acci- 
dent, gentlemen. Good men have 
died. Men just as good have died 
on a thousand planets in a thou- 
sand different ways. Sometimes 
they died because of an error; 
sometimes the death was un- 
avoidable. But for whatever rea- 
son, they did not die in vain! 

“This is a young planet,” he 
continued. “In many ways, it’s as 
near to paradise as any of us will 
ever see. Man is a young race 
here — young in development. 
Yet almost before he has a 
chance to prove himself, he has 
found himself in a backwater, 
stymied as it were by the very 
paradise qualities which attract 
us. Life is easy here, too easy. He 
doesn’t have to exert himself. He 
lives much like his ancestors did, 
ten thousand years ago. 

“There is no future in standing 
still. Whether he likes it or not, 
man must develop, must give the 
future generations a chance for 
their place in the sun. Despite 
sentimentality, anything that 
gives them that chance is good. 



Therefore, I repeat: eleven men 
died here yesterday. They did 
not die in vain!” 

“Time for a break, I think,” 
said Reilly, pressing a button. 
The door opened and the cadet 
Sergeant-Major stuck his head 
in. 

“Sir?” 

“Coffee, Sergeant. That will be 
suitable, gentlemen?” The boys 
nodded and the cadet withdrew. 

“While we’re waiting, are there 
any more questions?” 

One of the boys hesitantly 
raised his hand. 

“Mr. Phillips?” 

“Sir, why is so much of the 
activity by the agents carried out 
in secrecy? It all seems rather 
underhanded to me.” 

“By the very nature of them- 
selves, what we do must be car- 
ried out secretly. Even when we 
act openly, it is in secret . .” 

I N the distance a bell tolled the 
supper hour. In the palace, 
pageboys wandered the corridors, 
knocking on apartment doors 
rousing the occupants. Carter 
combed out his beard, frowning 
at the liberal sprinkling of gray 
hairs in it, donned his cloak and 
set out for the dining hall. He 
shivered as a chill wind swept 
down the drafty corridors, and 
reminded himself to speak to 
Kahl again about returning to

the capital city. Anything would 
be better than this. 

The dining hall was crowded, 
as usual, with supplicants who 
had bribed their way to the royal 
tables. Most of them had wasted 
their money. The chamberlain 
had stuck them away in far cor- 
ners where they would be able 
to do nothing but stare at the 
man they wanted to see. Not that 
it would have done them any 
good to speak to the king. Kahl 
found the petty details of his 
office tiring. More and more he 
had been shoving them onto the 
willing shoulders of Carter. 

The chamberlain met him at 
the door with a copy of the seat- 
ing arrangements. Carter read 
down the list, pausing here and 
there at familiar names — most 
of them p>ests who had long ago 
worn out his patience. He pursed 
his lips and touched a name with 
his finger. 

“This Ivra. Fisherman, it says. 
He the one with the daughter 
Kahl wants?” 

“Yes.” Like most of the royal 
retinue, the chamberlain was un- 
comfortable in Carter’s presence. 
The man had no title, no office. 
But he was undeniably the most 
powerful person in the realm 
after the king himself — some 
placed his ^eminence even ahead 
of the king’s. “Shall I place him 
at the royal table?” 

“No. It wouldn’t do any good. 



But tell him to come see me 
tomorrow — no. Make that three 
days from now. He can’t have his 
daughter unviolated, but I think 
we can make him happy to have 
her at all.” 

He handed the list back and 
made his way to the royal table, 
nodding to acquaintances and 
enemies. The problem of the fish- 
erman bothered him. Carter was 
unaware of the fact, but he car- 
ried a strong puritanical con- 
science, the legacy of unknown 
forebears of years back. He dis- 
approved of Kahl’s unrestrained 
love life and did whatever he 
could to ease the disruptions it 
caused in the normal flow of sub- 
ject-ruler relations. 

He stopped at the royal table 
and clapped a uniformed officer 
on the shoulder. “Marshal Zants! 
A pleasure to see you back at 
court. I read your report. I know 
His Most Graciousness will be 
pleased at your eastern suc- 
cesses.” 

“Thank you, sir.” The marshal 
inclined his head. “And I see you 
have had your own successes. 
Much has changed during the 
two years of my campaign.” 

“We all live. Marshal,” said 
Carter. “We all grow a little older. 
It’s the natural course of life. A 
man who stands still in one posi- 
tion all the time wouldn’t make a 
good runner, now would he?” 

“Indeed not. I suppose you 

GALAXY 



wouldn’t be interested in a com- 
mission under me? What things 
we could do together!” 

“I’m honored that you think of 
me so kindly, but I’m afraid my 
peculiar talents don’t run in the 
military manner. Marshal.” 

“Ah, but what a strategist you 
would make, sir.” 

“Oh?” He grinned. “Then our 
enemies should be happy to have 
me in the capital, not on the 
field.” 

H e reached his seat just in 
time to touch trousers to it 
and rise again when Kahl came 
in, whispering something in the 
ear of a courtesan. The girl 
laughed hysterically, then went 
to the woman’s table as servants 
started bringing in the first 
course. Kahl grunted as he sat 
down and rubbed his belly. He 
leaned over towards Carter. 

“I’m getting fat, southerner. 
Fat and old.” 

“A little exercise would do us 
all good.” 

Kahl laughed. “That’s what I 
like about you. Carter. Not for 
you the mealy-mouthed compli- 
ments. When you think some- 
thing, you come right out and 
say it. I wish more of my minis- 
ters had your courage.” 

“A few tried it,” said Carter. 
“As I remember it, you had their 
ears cut off and made them eat 
them.” 

THE PROBLEM MAKERS 



“Yes, but I gave them a choice 
as to how they were prepared, 
didn’t I?” He roared, and the rest 
of the room roared with him, al- 
though no one more than six feet 
from the head of the royal table 
could possibly have known the 
jest. 

Kahl fell to slurping his soup, 
while Carter did his best to hide 
his distaste at the man’s table 
manners. For that matter, there 
was not a person in the hall he 
would have invited to the most 
informal dinner in his own apart- 
ments. Table manners were 
something else he had been try- 
ing to introduce, but as yet they 
were his most notorious failure. 

“Ahhh!” The king wiped his 
mouth with the back of his hand. 
While one servant removed the 
soup and another brought up the 
platter of meats and fish, he 
leaned over again. “Now, then, 
Carter. I’ve been meaning to 
speak to you all day. Been busy, 
though. Inhuman the number of 
demands on my time. Not that 
I mind of course. The penalties 
of the crown, and all that. But I 
really have been meaning to talk 
to you. How’s that pet tinkerer of 
yours coming along.” 

“Which one would that be? 
I’ve got most of the college work- 
ing, you know.” 

“The one working on that 
steam gadget you’ve been telling 
me about. You know, the one to 



76 



77 



make work easier. Not that I can 
see why a man should have his 
work made easy. Does the people 
good to sweat a bit.” 

“Economically, though, to 
have one man able to do the 
work of half a dozen is very good. 
Just think of how it’ll enrich the 
treasuries. Besides, the work isn’t 
any easier on them: they just 
produce more.” 

“Yes, yes. You’ve explained 
that all before. But how is it 
going?” 

“Quite well. I think another 
few weeks will bring very prom- 
ising results. Some of the others 
are coming along well, too. The 
armory is turning out a hundred 
of the improved crossbows a day, 
now. I took Marshal Zants 
through the armory and his eyes 
positively glowed with excite- 
ment. He promises new and 
greater victories in his next cam- 
paign.” 

Kahl was chewing on 
the leg of a bird. “He’s 
been doing pretty good as it is, 
hasn’t he?” 

“Much better than I would 
have thought,” Carter admitted. 
“The problems of waging a war 
completely off from contact with 
home are great. Lines of supply, 
communication — these are all 
vital to the successful campaign. 
I’ve got a few ideas on these sub- 
jects, too. After all, there is a 



limit to how much may be with- 
drawn from an occupied area — - 
if you still want to have that area 
useful to you in the future. A 
very wise man in my country 
once said that an army travels on 
its stomach. The plans Zants has 
been discussing with me for his 
next campaign call for a very 
large army.” 

“You know,” said Kahl, “at the 
rate we’re going, it won’t be long 
before your country is part of my 
country.” 

“I’m afraid that’ll take a while 
yet.” He laughed. “Although 
there has never been a nation in 
history with so much territory 
under its direct rule. Your name 
will live as the monarch of this 
country alone, no matter what 
you might do on your own.” 

Events were moving fast on 
the planet — almost faster than 
Carter wanted. Already the lands 
under Kahl’s rule amounted to 
nearly fifty per cent of the known 
areas of the world. At the rate 
things were snowballing, it 
wouldn’t be long before his pri- 
mary objective of planetary uni- 
fication were achieved — thou- 
sands of years ahead of time, if 
events had been permitted to fol- 
low their natural course. 

Of course, there would be de- 
lays and setbacks all along the 
way. Subsidiary objectives would 
always be getting in the way, 
must always be considered along 



78 



GALAXY 



with other plans. But even so, 
things were off to a good start. 
Although he might not live to 
see the complete fruition of all 
of his plans. Carter knew that 
this world was well on its way 
towards galactic citizenship. 

“There’s a great deal of satis- 
faction in being a power behind 
the throne.” Reilly grinned. 
“However, if any of you have a 
particular yen toward such 
power, it’s only fair to tell you 
now that our screening is the 
most thorough ever devised. And 
it is constantly being improved. 
No man is ever placed in a posi- 
tion where his weaknesses might 
prove the better of him. 

“This is not to say that a man 
might not find himself in a posi- 
tion where he will be called on 
to do more than his utmost. It’s 
surprising just how much a man 
can do, when he finds out he has 
no other choice . .”

t^HE counterfeit Lund reached 
the bank of elevators a half- 
dozen running paces ahead of the 
just-coming-to-life audience. He 
gestured, and the operator closed 
the door in their faces. 

During the long descent to the 
street, Lund stripped off his 
clothes and did things to his face 
while the operator shoved the 



discarded costume into an access 
panel. Then he gave the now-slim 
little man a boost up through the 
roof of the cage and let himself 
be helped up. 

“Thank God for tradition,” the 
man who had been known as 
Lund said when he helped the 
other man up. Stripping off his 
uniform jacket and reversing it 
changed the other’s appearance. 
The elevator slowed automati- 
cally for the ground floor. Word 
had been flashed down from the 
Conference hall, but when the 
waiting monitors surged into the 
opening elevator before it had 
quite eased to a stop, they found 
nothing at all. 

Overhead, the two men 
threaded their way through a 
maze of cables and onto the roof 
of the next cab. It dropped under 
them, then stopped halfway be- 
tween floors while they climbed 
down. The new operator eyed 
them, but said nothing while they 
brushed each other off. At a sig- 
nal from the small man, the cab 
continued its interrupted drop, 
letting them out on the sub- 
surface shopping level. 

The corridors of the level were 
full of running figures, most of 
them heading towards the eleva- 
tor banks. No one paid the newly 
arrived pair any attention at all, 
although the powder-blue uni- 
forms of the monitors predom- 
inated.

The two men strode briskly 
down the corridor until they 
came to a side passage lined with 
small shops that featured the 
specialized products of the vari- 
ous members of the Conference. 
They stopped in front of one dis- 
playing gadgets from Ehrla, then 
entered while the counterfeit 
Lund purchased a perpetual 
razor, having it giftwrapped. 
Then they wandered further, act- 
ing now like the average sight- 
seer, until they reached a florist’s 
shop set in an alcove at the end 
of the passage. 

They entered, saw that there 
were no other customers, nodded 
to the salesman and continued on 
to the back. 

“Dale!” The waiting pair 
leaped to their feet and spoke as 
one. “We thought you weren’t 
going to make it!” 

“I didn’t think so myself,” said 
Dale Vernon, the slim little man. 
“If Die hadn’t been there right on 
schedule, there’d be nothing left 
of me but a few bloody shreds. 
Those people were mad!” His 
voice showed respect for the 
strength of their emotions, 
“What’s the news?” 

“The Park monitors found the 
real Lund about twenty minutes 
ago.” 

“Good timing. Any sooner, and 
the fun upstairs would have been 
different.” 

“And you know who is scream- 



ing for the dissolving of the Con- 
ference." 

“So soon?” 

“They, uh, you might say had 
an inside lead as to what was 
going to happen.” 

“It’s a little early to tell," 
added the other man, “but ap- 
parently the operation was a suc- 
cess. The proper wheels have 
been set in motion, at least. We’ll 
have to keep applying grease 
from time to time in the next 
forty-eight hours, but I think we 
can forget about the Ehrlan 
problem — during this confer- 
ence, at least. Ten years from 
now, they’ll have an entirely dif- 
ferent set of plans for the refor- 
mation of the galaxy. And we’ll 
have to come up with an entirely 
different way of crossing them.” 

“Do-gooders!” snorted the first 
man. 

“You must admit, they have 
the best of intentions,” said 
Vernon. 

“But intentions aren’t enough,” 
added the other. “Man is an im- 
perfect creature at best, and his 
best is a rare occurence indeed. 
We have to deal with practicali- 
ties. Perfection is beyond us, and 
we’d be idiots to try and enforce 
it. That’s the basic difference be- 
tween us and the Ehrlans — we 
know what we can and can’t do. 
They know only what they 
would like to do. And that makes

them the most dangerous force 
loose in the galaxy today.” 

sum it up,” said Reilly, 
^ getting up and going to 
the window, “ours is not a life of 
glory and fame.” Another bat- 
talion marched out onto the field 
below and began the familiar 
maneuvers. “We work hard and 
receive little thanks — if, indeed, 
we receive any thanks at all. The 
life is strenuous. The work is de- 
manding. And over all of us rides 



the constant specter of failure, 
for we are not perfect. Nor do we 
want to be. 

“It is a lonely life for some: it 
is a short life for others. But for 
all of us, it’s something more.” 
He turned and faced the boys 
again. “It is the chance to be 
something more than just a man, 
for a man is a selfish creature. 
And it is the most rewarding life 
I know. 

“Any questions, gentlemen?”

BY WILLY LEY 



rpHE AVERAGE reader — as 
-*■ distinct from the science-fic- 
tion reader — has had a number 
of terminology problems during 
the past few years. His favorite 
newspapers and magazines, in- 
stead of talking about things one 
could understand like sad-eyed 
puppies and clean-cut little boys 
who, unfortunately, are too stupid 
to spell properly, has started talk- 
ing of orbits, perigee and apogee, 
inclination to the equator and 
similar things. Quite a number of 



people are convinced that these 
are all brand new words, invented 
either in Washington or in Hunts- 
ville, Alabama. In reality they are 
standard astronomical terms that 
have been around since the early 
part of the seventeenth century. 

But recently talk about L- 
points has started and though 
this, too, is a standard astronomi- 
cal term, I suspect that not even 
all science-fiction readers are 
quite sure just what an L-point is. 

To begin at the beginning, the 
L stands for Lagrange, full name 
Joseph Louis Lagrange, who lived 
from 1736 to 1813. Lagrange was 
a mathematician with strong 
astronomical leanings, and as his 
name indicates he was a French- 
man. Frenchmen have the repu- 
tation of being people who stay 
home, or at least in France. If this 
is truly a national characteristic 
of the French, then Lagrange was 
an atypical Frenchman. To begin 
with, he was born in Torino, or 
Turin, in Italy and was educated 
there; he also had his first posi- 
tion in Italy, being appointed (at 
the age of nineteen!) professor of 
mathematics at the Artillery 
School at Torino. While engaged 
in the task of hammering some 
mathematics into the skulls of fu- 
ture artillery commanders he cor- 
responded with the mathemati- 
cian Leonhard Euler and laid the 
foundation for the branch of 
mathematics which later came to 



be called calculus of variations. 

At the age of 28 he published a 
mathematical treatise on the mo- 
tion of the moon which was 
awarded a prize by the French 
Academy of Sciences. Two years 
later, he followed up with a the- 
ory of the motions of the satel- 
lites of Jupiter which made such 
an impression in Berlin that Fred- 
erick the Great of Prussia ap>- 
pointed him director of the Berlin 
Academy of Sciences. Lagrange 
sp)ent the next twenty years of 
his life in Berlin until, finally, in 
1787 Louis XVI of France in- 
vited him to come to Paris. There 
he sp>ent the rest of his life, head- 
ing a commission for the reform 
of weights and measures, being 
professor at the Ecole Polytech- 
nique and finally becoming a sen- 
ator and elevated to Count by 
Nap>oleon I. 

During his investigation of the 
orbits of our own moon, as well 
as the orbits of Jupiter’s satellites, 
Lagrange encountered a problem 
which he did not solve: the so- 
called three-body problem. 

rpHE PROBLEM is very sim- 
ply this : 

Assume three bodies in space 
— say a planet which has two 
very large moons in orbit around 
it. You know the mass of every 
one of these three bodies. You 
also know their relative p>ositions, 
and you know their orbital veloci-

ties at this moment. Now find a 
set of simple and elegant equa- 
tions which permit you to predict 
the future motions of these bodies, 
accounting for their mutual at- 
tractions all the time. 

Lagrange tried hard, but failed; 
and to this day nobody has been 
able to come up with such a set 
of equations. 

Of course we can and do calcu- 
late such cases — for example, 
when it comes to predicting the 
motion of a comet. But it has to 
be done by way of endless step- 



by-step calculations which have 
to be checked against observa- 
tions all the time. 

But, while Lagrange failed to 
find an overall solution of the 
three-body problem, he did find 
a number of special cases where 
there was a solution, provided the 
bodies were in certain relative po- 
sitions to each other. In fact, there 
were five such p>ositions . which 
later were called the Lagrangian 
points, or L-points, 

For an example of the Lagran- 
gian points let us look at the 



84 



GALAXY 




earth-moon system. (Fig. 1.) The 
earth and the moon are two of 
the three bodies. The third one 
would be a hypothetical satellite; 
and the problem would be to find 
a position in which it would have 
an easily predictable orbit. Two 
of these points are the ones 
known as equilaterals, positions 
L^ and Lr„ where the satellite 
would travel in the orbit of the 
moon and would, of course, have 
the same orbital period as the 
moon. 

But there are two more such 
points which lie on the line con- 
necting the center of the earth 
with the center of the moon. One 
of these two is closer to us than 
the moon; the other is beyond the 
moon. Now, if our moon did not 
exist, a satellite moving at the dis- 
tance of the Li point — about 



203,000 miles from the earth’s 
center — and another satellite 
moving at the distance of the Lo 
point — about 280,000 miles 
from the earth’s center — would 
have different orbital periods. 
The Li satellite would need less 
time than our moon; the Lo satel- 
lite would need more time. But 
because our moon is there the 
satellites in these points would 
have the same orbital period as 
our moon. 

One may try to visualize this 
by imagining that our moon’s 
gravitational force drags the Lj 
satellite along a bit faster than 
it would move normally, and 
keeps the Lj satellite back so 
that it does not move quite as 
fast as it would by itself. 

We now know that the L^ and 
Lr. positions are actually occupied 
by dust clouds. The Li point is 
not occupied, while an occupant 
of the Lo point could never be 
seen from earth. (In the future 
both the Li and Lo points may be 
occupied by radio relay satellites, 
if we get more than one human 
settlement on the moon. Because 
of the fairly strong curvature of 
the moon’s surface, two distant 
lunar bases could not have direct 
radio contact. But they could talk 
to each other easily via relay 
satellites, located in the Ls point 
for bases on the far side of the 
moon, and in the Li point for 
bases on the lunar hemisphere

which is visible from the earth.) 

¥>EFORE I go on, one loose end 
and one possible misunder- 
standing have to be taken care of. 

The possible misunderstanding 
concerns the Li point. Everybody 
knows that, between the earth 
and the moon, there is a “neutral 
point”, a point where the gravita- 
tional fields of earth and moon 
have the same strength. This neu- 
tral point is not the same as the 
Li point. In fact it is closer to the 
moon, roughly 24,000 miles from 
the lunar surface, or about 25,000 
miles from the center of the 
moon. 

As for the “loose end”, as I 
called it, it is the simple question 
“where is L3?” Well, Ls is also on 
the line connecting the earth and 
the moon. But it is on the other 
side of the earth, below the bot- 
tom of our diagram. 

Now, these Lagrangian points 
exist for every planet and its 
moons. They also exist if you con- 
sider the sun and a planet the two 
bodies. In other words, we could 
have equilaterals in the earth’s 
orbit and in any other planetary 
orbit. In the case of Jupiter the 
equilateral points are known to 
be occupied, both the advance 
and the trailing position. 

Quite recently Dr. W. B, Klem- 
perer has done some more work 
on the three-body problem. Like 
Lagrange he failed to find a gen- 




eral solution, but he succeeded in 
extending Lagrange’s special 
cases, which always dealt with 
three bodies — though of course 
all the L-points around one planet 
might be occupied — to special 
cases of many bodies. 

You can have stable systems 
for three, four, five, six, eight and 
so forth bodies. They have to ful- 
fill two conditions: they must or- 
bit in the same plane; and they 
must, at any moment, form a 
regular polygon. Whether there is 
a major mass in the center of 
that polygon or not does not mat- 
ter; the orbits would be stable 
with or without a central mass. 

One such possible arrangement 
is shown in the second diagram. 
Here we have four bodies, orbit- 
ing in the same plane and in ellip- 
tical orbits of the same size and 



86 



GALAXY 



eccentricity. The open circles 
show the four bodies at their ex- 
treme distances from the central 
mass (which needn’t be there) 
and they form a square. Some 
time later, all four bodies have 
moved the same distance along 
their orbits, as indicated by the 
closed circles, and they still form 
a square. This system would be 
stable. So would the five-body 
system shown in Fig. 3. And a 
M-body system, forming a 64- 
comered regular polygon, would 
be stable too. 

I said a short while ago that 
two conditions must be fulfilled: 
the bodies must form a regular 
polygon at any moment and they 
must move in the same plane. Do 
they also have to have equal 
masses, as indicated in the dia- 
grams? 

The answer is that they do not 
have to have equal masses, pro- 
vided another condition is ful- 
filled. If we had a six-body sys- 
tem, forming a regular hexagon, 
the bodies could be of two differ- 
ent masses, but then they would 
need a regular arrangement. The 
larger and the smaller bodies 



would have to alternate. In the 
hexagonal system, bodies 1, 3 and 
5 would have to have the same 
mass and bodies 2, 4 and 6 also 
would have to have the same 
mass. But bodies 1, 3 and 5 could 
be five times as massive as bodies 
2, 4 and 6. 

These interesting arrangements 
would not last if an additional 
body wandered into the system 
from the outside. For this reason 
it is not very likely that such 
systems actually exist. 

But it would be careless to pro- 
claim that they do not exist. 
When Lagrange theoretized equi- 
laterals back in 1772 no actual 
case was known, and because of 
such lack of confirmation in na- 
ture his “points” were very nearly 
forgotten. But then asteroid 1908- 
TG was discovered by Max Wolf 
in February, 1908, and when the 
orbit was computed it was found 
to move in the orbit of Jupiter. 
Its running number and name be- 
came 588-Achilles and it was the 
first equilateral found. 

Maybe a “Klemperer rosette” 
will turn up, tool

npHE PHONE bleeped. North- 
rop nudged the cut-in switch 
and heard Maurillo say, “We got 
a gangrene, chief. They’re ampu- 
tating tonight.” 

Northrop’s pulse quickened at 
the thought of action. ‘What’s 
the tab?” he asked. 

“Five thousand for all rights.” 
“Anesthetic?” 

“Natch,” Maurillo said. “I tried 
it the other way.” 

‘What did you offer?” 

“Ten. It was no go.” 

Northrop sighed. “I’ll have to 
handle it myself, I guess. Where’s 
the patient?” 



“Clinton General. In the 
wards.” 

Northrop raised a heavy eye. 
brow and glowered into the 
screen. “In the wards?” he bel* 
lowed. “And you couldn’t get 
them to agree?” 

Maurillo seemed to shrink. “It 
was the relatives, chief. Thq^ 
were stubborn. The old man, he 
didn’t seem to give a damn, but 
the relatives — ” 

“Okay. You stay there. 
coming over to close the deal,"^ 
Northrop snapped. He cut the 
phone out and pulled a coup^ 
of blank waiver forms out of his 
desk, just in case the relativei| 
backed down. Gangrene was gao* 
grene, but ten grand was ten 



grand. And business was business. 
The networks were yelling. He 
had to supply the goods or get 
out. 

He thumbed the autosecretary. 
“I want my car ready in thirty 
seconds. South Street exit.” 
“Yes, Mr. Northrop.” 

“If anyone calls for me in the 
next half hour, record it, I’m go- 
ing to Clinton General Hospital, 
but I don’t want to be called 
there.” 

“Yes, Mr. Northrop.” 

“If Rayheld calls from the net- 
work office, tell him I’m getting 
him a dandy. Tell him — oh, hell, 
tell him I’ll call him back in an 
hour. That’s all.” 

“Yes, Mr. Northrop,” 

Northrop scowled at the ma- 
chine and left his office. The 
gravshaft took him down forty 
stories in almost literally no time 
flat. His car was waiting, as or- 
dered, a long, sleek ’08 Frontenac 
with bubble top. Bullet-proof, of 
course. Network producers were 
vulnerable to crackpot attacks. 

He sat back, nestling into the 
plush upholstery. The car asked 
him where he was going, and he 
answered. 

“Let’s have a pep pill,” he said. 
A pill rolled out of the dispen- 
ser in front of him. He gulped it 
down. Maurillo, you make me 
sick, he thought. Why can’t you 
close a deal without me? Just 
once? 



He made a mental not^ 
Maurillo had to go. The organi. 
zation couldn’t tolerate ineffi. 
ciency. 

^I^HE HOSPITAL was an ol^ 
'*■ one. It was housed in one of 
the vulgar green-glass architect 
tural monstrosities so populaj 
sixty years before, a tasteless slab- 
sided thing without character or 
grace. 

The main door irised and 
Northrop stepped through. The 
familiar hospital smell hit his 
nostrils. Most people found it un- 
pleasant, but not Northrop. For 
him it was the smell of dollars. 

The hospital was so old that it 
still had nurses and orderlies. Oh, 
plenty of mechanicals skittered 
up and down the corridors, but 
here and there a middle-aged 
nurse, smugly clinging to her ten- 
ure, pushed a tray of mush along, 
or a doddering orderly propelled 
a broom. In his early days on 
video Northrop had done a docu- 
mentary on these living fossils of 
the hospital corridors. He had 
won an award for the film. He 
remembered it for its crosscuts 
from baggy-faced nurses to gleam- 
ing mechanicals, its vivid presen- 
tation of the inhumanity of the 
new hospitals. It was a long time 
since Northrop had done a docu- 
mentary of that sort. A different 
kind of show was the order of the 
day now, ever since the intensi-j

fiers came in and telecasting 
Oiedicine became an art. 

A mechanical took him to 
Ward Seven, Maurillo was wait- 
ing there, a short, bouncy little 
man who wasn’t bouncing much 
now. He knew he had fumbled. 
Maurillo grinned up at Northrop, 
a hollow grin, and said, “You sure 
made it fast, chief!” 

“How long would it take for 
the competition to cut in?” North- 
rop countered. “Where’s the pa- 
tient?” 

“Down by the end. You see 
where the curtain is? I had that 
put up. To get in good with the 
heirs. The relatives, I mean.” 
“Fill me in,” Northrop said. 
“Who’s in charge?” 

“The oldest son, Harry. Watch 
out for him. Greedy.” 

‘Who isn’t?” Northrop sighed. 
They were at the curtain now. 
Maurillo parted it. All through 
the long ward, patients were stir- 
ring. Potential subjects for taping, 
all of them, Northrop thought. 
The world was so full of different 
kinds of sickness — and one sick- 
ness fed on another. 

TTE STEPPED through the cur- 
tain. There was a man in the 
bed, drawn and gaunt, his hollow 
face greenish, stubbly. A mechani- 
cal stood next to the bed, witH an 
intravenous tube running across 
and under the covers. 

The patient looked at least 



ninety. Knocking off ten years for 
the effects of illness still made 
him pretty old, Northrop thought. 

He confronted the relatives. 

There were eight of them. Five 
women, ranging from middle age 
down to teens. Three men, the 
oldest about fifty, the other two 
in their forties. Sons and nieces 
and granddaughters, Northrop fig- 
ured. 

He said gravely, “I know what 
a terrible tragedy this must be 
for all of you. A man in the prime 
of his life — head of a happy 
family — ” Northrop stared at the 
patient. “But I know he’ll pull 
through. I can see the strength in 
him,” 

The oldest relative said, “I’m 
Harry Gardner. I’m his son. 
You’re from the network?” 

“I’m the producer,” Northrop 
said. “I don’t ordinarily come in 
person, but my assistant told me 
what a great human situation 
there was here, what a brave per- 
son your father was — ” 

The man in the bed slept on. 
He looked bad. 

Harry Gardner said, “We made 
an arrangement. Five thousand 
bucks. We wouldn’t do it, except 
for the hospital bills. They can 
really wreck you,” 

“I understand perfectly,” Nor- 
throp said in his most unctuous 
tones. “That’s why we’re pre- 
pared to raise our offer. We’re 
well aware of the disastrous ef- 



THE PAIN PEDDLERS

fects of hospitalization on a 
small family, even today, in these 
times of protection. And so we 
can offer — ” 

“No! There’s got to be anes- 
thetic!” It was one of the daugh- 
ters, a round, drab woman with 
colorless thin lips. “We ain’t go- 
ing to let you make him suffer!” 

Northrop smiled. “It would 
only be a moment of pain for 
him. Believe me. We’d begin the 
anesthesia immediately after the 
amputation. Just let us capture 
that single instant of — ” 

“It ain’t right! He’s old, he’s 
got to be given the best treat- 
ment! The pain could kill him!” 

“On the contrary,” Northrop 
said blandly. “Scientific research 
has shown that pain is often ben- 
eficial in amputation cases. It 
creates a nerve block, you see, 
that causes a kind of anesthesia 
of its own, without the harmful 
side effects of chemotherapy. 
And once the danger vectors are 
controlled, the normal anesthetic 
procedures can be invoked, and 
— ” he took a deep breath, and 
went rolling glibly on to the 
crusher — “with the extra fee we‘Il 
provide, you can give your dear 
one the absolute finest in medical 
care. There’ll be no reason to 
stint.” 

Vj^ARY glances were ex- 
changed. Harry Gardner 
said, “How much are you offer- 



ing for this absolute finest in 
medical care?” 

“May I see the leg?" Northrop 
answered. 

The coverlet was peeled back. 
Northrop stared. 

It was a nasty case. Northrop 
was no doctor, but he had been 
in this line of work for five years, 
and that was long enough to give 
him an amateur acquaintance 
with disease. He knew the old 
man was in bad shape. It looked 
as though there had been a severe 
bum, high up along the calf, 
which had probably been treated 
only with first aid. Then, in happy 
proletarian ignorance, the family 
had let the old man rot until he' 
was gangrenous. Now the leg 
was blackened, glossy, and swol- 
len from mid-calf to the ends of 
the toes. Everything looked soft 
and decayed. Northrop had the 
feeling that he could reach out 
and break the puffy toes off, one 
at a time. 

The patient wasn’t going to 
survive. 

Amputation or not, he was rot- 
ten to the core by this time. If the 
shock of amputation didn’t do 
him in, general debilitation would. 
It was a good prospect for the 
show. It was the kind of stomach- 
turning vicarious suffering that 
millions of viewers gobbled up 
avidly. 

Northrop looked up and said, 
“Fifteen thousand if you’ll allow 




a network-approved surgeon to 
amputate under our conditions. 
And we’ll pay the surgeon’s fee 
besides.” 

“Well — ” 

“And we’ll also underwrite the 
entire cost of post-operative care 
for your father,” Northrop added 
smoothly. “Even if he stays in 
the hospital for six months, we’ll 
pay every nickel, over and above 
the telecast fee.” 

H e had them. He could see 
the greed shining in their 
eyes. They were faced with bank- 
ruptcy. He had come to rescue 
them; and did it matter all that 
much if the old man didn’t have 
anesthetic when they sawed his 
leg off? Why, he was hardly con- 
scious even now. He wouldn’t 
really feel a thing. Not really. 

Northrop produced the docu- 
ments, the waivers, the contracts 
covering residuals and Latin- 
American re-runs, the payment 
vouchers, all the paraphernalia. 
He sent Maurillo scuttling off for 
a secretary, and a few moments 
later a glistening mechanical was 
taking it all down. 

“If you’ll put your name here, 
Mr. Gardner — ” 

Northrop handed the pen to 
the eldest son. Signed, sealed, de- 
livered. 

“We’ll operate tonight,” North- 
said. “I’ll send our surgeon over 
immediately. One of our best 



men. We’ll give your father the 
care he deserves.” 

He pocketed the documents. 

It was done. Maybe it was bar- 
baric to operate on an old man 
that way, Northrop thought. But- 
he didn’t bear the responsibility, 
after all. He was just giving the 
public what it wanted. What the 
public wanted was spouting blood 
and tortured nerves. 

And what did it matter to the 
old man, really? Any experienced 
medic could tell you he was as 
good as dead. The operation 
wouldn’t save him. Anesthesia 
wouldn’t save him. If the gan- 
grene didn’t get him, pKJSt-opera- 
tive shock would do him in. At 
worst, he would suffer only a 
few minutes under the knife . 
but at least his family would be 
free from the fear of financial 
ruin. 

On the way out, Maurillo said, 
“Don’t you think it’s a little risky, 
chief? Offering to pay the hospi- 
talization expenses, I mean?” 
“You’ve got to gamble a little 
sometimes to get what you want,” 
Northrop said. 

“Yeah, but that could run to 
fifty, sixty thousand! What’ll that 
do to the budget?” 

Northrop grinned. “We’ll sur- 
vive. Which is more than the old 
man will. He can’t make it 
through the night. We haven’t 
risked a penny, Maurillo. Not a 
stinking cent.”

TJETURNING TO the office, 
Northrop turned the papers 
on the Gardner amputation over 
to his assistants, set the wheels 
in motion for the show and pre- 
pared to call it a day. 

There was only one bit of dirty 
work left to do. He had to fire 
Maurillo. 

It wasn’t called firing, of 
course. Maurillo had tenure, just 
like the hospital orderlies and 
everyone else below executive 
rank. It would have to be more a 
kick upstairs than an 3 ^hing else. 

Northrop had been increasingly 
dissatisfied with the little man’s 
work for months now. Today had 
been the clincher. Maurillo had 
no imagination. He didn’t know 
how to close a deal. Why hadn’t 
he thought of underwriting the 
hospitalization? // 1 can*t dele- 
gate responsibility to him, North- 
rop told himself, I can’t use him 
at all. There were plenty of other 
assistant producers in the outfit 
who’d be glad to step in. 

Northrop spoke to a couple of 
them. He made his choice: A 
young fellow named Barton, 
who’d been working on documen- 
taries all year. Barton had done 
the plane-crash deal in London 
in the spring. He had a fine touch 
for the gruesome. He had been 
on hand at the Worlds’ Fair fire 
last year at Juneau. Yes, Barton 
was the man. 

The next part was the sticky 



one. Things could go wrong. 

Northrop phoned Maurillo, 
even though Maurillo was even 
two rooms away — these things 
were never done in person — and 
said, “I’ve got some good news 
for you, Ted. We’re shifting you 
to a new program.” 

“Shifting — ?” 

“That’s right. We had a talk in 
here this afternoon, and we de- 
cided you were being wasted on 
the blood-and-guts show. You 
need more scope for your talents. 
So we’re giving you a fat raise, 
boy, and we’re moving you over 
to Kiddie Time. We think you’ll 
really blossom there. You and 
Sam Kline and Ed Bragan ought 
to make a terrific team,” 

Northrop saw Maurillo’s 
pudgy face crumble. The arith- 
metic was getting home; over 
here, Maurillo was Number Two, 
and on the new show, a much 
less important one, he’d be Num- 
ber Three. The pay meant noth- 
ing, of course; didn’t Internal 
Revenue take it all anyway? It 
was a thiunping boot, and Mau- 
rillo knew it 

The mores of the situation 
called for Maurillo to pretend he 
was receiving a rare honor. He 
didn’t play the game. He squinted 
and said, “Just because I didn’t 
sign up that old man’s amputa- 
tion?” 

“What makes you think — ” 

“Three years I’ve been with 



94 



GALAXY 



you! Three years, and you kick 
me out just like that!” 

“I told you, Ted, we thought 
this would be a big opportunity 
for you. It’s a step up the ladder. 
It’s — 

Maurillo’s fleshy face puffed 
up with rage. “It’s getting 
junked,” he said bitterly. “Well, 
never mind, huh? It so happens 
Tve got another offer. I’m quitting 
before you can can me. You can 
take your tenure and — ” 

Northrop hastily blanked the 
screen. 

The idiot, he thought The fat 
little idiot. Well, to hell with him! 

He cleared his desk, and 
cleared his mind of Ted Maurillo 
and his problems. Life was real, 
life was earnest. Maurillo just 
couldn’t take the pace, that was 
all. 

Northrop prepared to go home. 
It had been a long day. 

A t eight that evening came 
word that old Gardner was 
about to undergo the amputation. 
At ten, Northrop was phoned by 
the network’s own head surgeon, 
Dr. Steele, with the news that the 
operation had failed. 

“We lost him,” Steele said in a 
flat, unconcerned voice. “We did 
our best, but he was a mess. Fibril- 
lation set in, and his heart just 
ran away. Not a damned thing 
we could do.” 

“Did the leg come off?” 



“Oh, sure. All this was after the 
operation.” 

“Did it get taped?” 

“Processing it now.” 

“Okay,” Northrop said. “Thanks 
for calling.” 

“Sorry about the patient.” 
“Don’t worry yourself,” North- 
rop said. “It happens to the best 
of us.” 

The next morning, Northrop 
had a look at the rushes. The 
screening was in the 23rd Floor 
studio, and a select audience was. 
on hand — Northrop, his new 
assistant producer Barton, a hand- 
ful of network executives, a cou- 
ple of men from the cutting room. 
Slick, bosomy girls handed out 
intensifier helmets. No mechani- 
cals doing the work here! 

Northrop slipped the helmet on 
over his head. He felt the familiar 
surge of excitement as the elec- 
trodes descended and contact was 
made. He closed his eyes. There 
was a thrum of power somewhere 
in the room as the EEG-amplifler 
went into action. The screen 
brightened. 

There was the old man. There 
was the gangrenous leg. There 
was Dr. Steele, crisp and rugged 
and dimple-chinned, the network’s 
star surgeon, $250,000 a year’s 
worth of talent. There was the 
scalpel, gleaming in Steele’s hand. 

Northrop began to sweat. The 
amplified brain waves were com- 
ing through the intensifier, and he 



THE PAIN PEDDLERS 



95 



felt the throbbing in the old man’s 
leg, felt the dull haze of pain be- 
hind the old man’s forehead, felt 
the weakness of being eighty 
years old and half dead. 

Steele was checking out the 
electronic scalpel, now, while the 
nurses fussed around, preparing 
the man for the amputation. In 
the finished tape, there would be 
music, narration, all the trim- 
mings, but now there was just a 
soundless series of images, and, 
of course, the tapped brain-waves 
of the sick man. 

The leg was bare. 

The scalpel descended. 

Northrop winced as vicarious 
agony shot through him. He could 
feel the blazing pain, the brief 
searing hell as the scalpel slashed 
through diseased flesh and rotting 
bone. His whole body trembled, 
and he bit down hard on his lips 
and clenched his fists, and then it 
was over. 

There was a cessation of pain. 
A catharsis. The leg no longer 
sent its pulsating messages to the 
weary brain. Now there was 
shock, the anesthesia of hyp>ed-up 
pain, and with the shock came 
calmness. Steele went about the 
mop-up operation. He tidied the 
stump, bound it. 

The rushes flickered out in 
anticlimax. Later, the production 
crew would tie up the program 
with interviews of the family, per- 
haps a shot of the funeral, a few 



observations on the problem of 
gangrene in the aged. Those 
things were the extras. What 
counted, what the viewers wanted, 
was the sheer nastiness of vicari- 
ous pain, and that they got in 
full measure. It was a gladiatorial 
contest without the gladiators, 
masochism concealed as medi- 
cine. It worked. It pulled in the 
viewers by the million. 

Northrop patted sweat from 
his forehead. 

“Looks like we got ourselves 
quite a little show here, boys,” he 
said in satisfaction. 

^I^HE MOOD of satisfaction was 
still on him as he left the 
building that day. All day he 
had worked hard, getting the 
show into its final shape, cutting 
and polishing. He enjoyed the 
element of craftsmanship. It 
helped him to forget some of the 
sordidness of the program. 

Night had fallen when he left. 
He stepped out of the main en- 
trance and a figure strode for- 
ward, a bulky figure, medium 
height, tired face. A hand reached 
out, thrusting him roughly back 
into the lobby of the building 

At first Northrop didn’t recog- 
nize the face of the man. It was 
a blank face, a nothing face, a 
middle-aged empty face. Then he 
placed it. 

Harry Gardner. The son of the 
dead man. 



96 



GALAXY 



“Murderer!” Gardner shrilled. 
“You killed him! He would have 
lived if you’d used anesthetics! 
You phony, you murdered him 
so people would have thrills on 
television!” 

Northrop glanced up the lobby. 
Someone was coming, around the 
the bend. Northrop felt calm. He 
could stare this nobody down un- 
til he fled in fear. 

“Listen,” Northrop said, “we 
did the best medical science can 
do for your father. We gave him 
the ultimate in scientific care. 
We — ” 

“You murdered him!” 

“No,” Northrop said, and then 
he said no more, because he saw 
the sudden flicker of a slice-gun 
in the blank-faced man’s fat hand. 

He backed away. But it didn’t 
help, because Gardner punched 
the trigger and an incandescent 
bolt flared out, and sliced across 
Northrop’s belly just as efficiently 
as the surgeon’s scalpel had cut 
through the gangrenous leg. 

Gardner raced away, feet clat- 
tering on the marble floor. North- 
rop dropped, clutching himself. 

His suit was seared. There was 
a slash through his abdomen, a 
bum an eighth of an inch wide 
and perhaps four inches deep, cut- 
ting through intestines, through 
organs, through flesh. The pain 
hadn’t begun yet. His nerves 
weren’t getting the message 
through to his stunned brain. 



But then they were; and North- 
rop coiled and twisted in agony 
that was anything but vicarious 
now. 

Footsteps approached. 

“Jeez,” a voice said. 

Northrop forced an eye open. 
Maurillo. Of all people, Maurillo. 

“A doctor,” Northrop wheezed. 
“Fast! Christ, the pain! Help me, 
Ted!” 

Maurillo looked down, and 
smiled. Without a word, he 
stepped to the telephone booth 
six feet away, dropped in a token, 
punched out a call. 

“Get a van over here, fast. I’ve 
got a subject, chief.” 

I^ORTHROP writhed in tor- 
^ ment. Maurillo crouched next 
to him. “A doctor,” Northrop mur- 
mured. “A needle, at least. Gimme 
a needle! The pain — ” 

“You want me to kill the pain?” 
Maurillo laughed. “Nothing doing. 
You just hang on. You stay alive 
till we get that hat on your head 
and tape the whole thing.” 

“But you don’t work for me — 
you’re off the program — ” 

“Sure,” Maurillo said. “I’m with 
Transcontinental now. They’re 
starting a blood-and-guts show 
too. Only they don’t need 
waivers.” 

Northrop gaped. Transconti- 
nental? That bootleg outfit that 
peddled tapes in Afghanistan and 
Mexico and Ghana and God knew 



the pain peddlers 



97 



where else? Not even a network 
show, he thought! No fee! Dying 
in agony for the benefit of a 
bunch of lousy tapeleggers. That 
was the worst part, Northrop 
thought Only Maurillo would 
pull a deal like that. 

“A needle! For God’s sake, 
Maurillo, a needle!” 

“Nothing doing. The van’ll be 
here any minute. They’ll sew you 
up, and we’ll tape it nice.” 



Northrop closed his eyes. He 
felt the coiling intestines blazing 
within him. He willed himself to 
die, to cheat Maurillo. 

But it was no use. He remained 
alive and suffering. 

He lived for an hour. That was 
plenty of time to tape his dying 
agonies. The last thought he had 
was that it was a damned shame 
he couldn’t star on his own show

CONCLUSION 





THl STARS 

By CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 



WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 



Enoch Wallace was a strange man living in a strange world. He had 
lived in it for mare than a century, since that first day when the alien 
creature who called himself Ulysses appeared to him and offered him the 
secret task of maintaining a transfer-point on Earth for the use of the 
galactic civilization. 

The offer had certain advantages. For one thing, it conferred near- 
immortality. For another, it offered a chance to discover truths beyond the 
horizon of Earth. Enoch accepted, and began a life that shut him off from 
all his friends and neighbors — but brought him new ones. 

First were the star travelers themselves, creatures of a thousand races 
who passed through the Earth station en route from one alien planet to 
another. Some were so strange and inhumon that Enoch could not com- 
municate with them. Others were very like him ... in every respect except 
appearance. Shrunken or huge, tentacled or shapeless, these visitors become 
friends, almost the only friends he had. 

His other friends were stranger still. They were ihe creatures of his mind 
— the lovely woman named Mary, the dashing Civil War officer who was 
Enoch's imaginary ideal of a friend — who were summoned out of his own 
subconscious to give him companionship, and given form through the arts 
of the galactic civilizotion. 

Enoch could no longer think of the place he lived in as "home"; it had 
been only "The Station" tor so many years, it too changed. Its outward 
appearance was the same as the century-old farmhouse in which He had 
spent his boyhood. But it had been altered inside, to provide the communic- 
ations equipment and the matter-transmitting tanks that served its function; 
its outside too was changed, though imperceptibly, to make it the most 
secure fortress Earth had ever seen. No human thing could pierce those 
walls. No man or woman could open its doors except Enoch himself. 

His life of mystery was a challenge to the neighbors on the little farms 
nearby, especially to the family of the strange, mute girl named Lucy who 
wos almost his only contact with the outside world. Even more it challenged 
the men from the United States government who had come to investigate 
rumors of strange goings-on . and found mysteries far beyond the 
rumors. Every move Enoch made was watched. The world was closing in on 
him. And at the same time there was trouble in the galactic civilization 
itself, a trouble that centered around the queer, symbolic object called 
The Talisman. Enoch could not understand what was happening; he could 
only wonder, and retreat to the company of his own mind-companions . 

But even they seemed to be turning against him. 

They knew what they were: figments of his imagination, and nothing 
more. And they would not let him forget It. 



■j^TARY HAD said that they 
must face up to the kind of

ing -

things they were. 

And what were they? Not 
what did he think they were, but 
what were they actually? What 
did they think themselves to be? 
For perhaps they knew much 
better than did he. 

Where had Mary gone? When 
she left this room, into what kind 
of limbo did she disappear? Did 
she still exist? And if so, what 
kind of an existence would it be? 
Would she be stored away some- 
where as a little girl would store 
away her doll in a box pushed 
back into the closet with all the 
other dolls? 

He tried to imagine limbo. It 
was a nothingness; and if that 
were true, a being pushed into 
limbo would be an existence with- 
in a non-existence. There would 
be nothing — not space nor time, 
nor light, nor air. No color and 
no vision; just a never-ending 
nothing, that must lie at some 
point outside the universe. 

He cried inside himself, Mary, 
what have I done to you! 

And the answer lay there, hard 
and naked. 

He had dabbled in a thing 
which he had not understood. 
And had, furthermore, committed 
that greater sin of thinking that 
he did understand. The fact of 



here gather the stars 



the matter was that he had under- 
stood enough to make the con- 
cept work, but not enough to 
know its consequences. 

With creation went responsi- 
bility. He was not equipped to 
assume responsibility for what 
he had done. 

They hated him and resented 
him. He did not blame them. He’d 
led them out and shown them the 
promised land of humanity — and 
then had led them back. He had 
given them everything that a hu- 
man being had with one excep- 
tion: the ability to exist within 
the human world. 

They all hated him but Mary, 
and for Mary it was worse than 
hate. For she was condemned to 
love the monster who had cre- 
ated her. 

Hate me, Mary! he pleaded. 
Hate me like the others! 

TTE HAD thought of them as 
shadow people, but the label 
had been wrong. They were nei- 
ther shadowy or ghost-like. To 
the eyes they were solid and sub- 
stantial, as real as any people. It 
was only when you tried to touch 
them that they were not real — 
for when you tried to touch them, 
there was nothing there. 

A figment of his mind, he’d 
thought at first, but now he was 
not sure. At first they’d come only 
when he'd called them up, using 
the knowledge and the techniques 



100 



101 



that he had acquired in his study 
of work done by the thaumatur- 
gists of Alphard XXII. But in 
recent years he had not called 
them up. There had been no oc- 
casion to. They anticipated him, 
and came. 

David Ransome was himself, 
as he had dreamed himself to be, 
as he had wished himself to be 
— but, of course, as he had never 
been. He was the dashing Union 
officer, of not so high a rank as to 
be stiff and stodgy, but a fair cut 
above the man of ordinary stand- 
ing. He was trim and debonair 
and definitely dare-devilish, loved 
by all the women, admired by 
all the men. He was a bom leader 
and a good fellow all at once, at 
home alike in the field or draw- 
ing room. 

And Mary? Funny, he thought, 
he had never called her anything 
but Mary. There had never been 
a surname. She had been simply 
Mary. 

And she was at least two wom- 
en, if not more than that. She was 
Sally Brown, who once had lived 
just down the road — and how 
long had it been, he wondered, 
since he’d thought of Sally 
Brown? And she was as well a 
tall, stately daughter of the South, 
the woman he had seen for a few 
moments only as he marched a 
dusty road in the hot Virginia 
sun. There had been a mansion, 
one of those great plantation 

102 



















houses, set back from the road, 
and she had been standing on 
the portico, beside one of the 
great white pillars, watching the 
enemy march past. Her hair was 
black and her complexion whiter 
than the pillar and she had stood 
so straight and proud, so dehant 
and imperious that he had re- 
membered her and thought of 
her, dreamed of her — although 
he never spoke to her or knew 
her name. 

So Mary had been both of 
these — Sally Brown and the un- 
known Virginia belle standing by 
the pillar to watch the troops 
march by — the shadow of them 
and perhaps of many others as yet 
unrealized by him, a composite 
of all he had ever known or seen 
or admired in women. She had 
been an ideal and perfection. She 
had been his perfect woman, cre- 
ated in his mind. And now, like 
Sally Brown, resting in her grave; 
like the Virginia belle, lost in 
the mists of time; like all the 
others who may have contributed 
to his molding of her, she was 
gone from him. 

If he only could be sure, he 
thought, of where she might be 
now. If he only could be certain 
that she was in a semblance of 
death and untortured by her 
thoughts. 

To believe that she was sen- 
tient was more than one could 
bear. 



T¥E HEARD the hooting of the 
whistle that said a message 
waited and he took his head out 
of his hands. But he did not get 
up off the sofa. 

Numbly his hand reached out 
to the coffee table that stood be- 
fore the sofa, its top covered with 
some of the more colorful of the 
geegaws and gimcracks that had 
been left as gifts by travelers. 

He picked up a cube of some- 
thing that might have been some 
strange sort of glass or translu- 
cent stone — he had never been 
able to decide which it was, if 
either — and cupped it in his 
hands. Staring into it he saw a 
tiny picture, three dimensional 
and detailed, of a faery world. It 
was a prettily grotesque place, 
set inside what might have been a 
forest glade, surrounded by what 
appeared to be flowering toad- 
stools. Drifting down through the 
air, as if it might have been a 
part of the air itself, came what 
looked for all the world like a 
shower of jeweled snow, spar- 
kling and glinting in the violet 
light of a great blue sun. 

There were things dancing in 
the glade. They looked more like 
flowers than animals, but they 
moved with a grace and poetry 
that fired one’s blood to watch. 
Then the faery place was wiped 
out and there was another place 
— a wild and dismal place, with 
grim, gaunt, beetling cliffs rear- 



104 



GALAXY 



ing high against a red and angry 
gky, while great flying things that 
looked like flapping dishrags 
beat their way up and down the 
cliffs, and there were others of 
them roosting, most obscenely, 
upon the scraggly projections that 
must have been some sort of mis- 
shapen trees growing from the 
very wall of rock. And from far 
below, from some distance that 
one could only guess, came the 
lonesome thundering of a rushing 
river. 

He put the cube back upon the 
table. 

He wondered what it was that 
one saw within its depths. It was 
like turning the pages of a book, 
with each page a picture of a dif- 
ferent place, but never anything 
to tell where that place might be. 
When he first had been given it, 
he had spent fascinated hours, 
watching the pictures change as 
he held it in his hands. There had 
never been a picture that looked 
even faintly like any other picture 
and there was no end to them. 
One got the feeling that these 
were not pictures, actually, but 
that one were looking at the scene 
itself and that at any moment 
one might lose his perch upon 
wherever he was roosting and 
plimge head-first down into the 
place itself. 

But it had finally palled upon 
him. It was a senseless business, 
gawking at a long series of places 

HERE GATHER THE STARS 



that had no identity. Senseless to 
him, of course, he thought; but 
not senseless, certainly, to that 
native of Enif V who had given 
it to him. It might, for all he 
knew, Enoch told himself, be of 
great significance and a treasure 
of great value. 

That was the way it was with 
so many of the things he had. 
Even the ones that had given 
pleasure, he knew, he might be 
using wrongly, or, at least, in a 
way that had not been intended. 

TiUT THERE were some — a 
few, perhaps — that did have 
a value he could understand and 
appreciate, although in many in- 
stances their functions were of 
little use to him. There was the 
tiny clock that gave the local 
times for all the sectors of the 
galaxy. There was the perfume 
mixer — which was as close as he 
could come in naming it — which 
allowed a person to create the spe- 
cific scent desired. Just get the 
mixture that one wanted and 
turn it on, and the room took on 
that scent until one should turn 
it off. He’d had some fun with it; 
one bitter winter day when, after 
long experimenting, he had 
achieved the scent of apple blos- 
soms, and had lived a day in 
spring while a blizzard howled 
outside. 

He reached out and picked up 
another piece — a beautiful thing 



105 



that always had intrigued him, 
but for which he had never found 
a use. If, indeed, it had a use. It 
might be no more than a piece of 
art, a pretty thing that was meant 
to look at only. But it had a cer- 
tain feel (if that were the word) 
which had led him to believe that 
it might have some specific func- 
tion. 

It was a pyramid of spheres, 
succeeding smaller spheres set on 
larger spheres. Some fourteen 
inches tall, it was a graceful piece, 
with each of the spheres a differ- 
ent color. Not just a color painted 
on; each color so deep and true 
that one knew instinctively the 
color was intrinsic to each sphere, 
that the entire sphere, from the 
center of it out to the surface, was 
all of its particular color. 

There was nothing to indicate 
that any glue-like medium had 
been used to mount the spheres 
and hold them in their places. It 
looked for all the world as if 
someone had simply piled the 
spheres, one atop the other . 
and they had stayed that way. 

Holding it in his hands, he 
tried to recall who had given it 
'to him, but he had no memory 
of it. 

The whistle of the message ma- 
chine still was calling and there 
was work to do. He could not 
sit here, he told himself, mooning 
the afternoon away. He put the 
pyramid of spheres back on the 



table top, and rising, went across 
the room. 

The message said; NO. 406,302 
TO STATION 18327. NATIVE 
OF VEGA XXI ARRIVING AT 
16532.82. DEPARTURE INDE- 
TERMINATE. NO LUGGAGE 
CABINET ONLY, LOCAL CON- 
DITIONS. CONFIRM. 

Enoch felt a glow of happiness, 
looking at the message. It would 
be good to have a Hazer once 
again. It had been a month or 
more since one had passed 
through the station. 

He could remember back to 
that first day he had ever met 
a Hazer, when the five of them 
had come. It must have been, he 
thought, back in 1914 or, maybe, 
1915. World War I, which every- 
one then was calling the Great 
War, was underway, he knew. 

The Hazer would be arriving 
at about the same time as Ulysses 
and the three of them could spend 
a pleasant evening. It was not 
often that two good friends visited 
here at once. 

He stood a bit aghast at think- 
ing of the Hazer as a friend, for 
more than likely the being itself 
was one he had never met. But 
that made little difference. A 
Hazer, any Hazer, would turn out 
to be a friend. 

He got the cabinet in position 
beneath a materializer unit and 
double-checked to be sure that 



everything was exactly as it 
should be, then went back to the 
message machine and sent off 
the confirmation. 

And all the time his memory 
kept on nagging at him. Had it 
been 1914, or perhaps a little 
later? 

At the catalogue cabinet, he 
pulled out a drawer and found 
Vega XXI and the first date 
listed was July 12, 1915. He 
found the record book on the 
shelf and pulled it out and 
brought it to the desk. He leafed 
through it rapidly until he found 
the date. 

XII 

JULY 12, 1915. Arrived this 
J afternoon (3:20 p.m.) five be- 
ings from Vega XXI, the first of 
their kind to pass through this sta- 
tion. They are biped and human- 
oid, and one gains the impression 
that they are not made of flesh — 
that flesh would be too gross for 
die kind of things they are. But, of 
course, they are made of flesh the 
same as anyone. They glow. Not 
with a visible light; but there is 
about them an aura that goes with 
them wherever they may be. 

They were, I gathered, a sexual 
unit, the five of them — although 
I am not so certain I understand, 
for it is most confusing. They 
were happy and friendly. They 
carried with them an air of faint 
amusement, not at anything in par- 



ticular, but at the universe itself, 
as if they might have enjoyed 
some sort of cosmic and very pri- 
vate joke that was known to no 
one else. They were on a holiday. 
They were en route to a festival 
(although that may not be the 
precise word for it) on another 
planet, where other life forms 
were gathering for a week of car- 
nival. Just how or why they had 
been invited I was unable to de- 
termine. It must surely have been 
a great honor for them to be 
going there, but so far as I could 
see they did not seem to think 
so, but took it as their right. They 
were very happy and without a 
care and extremely self-assured 
and poised. But, thinking back on 
it, I would suppose that they are 
always that way. I found myself 
just a little envious at not being 
able to be as carefree and gay 
as they were, and trying to imag- 
ine how fresh life and the uni- 
verse must seem to them. And a 
little resentful they could be, so 
unthinkingly, as happy as they 
were. 

I had, according to instruc- 
tions, hung hammocks so that 
they could rest, but they did not 
use them. They brought with 
them hampers that were filled 
with food and drink and sat down 
at my table and began to talk 
and feast. They asked me to sit 
with them. They chose two dishes 
and a bottle, which they assured 



106 



GALAXY 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



107 



me would be safe for me to eat 
and drink, the rest of their fare 
being somewhat doubtful for a 
metabolism such as mine. The 
food was delicious and of a kind 
I had never tasted — one dish 
being rather like the rarest and 
most delicate of old cheeses, and 
the other of a sweetness that was 
heavenly. The drink was some- 
what like the finest of brandies, 
yellow in color and no heavier 
than water. 

^HEY ASKED me about my- 
self and about my planet and 
they were courteous and seemed 
genuinely interested. They were 
quick of understanding in the 
things 1 told them. They told me 
they were headed for a planet, 
the name of which I had not 
heard before, and they talked 
among themselves, gaily and hap- 
pily, but in such a way that I did 
not seem to be left out. From 
their talk I gained the fact that 
some form of art was being pre- 
sented at the festival on this 
planet. The art form was not 
alone of music or painting, but 
was composed of sound and color 
and emotion and form, and other 
qualities for which there seem to 
be no words in the language of 
the Earth, and which I do not 
entirely recognize, only gaining 
the very faintest inkling of what 
they were talking of in this par- 
ticular regard. I gained the im- 






pression of a three-dimensional 
symphony — although this is not 

entirely the right expression 

which had been composed, not by 
a single being, but by a team of 
beings. They talked of the art 
form enthusiastically. I seemed to 
understand that jt would not last 
for only several hours, but for 
days, and that it was an experi- 
ence rather than a listening or 
seeing and that the spectators or 
audience did not merely sit and 
listen, but could, if they wished 
and must, to get the most out of 
it, be participants. But I could not 
understand how they participated 
and felt I should not ask. 

They talked of the people they 
would meet and when they had 
met them last and gossiped con- 
siderably about them, although in 
kindly fashion, leaving the im- 
pression that they and many other 
people went from planet to plan- 
et for some happy purpose. But 
whether there was any purpose 
other than enjoyment in their go- 
ing, I could not determine. I 
gathered that there might be. 

They spoke of other festivals. 
Not all of them were concerned 
with the one art form, but with 
other more specialized aspects of 
the arts, of which I could gain no 
adequate idea. They seemed to 
find a great and exuberant hap- 
piness in the festivals. It seemed 
to me that some certain signifi- 
cances aside from the art itself 



contributed greatly to that happi- 
ness. 

I did not join in this part of 
dieir conversation, for, frankly, 
there was no opportunity. I would 
have liked to ask some questions, 
jjut I had no chance. I suppose 
that if I had, my questions must 
have sounded stupid to them; but 
given the chance, that would not 
have bothered me too much. And 
yet in spite of this, they managed 
somehow to make me feel I was 
included in their conversation. 
There was no obvious attempt to 
do this, and yet they made me 
feel I was one with them and 
not simply a station keeper they 
would spend a short time with. 

At times they spoke briefly in 
the language of their planet, 
which is one of the most beauti- 
ful I have ever heard, but for the 
most part they conversed in the 
vernacular used by a number of 
the humanoid races, a sort of pidg- 
inianguage made up for conven- 
ience. 'I susp>ect that this was done 
out of courtesy to me, and a great 
courtesy it was. I believe that they 
were truly the most civilized peo- 
ple I have ever met. 

r HAVE said they glowed. I 
* think by that I mean they 
^owed in spirit. It seemed that 
Aey were accompanied, somehow, 
by a sparkling golden haze that 
made happy everything it touched 
— almost as if they moved in 



some special world that no one 
else had found. Sitting at the table 
with them, I seemed to be in- 
cluded in this golden haze and I 
felt strange, quiet, deep currents 
of happiness flowing in my veins. 
I wondered by what route they 
and their world had arrived at this 
golden state and if my world 
could, in some distant time, attain 
it. 

But back of this happiness was 
a great vitality, the bubbling, ef- 
fervescent spirit with an inner 
core of strength and a love of 
living that seemed to fill every 
pore of them and every instant 
of their time. 

They had only two hours’ time. 
It passed so swiftly that I had to 
finally warn them it was time to 
go. Before they left, they placed 
two packages on the table and 
said they were for me. They 
thanked me for my table (what a 
strange way for them to put it). 
Then they said good-by and step- 
ped into the cabinet (the extra 
large one), and I sent them on 
their way. 

Even after they were gone, the 
golden haze seemed to linger in 
the room. It was hours before all 
of it was gone. I wished that I 
might have gone with them to 
that other planet and its festival. 

One of the packages they left 
contained a dozen bottles of the 
brandy-like liquor. The bottles 
themselves were each a piece of 



108 



GALAXY 



here gather the stars 



109 



art, no two of them alike, being 
formed of what I am convinced 
is diamond; but whether fabri- 
cated diamond or carved from 
some great stones, I have no idea. 
At any rate, I would estimate that 
each of them is priceless, and each 
carved in a disturbing variety of 
symbolisms, each of which, how- 
ever, has a special beauty of its 
own. 

In the other box was a — well, 
I suppose that, for lack of other 
name, you might call it a music 
box. The box itself is ivory, old 
yellow ivory that is as smooth as 
satin, covered by a mass of dia- 
grammatic carving which must 
have some significance which I do 
not understand. 

On the top of it is a circle set 
inside a graduated scale. When I 
turned the circle to the first gradu- 
ation there was music and through 
all the room an interplay of many- 
colored light, as if the entire room 
was filled with different kinds of 
color, and through it all a far-off 
suggestion of that golden haze. 
And from the box came, too, per- 
fumes that filled the room, and 
feeling, emotion — whatever one 
may call it — but something that 
took hold of one and made one 
said or happy or whatever might 
go with the music and the color 
and perfume. Out of that box 
came a world in which one lived 
out the composition or whatever 
it might be — living it with all 



that one had in him, all the enjo.' 
tion and belief and intellect of 
which one is capable. 

Here, I am quite certain, wag 
a recording of that art form of 
which they had been talking. And 
not one composition alone, but 
206 of them, for that is the num- 
ber of the graduation marks and 
for each mark there is a separate ! 
composition. In the days to come 
I shall play them all and make 
notes upon each of them and as- 
sign them names, perhaps, accord- 
ing to their characteristics, and 
from them, perhaps, can gain some 
knowledge as well as entertain- 
ment. 

XIII 

^ I ^HE TWELVE diamond bot- 
ties, empty long ago, stood in 
a sparkling row upon the fireplace 
mantle. The music box, as one of 
his most choice possessions, was 
stored inside one of the cabinet^ 
where no harm could come to it 
Enoch thought, rather ruefully, 
that in all these years, despite reg- 
ular use of it, he had not as yet 
played through the entire list of 
compositions. There were so many 
of the early ones that begged for 
a replaying that he was not a great 
deal more than halfway through 
the graduated markings. 

The Hazers had come back, the 
five of them, time and time again, 
for it seemed that they found in 

GALAXY 



{his station, perhaps even in the 
man who operated it, some qual- 
ity that pleased them. They had 
helped him learn the Vegan lan- 
guage and had brought him scrolls 
of Vegan literature and many 
other things. They had been, with- 
out any doubt, the best friends 
among the aliens (other than 
Ulysses) that he had ever had. 
Then one day they came no more. 
He wondered why, asking after 
them when other Hazers showed 
up at the station. But he had never 
learned what had happened to 
them. 

That was the way it was with 
so many things. The galaxy was 
so large and so diverse and com- 
plex that you could never hope to 
keep in step with it. There was 
too much to know and too much 
to understand. And a large part 
of it was beyond human under- 
standing. 

He knew far more now about 
the Hazers and their art forms, 
their traditions and their customs 
and their history, than he’d known 
that first day he’d written of them, 
back in 1915. But he still was far 
from grasping many of the con- 
cepts that were commonplace 
with them. 

There had been many of them 
since that day in 1915 and there 
was one he remembered in par- 
ticular — the old, wise one, the 
philosopher, who had died on the 
floor beside the sofa. 



They had been sitting on the 
sofa, talking. He even could re- 
member the subject of their talk. 
The old one had been telling of 
the perverse code of ethics, at 
once irrational and comic, which 
had been built up by that curious 
race of social vegetables he had 
encountered on one of his visits 
to an off-track planet on the other 
side of the galactic rim. The old 
Hazer had a drink or two beneath 
his belt and he was in splendid 
form, relating incident after in- 
cident with enthusiastic gusto. 

Suddenly, in mid-sentence, he 
stopped his talking, and slumped 
quietly forward. Enoch, startled, 
reached for him. But before he 
could lay a hand upon him, the 
old alien slid slowly to the floor. 

The golden haze faded from 
his body and slowly flickered out. 
The body lay there, angular and 
bony and obscene, a terribly alien 
thing there upon the floor, a thing 
that was at once pitiful and mon- 
strous. More monstrous, it seemed 
to Enoch, than an 3 ^hing in alien 
form he had ever seen before. 

TN LIFE it had been a wondrous 
creature, but now, in death, 
it was an old bag of hideous 
bones with a scaly parchment 
stretched to hold the bones to- 
gether. It was. the golden haze, 
Enoch told himself, gulping, in 
something near to horror, that had 
made the Hazer seem so won- 



110 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



111 



drous and so beautiful, so vital, 
so alive and quick, so filled with 
dignity. The golden haze was the 
life of them. When the haze was 
gone they became mere repulsive 
horrors that one gagged to look 
upon. 

Could it be, he wondered, that 
the goldenness was the Hazers’ 
life force and that they wore it 
like a cloak, as a sort of overall 
disguise? Did they wear their life 
force outside of them while all 
other creatures wore it on the in- 
side? 

A piteous little wind was la- 
menting in the gingerbread high 
up in the gables. Through the win- 
dows he could see battalions of 
tattered clouds fleeing in ragged 
retreat across the moon, which 
had climbed halfway up the east- 
ern sky. 

There was a coldness and a 
loneliness in the station — a far- 
reaching loneliness that stretched 
out and out, farther than mere 
Earth loneliness could go. 

Enoch turned from the body 
and walked stiffly across the room 
to the message machine. He put 
in a call for a connection direct 
with Galactic Central, then stood 
waiting, gripping the sides of the 
machine with both his hands. 

GO AHEAD, said Galactic 
Central. 

Briefly, as objectively as he was 
able, Enoch reported what had 
happened. 



There was no hesitation and 
there were no questions from the 
other end. Just simple direction* 
(as if this was something that hap. 
pened all the time) on how the 
situation should be handled. The 
Vegan must remain upon the 
planet of its death, its body to be 
disposed of according to the local 
customs obtaining on that planet. 
For that was the Vegan law, and, 
likewise, a point of honor. A Ve- 
gan, when he fell, must stay where 
he fell, and that place became 
forever, a part of Vega XXI. 
There were such places, said Ga- 
lactic Central, all through the 
galaxy. 

THE CUSTOM HERE, typed 
Enoch, IS TO INTER THE 
DEAD. 

THEN INTER THE VEGAN. 

WE READ A VERSE OR 
TWO FROM OUR HOLY 
BOOK. 

READ ONE FOR THE VE- 
GAN, THEN. YOU CAN DO 
ALL THIS? 

YES. BUT WE USUALLY 
HAVE IT DONE BY A PRAC- 
TITIONER OF RELIGION. 
UNDER THE PRESENT CIR- 
CUMSTANCES. HOWEVER, 
THAT MIGHT BE UNWISE. 

AGREED, said Galactic Cen- 
tral. YOU CAN DO AS WELL 
YOURSELF? 

I CAN. 

IT IS BEST THEN THAT 
YOU DO. 



WILL THERE BE RELA- 
TIVES OR FRIENDS ARRIV- 
ING FOR THE RITES? 

NO. 

YOU WILL NOTIFY THEM? 

THEY ALREADY KNOW. 

HE ONLY DIED A MO- 
MENT OR TWO AGO. 

NEVERTHELESS THEY 
know. 

WHAT ABOUT A DEATH 
CERTIFICATE? 

NONE IS NEEDED. THEY 
KNOW OF WHAT HE DIED. 

HIS LUGGAGE? THERE IS 
A TRUNK. 

KEEP IT. IT IS A TOKEN 
FOR THE SERVICES YOU 
PERFORM FOR THE HON- 
ORED DEAD. THAT ALSO IS 
THE LAW. 

BUT THERE MAY BE IM- 
PORTANT MATTERS IN IT. 

YOU WILL KEEP THE 
TRUNK. TO REFUSE WOULD 
INSULT THE MEMORY OF 
THE DEAD. 

ANYTHING ELSE? asked 
Enoch. THAT IS ALL? 

THAT IS ALL. PROCEED 
AS IF THE VEGAN WERE 
ONE OF YOUR OWN. 

t^NOCH CLEARED the ma- 
chine and went back across 
the room. He stood above the 
Hazer, getting up his nerve to 
bend and lift the body to place 
it on the sofa. He shrank from 
touching it. It was so unclean and 



terrible, such a travesty on the 
shining creature that had sat there 
talking with him. 

Since he met the Hazers he had 
loved them and admired them, 
had looked forward to each visit 
by them — by any one of them. 
And now he stood, a shivering 
coward who could not touch one 
dead. 

It was not the horror only. In 
his years as keeper of the station, 
he had seen much of pure visual 
horror as portrayed in alien 
bodies. He had learned to sub- 
merge that sense of horror, to dis- 
regard the outward appearance 
of it, to regard all life as brother 
life, to meet all things as people. 

It was some other unknown fac- 
tor quite apart from horror that 
he felt. And yet this thing, he re- 
minded himself, was a friend of 
his. As a dead friend, it demanded 
honor from him. It demanded 
love and care.. 

Blindly he drove himself to 
the task, stooped and lifted it. 

It had almost no weight at all, 
as if in death it had lost a dimen- 
sion of itself, had somehow be- 
come a smaller thing and less 
significant. Could it be, he won- 
dered, that the golden haze might 
have a weight all of its own? 

He laid the body on the sofa 
and straightened it as best he 
could. Then he went outside and, 
lighting the lantern in the shed, 
went down to the barn.

It had been years since he had 
been there, but nothing much had 
changed. Protected by a tight roof 
from the weather, it had stayed 
snug and dry. There were cob- 
webs hanging from the beams and 
dust was everywhere. Straggling 
clumps of ancient hay, stored in 
the mow above, hung down 
through the cracks in the boards 
that floored the mow. The place 
had a dry, sweet, dusty smell 
about it, all the odors of animals 
and manure long gone. 

Enoch hung the lantern on the 
peg behind the row of stanchions 
and climbed the ladder to the 
mow. Working in the dark, for he 
dared not bring the lantern into 
this dust heap of dried-out hay, 
he found the pile of oaken boards 
far beneath the eaves. 

¥TERE. HE remembered, under- 
neath these slanting eaves, 
had been a pretended cave in 
which, as a boy, he had spent 
many happy rainy days when he 
could not be outdoors. He had 
been Robinson Crusoe in his des- 
ert island cave, or some now 
nameless outlaw hiding from a 
posse, or a man holed up against 
the threat of scalp-hunting Indi- 
ans. He had had a wooden gun 
that he had sawed out of a board, 
working it down later with draw- 
shave and knife and a piece of 
glass to scrape it smooth. It had 
been something he had cherished 



through all his boyhood days 
until that day, when he was 
twelve, that his father, returning 
home from a trip to town, had 
handed him a rifle for his very 
own. 

He explored the stack of boards 
in the dark, determining by feel 
the ones that he would need. 
These he carried to the ladder 
and carefully slid them down to 
the floor below. 

Climbing down the ladder, he 
went up the short flight of stairs 
to the granary, where the tools 
were stored. He opened the lid 
of the great tool chest and found 
that it was filled with long- 
deserted mice nests. Pulling out 
handfuls of the straw and hay and 
grass that the rodents had used 
to set up their one-time house- 
keeping, he uncovered the tools. 
The shine had gone from them, 
their surface grayed by the soft 
patina that came from long dis- 
use. But there was no rust upon 
them and the cutting edges still 
were sharp. 

Selecting the tools he needed, 
he went back to the lower part 
of the barn and fell to work. A 
century ago, he thought, he had 
done as he was doing now, work- 
ing by lantern light to construct 
a coffin. And that time it had 
been his father lying in the house. 

The oaken boards were dry 
and hard, but the tools still were 
in shape to handle them. He 



sawed and planed and hammered 
and there was the smell of saw- 
dust. The barn was snug and si- 
lent, the depth of hay standing 
in the mow drowning out the 
noise of the complaining wind 
outside. 

He finished the coffin. It was 
heavier than he had figured, so 
he found the old wheelbarrow, 
canted against the wall back of 
the stalls that once had been used 
for horses, and loaded the coffin 
on it. Laboriously, stopping often 
to rest, he wheeled it down to 
the little cemetery inside the 
apple orchard. 

And here, beside his father’s 
grave, he dug another grave, hav- 
ing brought a shovel and a pick- 
axe with him. 

TTE DID not dig it as deep as 
he would have liked to dig 
not the full six feet that was de- 
creed by custom, for he knew 
that if he dug it that deep he 
never would be able to get the 
coffin in. So he dug it slightly less 
than four, laboring in the light 
of the canted lantern, set atop 
the mound of dirt to cast its fee- 
ble glow. An owl came up from 
the woods and sat for a while, 
unseen, somewhere in the or- 
chard, muttering and gurgling in 
between his hoots. The moon 
sank toward the west. The ragged 
clouds thinned out to let the stars 
shine through. 



Finally it was finished, with 
the grave completed and the cas- 
ket in the grave and the lantern 
flickering, the kerosene almost 
gone, and the chimney blacked 
from the angle at which the lan- 
tern had been canted. 

Back at the station, Enoch 
hunted up a sheet in which to 
wrap the body. He put a Bible 
in his pocket and picked up the 
shrouded Vegan and, in the first 
faint' light that preceded dawn, 
marched down to the apple or- 
chard. He put the Vegan in the 
coffin and nailed shut the lid, 
then climbed from the grave. 

Standing on the edge of it, he 
took the Bible from his pocket 
and found the place he wanted. 
He read aloud, scarcely needing 
to strain his eyes in the dim light 
to follow the text, for it was from 
a chapter that he had read many 
times: 

“/n my Father’s house are 
many mansions; if it were not so, 
I would have told you . .” 

Thinking, as he read it, how 
appropriate it was; how there 
must need be many mansions in 
which to house all the souls in 
the galaxy — and of all the other 
galaxies that stretched, perhaps 
interminably, through space. Al- 
though if there were understand- 
ing, one might be enough. 

He finished reading and recited 
the burial service, from memory, 
as best he could, not being abso- 



114 



GALAXY,

lately sure of all the words. But 
sure enough, he told himself, to 
make sense out of it. Then he 
shoveled in the dirt 

The stars and moon were gone 
and the wind had died. In the 
quietness of the morning, the east- 
ern sky was pearly pink. 

Enoch stood beside the grave, 
with the shovel in his hand. 

‘‘Good-by, my friend,” he said. 

Then he turned and, in the first 
flush of the morning, went back 
to the station. 

XIV 

'rNOCH GOT up from his desk 
and carried the record book 
back to the shelf and slid it into 
place. 

He turned around and stood 
hesitantly. 

There were things that he 
should do. He should read his 
papers. He should be writing up 
his journal. There were a couple 
of pap>ers in the latest issues of 
the Journal of Geophysical Re- 
search that he should be looking 
at. 

But he didn’t feel like doing 
any of them. There was too much 
to think about, too much to worry 
over, too much to mourn. 

The watchers still were out 
there. He had lost his shadow 
people. And the world was edging 
in toward war. 

Perhaps he should not be 



worrying about what happened 
to the world. He could resign from 
the human race any time he 
wished. If he never went outside, 
if he never opened up the door, 
then it would make no difference 
to him what the world might do 
or what might happen to it. For 
he had a world. He had a greater 
world than anyone outside this 
station had ever dreamed about. 
He did not need the Earth. 

But, even as he thought it, he 
knew he could not make it stick. 
In a very strange and funny way, 
he still did need the Earth. 

He walked over to the door 
and spoke the phrase and the door 
came open. He walked into the 
shed and it closed behind him. 

He went around the corner of 
the house and sat down on the 
steps that led up to the porch. 

This, he thought, was where it 
all had started. He had been sit- 
ting here that summer day of 
long ago when the stars had 
reached out across vast gulfs of 
space and put a finger on him. 

The sun was far down the sky 
toward the west and soon it would 
be evening. Already the heat of 
the day was falling off, with a 
faint, cool breeze creeping up out 
of the hollow that ran down to 
the river valley. Down across the 
field, at the edge of the woods, 
crows were wheeling in the sky 
and cawing. 

It would be hard to shut the 



116 



GALAXY 



door, he knew, and keep it shut. 
Hard never to feel the sun or 
wind again, to never know the 
smell of the changing seasons as 
they came across the Earth. Man, 
he told himself, was not ready 
for that. He had not as yet be- 
come so totally a creature of his 
own created environment that he 
could divorce himself entirely 
from the physical characteristics 
of his native planet. He needed 
sun and soil and wind to remain 
a man. 

He should do this oftener, 
Enoch thought, come out here and 
sit, doing nothing, just looking, 
seeing the trees and the river to 
the west and the blue of the Iowa 
hills across the Mississippi, watch- 
ing the crows wheeling in the 
skies and the pigeons strutting on 
ridgepole of the bam. 

It would be worthwhile each 
day to do it. What was another 
hour of aging? He did not need 
to save his hours — not now, he 
didn’t. There might come a time 
when he’d become very jealous 
of them. When that day came, he 
could hoard the hours and min- 
utes, even the seconds, in as miser- 
ly a fashion as he could manage. 

He heard the sound of the run- 
ning feet as they came around 
the farther comer of the house, a 
stumbling, exhausted running, as 
if the one who ran might have 
come a far way. 

He leaped to his feet and strode 



out into the yard to see who it 
might be and the runner came 
stumbling toward him, with her 
arms outstretched. He put out an 
arm and caught her as she came 
close to him, holding her close 
against him so she would not fall. 

“Lucy!” he cried. “Lucy! What 
has happened, child?” 

TTIS HANDS against her back 
were warm and sticky and 
he took one of them away to see 
that it was smeared with blood. 
The back of her dress was soaked 
and dark. 

He grabbed her by the shoul- 
ders and shoved her away from 
him so he could see her face. It 
was wet with crying. There was 
terror in the face — and pleading 
with the terror. 

She pulled away from him and 
turned around. Her hands came 
up and slipped her dress off her 
shoulders and let it slide halfway 
down her back. The flesh of the 
shoulders were ribboned by long 
slashes that still were oozing 
blood. 

She pulled the dress up again 
and turned to face him. She made 
a pleading gesture and pointed 
backward down the hill, in the 
direction of the field that ran 
down to the woods. 

There was motion down there, 
someone coming through the 
woods, almost at the edge of the 
old, deserted field. 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



117 



She must have seen it, too, for 
she came close against him, shiv- 
ering, seeking his protection. 

He bent and lifted her in his 
arms and ran for the shed. He 
spoke the phrase and the door 
came open and he stepped into 
the station. Behind him he heard 
the door go sliding shut. 

Once inside, he stood there, 
with Lucy Fisher cradled in his 
arms, and knew that what he’d 
done had been a great mistake. 
In a sober moment, he never 
would have done it; if he’d given 
it a second thought, he would not 
have done it. 

But he had acted on an im- 
pulse, with no thought at all. The 
girl had asked protection and here 
nothing in the world ever could 
get at her. But she was a human 
being. And no human being, other 
than himself, should have ever 
crossed the threshold. 

But it was done. Once across 
the threshold, there was no way 
to change it 

He carried her across the room 
and put her on the sofa, then step- 
ped back. She sat there, looking 
up at him, smiling very faintly, 
as if she did not know if she were 
allowed to smile in a place like 
this. She lifted a hand and tried 
to brush away the tears that were 
upon her cheeks. 

She looked quickly around the 
room and her mouth made an O 
of wonder. 



He squatted down and patted 
the sofa and shook a hnger at 
her, hoping that she might under- 
stand that he meant she should 
stay there, that she must go no- 
where else. He swept an arm in 
a motion to take in all the re- 
mainder of the station and shook 
his head as sternly as he could. 

She watched him, fascinated, 
then she smiled and nodded, as if 
she might have understood. 

He reached out and took one 
of her hands in his own and hold- 
ing it, patted it as gently as he 
could, trying to reassure her, to 
make her understand that every- 
thing was all right if she only 
stayed exactly where she was. 

She was smiling now, no longer 
wondering, apparently, if there 
were any reason that she should 
not smile. 

She reached out her free hand 
and made a little fluttering ges- 
ture toward the coffee table, with 
its load of alien gadgets. 

He nodded and she picked up 
one of them, turning it admiringly 
in her hand. 

He got to his feet and went to 
the wall to take down the rifle. 

Then he went outside to face 
whatever had been pursuing her. 

^1 ^WO MEN were coming up 
■*- the field toward the house and 
Enoch saw that one of them was 
Hank Fisher, Lucy’s father. He 
had met the man, rather briefly, 

GALAXY 



several years ago, on one of his 
walks. Hank had explained, rather 
sheepishly and when no explana- 
tion had been necessary, that he 
was hunting for a cow which had 
strayed away. But from his fur- 
tive manner, Enoch had deduced 
that his errand was something 
shadier than the hunting of a cow 
— although he could not imagine 
what it might have been. 

The other man was younger. 
No more, perhaps, than sixteen 
or seventeen. More than likely, 
Enoch told himself, he was one of 
Lucy’s brothers. 

Enoch stood by the porch and 
waited. 

Hank was carrying a coiled whip 
in his hand. Looking at it, Enoch 
understood those wounds on 
Lucy’s shoulders. He felt a swift 
flash of anger, but tried to fight 
it down. He could deal better with 
Hank Fisher if he kept his temper. 

The two men stopped three 
paces or so away. 

“Good afternoon,” said Enoch. 

“You seen my gal?” asked 
Hank. 

“And if I have?” asked Enoch. 

“I’ll take the hide off of her,” 
yelled Hank, flourishing the whip. 

“In such a case,” said Enoch, 

“I don’t believe I’ll tell you any- 
thing.” 

“You got her hid,” charged 
Hank. 

“You can look around,” said 
Enoch. 

HERE GATHER THE STARS 



Hank took a quick step for- 
ward, then thought better of it. 

“She got what she had coming 
to her,” he yelled. “And I ain’t 
finished with her yet. There ain’t 
no one, not even my own flesh 
and blood, can put a hex on me.” 
Enoch said nothing. Hank 
stood, undecided. 

“She meddled,” he said. “She 
had no call to meddle. It was none 
of her damn business.” 

The young man said: “I was 
just trying to train Butcher. 
Butcher,” he explained to Enoch, 
“is a coon-hound pup.” 

“That is right,” said Hank. “He 
wasn’t doing nothing wrong. The 
boys caught a young coon the 
other night. Took a lot of doing. 
Roy, here, had staked out the 
coon to a tree, and he had Butcher 
on a leash. He was letting Butcher 
fight the coon. Not hurting any- 
thing. He’d pull Butcher off be- 
fore any damage could be done 
and let them rest a while. Then 
he’d let Butcher at the coon 
again.” 

“It’s the best way in the world,” 
said Roy, “to train a dog.” 

‘That is right,” said Hank. 
“That is why they caught the 
coon.” 

“We needed it,” said Roy, “to 
train this Butcher pup.” 

44^^HIS all is fine,” said Enoch, 
“and I am glad to hear it. 
But what has it got to do with 



118 



119 



Lucy — and, for that matter, 
with me?” 

“She interfered,” said Hank. 
“She tried to stop the training. 
She tried to grab Butcher away 
from Roy, here.” 

“For a dummy,” Roy said, “she 
is mite too uppity.” 

“You hush your mouth," his 
father told him sternly, swinging 
around on him. 

Roy mumbled to himself, fall- 
ing back a step. 

Hank turned back to Enoch. 

“Roy knocked her down,” he 
said. “He shouldn’t have done 
that. He should have been more 
careful.” 

“I didn’t mean to,” Roy said. 
“I just swung my arm out to keep 
her away from Butcher.” 

“That is right,” said Hank. “He 
swung a bit too hard. But there 
wasn’t any call for her doing what 
she did. She tied Butcher up in 
knots so he couldn’t fight that 
coon. Without laying a finger on 
him, mind you, she tied him up in 
knots. He couldn’t move a muscle. 
That made Roy mad.” He ap- 
pealed to Enoch earnestly. 
“Wouldn’t that have made you 
mad?” 

“I don’t think it would,” said 
Enoch. “But then I’m not a coon- 
dog man.” 

Hank stared in wonder at this 
lack of understanding, but he 
went on with his story. “Roy got 
real mad at her. He’d raised that 



Butcher. He thought a lot of him. 
He wasn’t going to let no one, not 
even his own sister, tie that dog 
in knots. So he went after her and 
she tied him up in knots, just like 
she did to Butcher. I never seen 
a thing like it in all my bom days. 
Roy just stiffened up and then 
he fell down to the ground and 
his legs pulled up against his 
belly and he wrapped his arms 
around himself and he laid there 
on the ground, pulled into a ball. 
Him and Butcher, both. But she 
never touched that coon. She 
never tied him in no knots. Her 
own folks is all she touched.” 

“It didn’t hurt,” said Roy. “It 
didn’t hurt at all.” 

“I was sitting there,” said Hank, 
“braiding this here bull whip. Its 
end had frayed and I fixed a new 
one on it. And I seen it all, but 
I didn’t do a thing until I saw 
Roy there, tied up on the ground. 
And I figured then it had gone 
far enough. I am a broad-minded 
man; I don’t mind a little wart 
charming and other piddling 
things like that. There have been 
a lot of people who have been 
able to do that. It ain’t no dis- 
grace at all. But this thing of 
tying people into knots . 

“So you hit her writh the whip," 
said Enoch. 

66T DID my duty,” Hank told 
-*-him, solemnly. “I ain’t about 
to have no witch in any family 



120 



GALAXY 



of mine. I hit her a couple of 
licks, with her making that dumb 
show of hers to try to get me 
stopped. But I had my duty and 
I kept on hitting. If I did enough 
of it, I figured. I’d knock it out 
of her. That was when she put 
the hex on me. Just like she did 
on Roy and Butcher, but in a 
different way. She turned me 
blind! She blinded her own fath- 
er! I couldn’t see a thing. I just 
stumbled around the yard, yell- 
ing and clawing at my eyes. And 
then they got all right again, but 
she was gone. I saw her running 
ffirough the woods and up the 
hill. So Roy and me, we took out 
after her.” 

“And you think I have her 
here?” 

“I know you have,” said Hank. 

“Okay,” said Enoch. “Have a 
look around.” 

“You can bet I will,” Hank 
told, grimly. “Roy, take the barn. 
She might be hiding there.” 

Roy headed for the bam. Hank 
went into the shed, came out al- 
most immediately, strode down to 
the sagging chicken house. 

Enoch stood and waited, the 
rifle cradled on his arm. 

He had trouble here, he knew 
— more trouble than he’d ever 
had before. There was no such 
thing as reasoning with a man of 
Hank Fisher’s stripe. There was 
no approach, right now, that he 
would understand. All that he 



could do was to wait until Hank's 
temper had cooled off. Then there 
might be an outside chance of 
talking sense to him. 

The two of them came back. 

“She ain’t nowhere around,” 
said Hank. “She is in the house.” 

Enoch shook his head. “There 
can’t anyone get into that house." 

“Roy,” said Hank, “climb them 
there steps and open up that 
door.” 

Roy looked fearfully at Enoch. 

“Go ahead,” said Enoch. 

Roy moved forward slowly and 
went up the steps. He crossed the 
porch and put his hand upon the 
front doorknob and turned. He 
tried again. He turned around. 

“Pa,” he said, “I can’t turn it. 
I can’t get it open.” 

“Hell,” said Hank, disgusted, 
“you can’t do an 3 ^hing.” 

Hank took the steps in two 
jumps, paced wrathfully across 
the porch. His'hand reached out 
and grasped the knob and 
wrenched at it powerfully. He 
tried again and yet again. He 
turned angrily to face Enoch. 

“What is going on here?” he 
yelled. 

“I told you,” Enoch said, “that 
you can’t get in.” 

“The hell I can’t!” roared Hank. 

T¥E tossed the whip to Roy and 
came down off the porch, 
striding over to the woodpile that 
stood beside the shed. He 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



121 



wrenched the heavy, double-bit- 
ted axe out of the chopping block. 

“Careful with that axe,” warned 
Enoch. “I’ve had it for a long 
time and I set a store by it.” 

Hank did not answer. He went 
up on the p>orch and squared off 
before the door. 

“Stand off,” he said to Roy. 
“Give me elbow room.” 

Roy backed away. 

“Wait a minute,” Enoch said. 
“You mean to chop down that 
door?” 

“You’re damned right I do.” 

Enoch nodded gravely. 

“Well?” asked Hank. 

“It’s all right with me if you 
want to try.” 

Hank took his stance, gripping 
the handle of the axe. The steel 
flashed swiftly, up over h« 
shoulder, then down in a driven 
blow. 

The edge of the steel struck 
the surface of the door and 
turned, deflected by the surface, 
changed its course, bouncing from 
the door. The blade came slicing 
down and back. It missed Hank’s 
spraddled leg by no more than an 
inch and the momentum of it 
spun him half around. 

He stood there, foolishly, arms 
outstretched, hands still gripping 
the handle of the axe. He stared 
at Enoch. 

“Try again,” invited Enoch. 

Rage flowed over Hank. His 
face was flushed with anger. 



“By God, I will!” he yelled. 

He squared off again and this 
time he swung the axe, not at 
the door, but at the window set 
beside the door. 

The blade struck and there 
was a high singing sound as pieces 
of sun-bright steel went flying 
through the air. 

Ducking away. Hank dropped 
the axe. It fell to the floor of the 
porch and bounced. One blade 
was broken, the metal sheared 
away in jagged breaks. The win- 
dow was intact. There was not a 
scratch upon it. 

Hank stood there for a mo- 
ment, staring at the broken axe, 
as if he could not quite believe 
what he saw. 

Silently he stretched out his 
hand and Roy put the bull whip 
in it. 

The two of them came down 
the stairs. 

They stopped at the bottom of 
them and looked at Enoch. 
Hank’s hand twitched on the 
whip. 

“If I were you,” said Enoch, 
“I wouldi^’t try it. Hank. I can 
move awfully fast.” 

He patted the gun butt. “I’d 
have the hand off you before you 
could swing that whip.” 

Hank breathed heavily. 
“There’s the devil in you, Wal- 
lace,” he said. “And there’s the 
devil in her, too. You’re working 
together, the two of you. Sneak- 



ing around in the woods, meeting 
one another.” 

Enoch waited, watching the 
both of them. 

“God help me,” cried Hank. 
“My own daughter is a witch!” 

“I think,” said Enoch, “you 
should go back home. If I happen 
to find Lucy, I will bring her 
there.” 

Neither of them made a move. 

“You haven’t heard the last of 
this,” yelled Hank. ‘Y’ou have my 
daughter somewhere and I’ll get 
you for it.” 

“Any time you want,” said 
Enoch, “but not now.” 

He made an imperative ges- 
ture with the rifle barrel. 

“Get moving,” he said. “And 
don’t come back. Either one of 
you.” 

They hesitated for a moment, 
looking at him, trying to gauge 
him, trying to guess what he 
might do next. 

Slowly they turned and, walk- 
ing side by side, moved off down 
the hill. 

XV 

¥TE should have killed both of 
them, he thought. They were 
not fit to live. 

He glanced down at the rifle. 
His hands had such a grip on the 
gun that his fingers stood out 
white and stiff against the satin 
brown of the wood. 



He gasped a little in his effort 
to fight down the rage that boiled 
inside him, trying to explode. If 
they had stayed here any longer 
he’d have given in to that tower- 
ing rage. 

Even as it stood, it would be 
bad. They would say he was a 
madman; that he had run them 
off at gunpoint. They might even 
say that he had kidnaped Lucy 
and was holding her against her 
will. They would stop at nothing 
to make him all the trouble that 
they could. 

He had no illusions about what 
they might do, for he knew the 
breed, vindictive in their small- 
ness — little vicious insects of 
the human race. 

He stood beside the porch and 
watched them down the hill, 
wondering how a girl so fine as 
Lucy could spring from such de- 
cadent stock. Perhaps her handi- 
cap had kept her from becoming 
another one of them. Perhaps if 
she could have talked with them 
or listened, she would in time 
have become as shiftless and as 
vicious as any one of them. 

It had been a great mistake to 
get mixed up in a thing like this. 
A man in his position had too 
much to lose. 

And yet what could he have 
done? Could he have refused to 
give Lucy his protection, with the 
blood soaking through her dress 
from the lashes that lay across 



122

her shoulders? Should he have 
ignored the frantic, helpless 
pleading in her face? 

He turned heavily around and 
went back inside the station. 

L ucy was still sitting on the 
sofa. She held a flashing ob- 
ject in her hand, staring at it 
raptly. Her face again held that 
same vibrant and alert expression 
he had seen that morning when 
she’d held the butterfly. 

He laid the rifle on the desk 
and stood quietly there, but she 
must have caught the motion of 
him. She looked quickly up. Then 
her eyes went back to the flashing 
thing in her hands. 

It was the pyramid of spheres. 
Now all the spheres were spin- 
ning slowly, in alternating clock- 
wise and counterclockwise mo- 
tions. As they spun they shone 
and glittered, each in its own par- 
ticular color, as if there might be, 
deep inside each one of them, a 
source of soft, warm light. 

Enoch caught his breath at the 
beauty and the wonder of it 
the old, hard wonder of what this 
thing might be and what it might 
be meant to do. He had puzzled 
at it a hundred times or more. He 
could find nothing significant. So 
far as he could see, it was only 
meant to look at, although there 
had been that persistent feeling 
of purpose — that, perhaps, some- 
how, it was meant to operate. 



And now it was in operation. 

He had tried it a hundred 
times; Lucy had picked it up 
just once; and she had got it 
figured out. 

He noticed the rapture on her 
face. Was it possible that she 
knew its purpose? 

He went across the room and 
touched her arm. She lifted her 
face to look at him, and in her 
eyes he saw the gleam of happi- 
ness and excitement. 

He made a questioning gesture 
toward the pyramid, trying to ask 
if she knew what it might be. But 
she did not understand him. Or 
perhaps she knew, but knew as 
well how impossible it would be 
to explain its purpose. She made 
that happy, fluttery motion with 
her hand again, indicating the 
table with its load of gadgets. 
There was laughter in her face. 

Just a kid, Enoch told himself, 
with a box heaped high with new 
and wondrous toys. 

Was that all it was to her? Was 
she happy and excited merely be- 
cause she suddenly had become 
aware of all the beauty and the 
novelty of the things stacked 
there on the table? 

He turned wearily and went 
back to the desk. He picked up 
the rifle and hung it on the pegs. 

S HE should not be in the sta- 
tion. No human being other 
than himself should ever be in- 



side the station. Bringing her 
here, he had broken that un- 
spoken understanding he had 
with the aliens who had installed 
him as a keeper. Although, of all 
humans, Lucy was the one who 
could possibly be exempt from 
the restriction. For she could 
never tell the things that she had 
seen. 

She could not remain. She 
must be taken home. Otherwise 
there would be a massive hunt 
for her, a lost girl — a beautiful 
deaf-mute. 

A story like that would bring 
in newspapermen in a day or 
two. The woods would be swarm- 
ing with searchers. 

Hank Fisher would tell how 
he’d tried to break into the house 
and couldn’t. Then others would 
try to break in and there’d be hell 
to pay. 

Enoch sweated, thinking of 
it. 

All the years of keeping out of 
people’s way would be for noth- 
ing then. This strange house on 
a lonely ridge would become an 
international mystery, and a chal- 
; lenging target for all the crack- 
pots of the world. 

He went to the medicine cab- 
inet, to get the healing ointment 
that had been included in the 
drug packet provided by Galactic 
Central. 

He opened the little box. More 
than half of it remained. He’d 



used it through the years, but 
sparingly. There was, in fact, little 
need to use a great deal of it. 

He went across the room to 
Lucy, showed her what he had 
and made motions to show her 
what it was for. She slid her dress 
off her shoulders and he bent to 
look at the slashes. 

The bleeding had stopped, but 
the flesh was red and angry. 

Gently he rubbed pintment 
into the stripes that the whip had 
made. 

She had healed the butterfly, 
he thought; but she could not 
heal herself. 

On the table in front of her 
the pyramid of spheres still was 
flashing and glinting, throwing a 
flickering shadow of color all 
about the room. 

It was operating, but what 
could it be doing? 

XVI 

T TLYSSES came as twilight was 
deepening into night. 

Enoch and Lucy had just fin- 
ished with their supper and were 
sitting at the table when Enoch 
heard his footsteps. 

The alien stood in shadow and 
he looked, Enoch thought, more 
than ever like the cruel clown. 
His lithe, flowing body had the 
look of smoked, tanned buckskin. 
The patchwork color of his hide 
seemed to shine faintly; the hard 



124

angles of his face, the bald head, 
the flat, pointed ears pasted tight 
against the skull, lent him a vi- 
cious fearsomeness. 

If one did not know him for 
the gentle character that he was, 
Enoch told himself, he would be 
enough to scare a man out of 
seven years of growth. 

“We had been expecting you,” 
said Enoch. “The coffee pot is 
boiling.” 

Ulysses took a slow step for- 
ward, then paused. 

“You have another with you. 
A human, I would say.” 

“There is no danger,” Enoch 
told him. 

“Of another gender. A female, 
is it not? You have found a 
mate?” 

“No,” said Enoch. “She is not 
my mate.” 

“You have acted wisely 
through the years,” Ulysses told 
him. “In a position such as yours, 
a mate is not the best.” 

“You need not worry. There is 
a malady upon her. She has no 
communication. She can neither 
hear nor speak.” 

“A malady?” 

“Yes, from the moment she was 
bom. She has never heard or 
spoken. She can tell of nothing 
here.” 

“Sign language?” 

“She knows no sign language. 
She refused to learn it.” 

“She is a friend of yours.” 



“For some years,” said Enoch. 
“She came seeking my protection. 
Her father used a whip to beat 
her.” 

“This father knows she’s here?” 

“He thinks she is. But he can- 
not know.” 

Ulysses came slowly out of the 
darkness and stood within the 
light. 

Lucy was watching him. There 
was no terror on her face. Her 
eyes were level and untroubled 
and she did not flinch. 

“She takes me well,” Ulysses 
said. “She does not run or 
scream.” 

“She could not scream,” said 
Enoch, “even if she wished.” 

MUST be most repugnant," 
Ulysses said, “at first sight 
to any human.” 

“She does not see the outside 
only. She sees inside of you as 
well.” 

‘Would she be frightened if I 
made a human bow to her?” 

“I think,” said Enoch, “she 
might be very pleased.” 

Ulysses made his bow, formal 
and exaggerated, with one hand 
upon his leathery belly, bowing 
from the waist. 

Lucy smiled and clapped her 
hands. 

“You see?” Ulysses cried, de- 
lighted. “I think that she may 
like me.” 

‘Why don’t you sit down, 



then,” suggested Enoch, “and we 
all will have some coffee.” 

“I had forgotten of the coffee. 
The sight of this other human 
drove coffee from my mind.” 

He sat down at the place where 
the third cup had been set, wait- 
ing for him. Enoch started around 
the table, but Lucy rose and went 
to get the coffee. 

“She understands?” Ulysses 
asked. 

Enoch shook his head. “You sat 
down by the cup and the cup was 
empty.” 

She poured the coffee, then 
went over to the sofa. 

“She will not stay with us?” 
Ulysses asked. 

“She’s intrigued by that table 
full of trinkets. She set one of 
them to going.” 

“You plan to keep her here?” 
“I can’t keep her,” Enoch said. 
“There’ll be a hunt for her. I’ll 
have to take her home.” 

“I do not like it,” Ulysses said. 
“Nor do I. Let’s admit at once 
that I should not have brought 
her here. But at the time it 
seemed the only thing to do. I 
had no time to think it out.” 
“You’ve done no wrong,” said 
Ulysses, softly. 

“She cannot harm us,” said 
Enoch. ‘Without communication 
of any kind . .” 

“It’s not that,” Ulysses told 
him. “She's just a complication 
and I do not like further compli- 



cations. I came tonight to tell 
you, Enoch, that we are in 
trouble.” 

“Trouble? But there’s not been 
any trouble.” 

Ulysses lifted his coffee cup and 
took a long drink of it. 

“That is good,” he said. “I carry 
back the bean and make it at my 
home. But it does not taste the 
same.” 

“This trouble?” 

“You remember the Vegan 
that died here several of your 
years ago.” 

Enoch nodded. “The Hazer.” 

“The being has a proper name 
of his own . .” 

Enoch laughed. “You* don’t 
like our nicknames.” 

“It is not our way,” Ulysses 
said. 

“My name for them,” said 
Enoch, “is a mark of my affec- 
tion.” 

“You buried this Vegan.” 

“In my family plot,” said 
Enoch. “As if he were my own. I 
read a verse above him.” 

“That is well and good,” Ulys- 
ses said. “That is as it should be. 
But the body’s gone.” 

6Ci^ONE! It can’t be gone!” 
cried Enoch. 

“It has been taken from the 
grave.” 

“But you can’t know,” pro- 
tested Enoch. “How could you 
know?” 



126 



GALAXY 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



127 



“Not I. The Vegans are the 
ones who know.” 

“But they’re light years distant 
from here . 

And then he was not too sure. 
For on that night the wise old one 
had died and he’d messaged Galac- 
tic Central he had been told that 
the Vegans had known the mo- 
ment he had died. And there had 
been no need for a death certifi- 
cate, for they knew of what he 
died. 

It seemed impossible, of course. 
But there were too many impos- 
sibilities in the galaxy — which 
turned out, after all, to be entirely 
possible — for a man to ever 
know when he stood on solid 
ground. 

Was it possible, he wondered, 
that each Vegan had some sort of 
mental contact with every other 
Vegan? Or that some central cen- 
sus bureau (to give a human des- 
ignation to something that was 
scarcely understandable) might 
have some sort of official linkage 
with every living Vegan, knowing 
where it was and how it was and 
what it might be doing? 

Something of the sort, Enoch 
admitted, might indeed be pos- 
sible. It was not beyond the as- 
tounding capabilities that one 
found on every hand throughout 
the galaxy. But to maintain a 
similar contact with the Vegan 
dead was something else again. 

“The body’s gone," Ulysses 



said. “I can tell you that and 
know it is the truth. You’re held 
accountable.” 

“By the Vegans?” 

“By the Vegans, yes. And the 
galaxy.” 

“I. did what I could!” said 
Enoch hotly. “I did what was re- 
quired. I filled the letter of the 
Vegan law. I paid the dead my 
honor and the honor of my planet. 
It is not right that the respon- 
sibility should go on forever. Not 
that I can believe the body can 
be really gone. There is no one 
who would take it. No one knew 
of it!” 

“By human logic,” Ulysses told 
him, “you, of course, are right 
But not by Vegan logic. And in 
this case Galactic Central would 
tend to support the Vegans.” 

Enoch said testily, “The Ve- 
gans happen to be friends of 
mine. I have never met one of 
them that I didn’t like or couldn’t 
get along with. I can work it out 
with them.” 

“If only the Vegans were con- 
cerned,” said Ulysses, “I am quite 
sure you could. But the situation 
is complicated. The Vegans have 
known for some time that the 
body had been taken. They were 
disturbed, of course, but out of 
certain considerations, they kept 
their silence.” 

“They needn’t have. They 
could have come to me. I don’t 
know what could have been done 




. but I would have tried to do 
^mething." 

“Silent not because of you. Be- 
cause of something else.” 

TTLYSSES finished off his cof- 
^ fee and poured himself an- 
other cup. He filled Enoch’s half- 
filled cup and set the pot aside. 

Enoch waited. 

“You may not have been aware 
of it,” said Ulysses, “but at the 
time this station was established, 
there was considerable opposition 
to it from a number of races in 
the galaxy. There were many 
leasons cited, as is the case in all 
such situations, but the underly- 
ing reason, when you get down 
to basics, rest squarely on the 
continual contest for racial or re- 
gional advantage.” 

Enoch nodded. “I had a hint of 
this. I hadn’t paid much attention 
to it.” 

“It’s largely a matter of direc- 
tion,” Ulysses said. “When Galac- 
tic Central began its expansion 
into this spiral arm, it meant 
there was no time or effort avail- 
able for expansions in other di- 
rections. There is one large 
group of races which has held a 
dream for many centuries of ex- 
panding into some of the nearby 
globular clusters. It does make a 
dim sort of sense, of course. With 
the techniques that we have, the 
longer jump across space to some 
of the closer clusters is entirely 



possible. Another thing. The 
clusters seem to be extraordinar- 
ily free of dust and gas; so that 
once we got there, we could ex- 
pand more rapidly throughout the 
cluster than we can in many parts 
of the galaxy. But, at best, it’s a 
speculative business, for we don’t 
know what we’ll find there. After 
we’ve made all the effort and 
spent all the time we may find 
little or nothing, except, possibly, 
some more real estate. And we 
have plenty of that in the galaxy. 
But the clusters have a vast ap- 
peal for certain types of minds.” 

Enoch nodded. “I can see that. 
It would be the first venturing out 
of the galaxy itself. It might be 
the first short step on the route 
that could lead us to other gal- 
axies.” 

Ulysses peered at him. “You, 
too,” he said. “I might have 
known.” 

Enoch said, smugly: “I am that 
type of mind.” 

a Vj^ELL, anyhow,” he said, 
“there was this globular- 
cluster faction — I suppose you’d 
call it that — which contended 
bitterly when we began our move 
in this direction. You understand 
that we’ve barely begun the ex- 
pansion into this neighborhood. 
We have less than a dozen sta- 
tions; we’ll need a hundred. It 
will take centuries before the net- 
work is complete.” 



128 



GALAXY 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



129 



“So this faction is still contend- 
ing,” Enoch said. “There still is 
time to stop this spiral-arm proj- 
ect.” 

“That is right. And that’s what 
worries me. For the faction is set 
to use this incident of the missing 
body as an emotion-charged argu- 
ment against the extension of this 
network. It is being joined by 
other groups that are concerned 
with certain special interests. And 
these special interest groups see 
a better chance of getting what 
they want if they can wreck this 
project.” 

“Wreck it?” 

“Yes, wreck it. They will start 
screaming, as soon as the body in- 
cident becomes open knowledge, 
that a planet so barbaric as the 
Earth is no fit location for a sta- 
tion. They will insist that this 
station be abandoned.” 

“But they can’t do that!” 

“They can,” Ulysses said. 
“They will say it is degrading and 
unsafe to maintain a station so 
barbaric that even graves are 
rifled, on a planet where the 
honored dead cannot rest in 
peace. It is the kind of highly 
emotional argument that will 
gain wide acceptance and support 
in some sections of the galaxy. 
The Vegans tried their best. They 
tried to hush it up, for the sake 
of the project. They have never 
done a thing like that before. 
They are a proud people and they 



feel a slight to honor perhaps 
more deeply than many other 
races. Yet, for the greater good, 
they were willing to accept dis- 
honor. And would have if they 
could have kept it quiet. But the 
story leaked out somehow — by 
good espionage, no doubt. And 
they cannot stand the loss of face 
in advertised dishonor. The Ve- 
gan who will be arriving here this 
evening is an official representa- 
tive charged with delivering an 
official protest.” 

“To me?” 

“To you, and through you to 
the Earth.” 

“But the Earth is not con- 
cerned. The Earth doesn’t even 
know.” 

“Of course it doesn’t. So far as 
Galactic Central is concerned, 
you are the Earth. You represent 
the Earth.” 

Enoch shook his head. It was 
a crazy way of thinking. But, he 
told himself, he should not be 
surprised. It was the kind of 
thinking he should have expected. 
He was too hidebound, he 
thought, too narrow. 

“But even if you have to aban- 
don Earth,” he said, “you could go 
out to Mars and build a station 
there.” 

“You don’t understand,” Ulys- 
ses told him. “This station is no 
more than a toehold. The aim is 
to wreck the project. If they can 
force us to abandon one station. 



130 



GALAXY 



then we stand discredited. Then 
all our judgments come up for 
review.” 

4i¥>UT even if the project 
-■-'should be wrecked,” Enoch 
pointed out, “there is no surety 
that any group would gain. It 
would only throw the question of 
where the time and energy should 
be used into an open debate. You 
say that there are many special- 
interest factions banding togeth- 
er to carry on the fight against 
us. Suppose they do win. Then 
they must turn around and start 
fighting among themselves.’” 

“Of course,” Ulysses admitted, 
“but then each of them has a 
chance. The way it is they have 
no chance at all. There is one 
group on the far side of the gal- 
axy that wants to move out into 
the thinly populated sections of 
one particular section of the rim. 
They still believe in an ancient 
legend which says that their race 
arose as the result of immigrants 
from another galaxy who landed 
on the rim and worked their way 
inward over many galactic years. 
They think that if they can get 
out to the rim they can turn that 
legend into history to their great- 
er glory . Another group wants 
to go into a small spiral arm be- 
cause of an obscure record that 
many eons ago their ancestors 
picked up some virtually undeci- 
pherable messages which they be- 



lieved came from that direction. 
Through the years the story has 
grown, until today they are con- 
vinced a race of intellectual 
giants will be found in that spiral 
arm. And there is always pres- 
sure to probe deeper into the 
galactic core. You must realize 
that we have only started. The 
galaxy still is largely unexplored. 
The thousands of races who form 
Galactic Central still are pio- 
neers.” 

“You sound,” said Enoch, “as 
if you have little hope of main- 
taining this station.” 

“Almost no hope at all,” Ulys- 
ses told him. “But so far as you 
yourself are concerned, there will 
be an option. You can stay here 
and live out an ordinary life on 
Earth or you can be assigned to 
another station. Galactic Central 
hopes that you would elect to 
continue on with us.” 

Enoch sat numb and stricken. 
Bad news! It was worse than that. 
It was the crashing down of not 
only his own personal world, but 
of all the hopes of Earth. With 
the station gone. Earth once more 
would be left in the backwaters 
of the galaxy, with no hope of 
help, no chance of recognition, 
no realization of what lay wait- 
ing in the galaxy. Standing alone 
and naked, the human race would 
go on in its same old path, fum- 
bling its uncertain way toward 
a blind, mad future.

Hazer was elderly. The 
golden haze that enveloped 
him had lost the sparkle of 
its yoruthfulness. It was a mellow 
glow, deep and rich — not the 
blinding haze of a younger be- 
ing. He carried himself with a 
solid dignity and the flaring 
topknot that was neither hair nor 
feathers was a saintly white. His 



face was soft and tender, the soft- 
ness and the tenderness which in 
a man might have been expressed 
in kindly wrinkles. 

“I am sorry,” he told Enoch, 
“that our meeting must be such 
as this. Although, under any cir- 
cumstances, I am glad to meet 
you. I have heard of you. It is 
not often that a being of an out- 
side planet is the keeper of a 
station. Because of this, young be-

know there were two of them. I 
only knew of one.” 

“It’s a friend of Enoch’s,” Ulys- 
ses said. 

“There has been contact, then; 
Contact with the planet.” 

“No, there has been no con- 
tact.” 

“Perhaps an indiscretion.” 

“Perhaps,” Ulysses said, “but 
under provocation that I doubt 
either you or I could have stood 
against.” 

Lucy had risen to her feet and 
now she came across the room, 
moving quietly and slowly, as if 
she might be floating. 

The Hazer spoke to her in the 
common tongue. “I am very glad 
to meet you.” 

“She cannot speak,” Ulysses 
said. “She has no communica- 
tion.” 

“Compensation,” said the Ha- 
zer. 

“You think so?” asked Ulys- 
ses. 

“I am sure of it.” 

He walked slowly forward and 
Lucy waited. 

“It — she, the female form, you 
called it — she is not afraid.” 

Ulysses chuckled. “Not even of 
me,” he said. 

The Hazer reached out his 
hand to her and she stood quietly 
for a moment, then one hand 
came up and took the Hazer’s 
fingers, more like tentacles than 
fingers, in her grasp. 



ing, I have been intrigued with 
you. I have wondered what sort 
of creature you might turn out 
to be.” 

“You need have no apprehen- 
sion of him,” Ulysses said, a little 
sharply. “I will vouch for him. 
We have been friends for years.” 
“Yes, I forgot,” the Hazer said. 
‘You are his discoverer.” 

He peered around the room. 
“Another one,” he said. “I did not

I T seemed to Enoch that the 
cloak of golden haze reached 
out to wrap the Earth girl in its 
glow. Enoch blinked and the il- 
lusion, if it had been illusion, was 
swept away; only the Hazer had 
the golden cloak. 

And how was it, Enoch won- 
dered, that there was no fear in 
her, either of Ulysses or the Ha- 
zer? Was it because she could see 
beyond the outward guise to 
sense their basic humanity? (God 
help me, I cannot think, even 
now, except in human terms! ) 
And if that were true, was it be- 
cause she, herself, was not en- 
tirely human? 

Lucy dropped the Hazer’s hand 
and went back to the sofa. 

The Hazer said: “Enoch Wal- 
lace.” 

“Yes.” 

“She is of your race?” 

“Yes, of course.” 

“She is most unlike you. Al- 
most as if there were two races 
on your planet.” 

“There is only one.” 

“Are there many others like 
her?” 

“I would not know,” said 
Enoch. 

“Coffee,” said Ulysses to the 
Hazer. “Would you like some 
coffee?” 

“Coffee?” 

“A most delicious brew. Earth’s 
one great accomplishment.” 

“I am not acquainted with it,” 



said the Hazer. “I don’t believe I 
will.” 

He turned ponderously to 
Enoch. 

“You know why I am here?” 
he asked. “It is a matter I regret, 
but I must . 

“If you’d rather,” Enoch said, 
“we can consider that the protest 
has been made. I would so stipu- 
late.” 

“Why not?” Ulysses said. 
“There is no need, it seems to 
me, to have the three of us go 
through a somewhat painful 
scene.” 

The Hazer hesitated. 

“If you feel you must,” said 
Enoch. 

“No,” the Hazer said. “I am 
satisfied if an unspoken protest 
be generously accepted.” 

“Accepted,” Enoch said, “on 
just one condition. That I satisfy 
myself that the charge is not un- 
founded. I must go out and see.” 

“You do not believe me?” 

“It is not a matter of belief. It 
is something that can be checked. 
I cannot accept either for myself 
or for my planet until I have 
done that much.” 

“Enoch,” Ulysses said, “the Ve- 
gan has been gracious. Not only 
now, but before this happened. 
His race presses the charge most 
reluctantly. They suffered much 
to protect the Earth and you.” 

“And the feeling is that I would 
be ungracious if I did not accept 



134 



GALAXY 



the protest and the charge on the 
Vegan statement.” 

“I am sorry, Enoch,” said Ulys- 
ses. “That is what I mean.” 

"C’NOCH shook his head. “For 
years I’ve tried to under- 
stand and to conform to the 
ethics and ideas of all the people 
who have come through this sta- 
tion. I’ve pushed my own human 
instincts and training to one side. 
I’ve tried to understand other 
viewpoints and to evaluate other 
ways of thinking, many of which 
did violence to my own. I am 
glad of all of it, for it has given 
me a chance to go beyond the 
narrowness of Earth. I think I 
gained something from it all. But 
none of this touched Earth; only 
myself was involved. This busi- 
ness touches Earth and I must 
approach it from an Earthman’s 
viewpoint. In this particular in- 
stance I am not simply the keeper 
of a galactic station.” 

Neither of them said a word. 
Enoch stood waiting and still 
there was nothing said. 

Finally he turned and headed 
for the door. 

“I’ll be back,” he told them. 

He spoke the phrase and the 
door started to slide open. 

“If you’ll have me,” said Hazer, 
quietly, “I’d like to go with you.” 
“Fine,” said Enoch. “Come 
ahead.” 

It was dark outside and Enoch 



lit the lantern. The Hazer 
watched him closely. 

“Fossil fuel,” Enoch told him. 
“It burns at the tip of a saturated 
wick.” 

The Hazer said, in horror: 
“But surely you have better.” 

“Much better now. I am just 
old-fashioned.” 

He led the way outside, the 
lantern throwing a small pool of 
light. The Hazer followed. 

“It is a wild planet,” said the 
Hazer. 

“Wild here. There are parts of 
it are tame.” 

“My own planet is controlled,” 
the Hazer said. “Every foot of it 
is planned.” 

“I know. I have talked to many 
Vegans. They described the plan- 
et to me.” 

They headed for the barn. 

“You want to go back?” asked 
Enoch. 

“No,” said the Hazer. “I find 
it exhilarating. Those are wild 
plants over there?” 

“We call them trees,” said 
Enoch. 

“The wind blows as it wishes?” 

“That’s right,” said Enoch. “We 
do not as yet control the weather.” 

The spade stood just inside the 
barn door and Enoch picked it 
up. He headed for the orchard. 

“You know, of course,” the 
Hazer said, “the body will be 
gone.” 

“I’m prepared to find it gone.” 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



135 



“Then why?” the Hazer asked. 

“Because I must be sure. You 
can’t understand that, can you?” 

“You said back there in the 
station,’’ the Hazer said, “that you 
tried to understand the rest of 
us. Perhaps, for a change, at least 
one of us should try understand- 
ing you.” 

l^NOCH led the way down the 
path through the orchard. 
They came to the rude fence en- 
closing the burial plot. The sag- 
ging gate stood open. Enoch went 
through it and the Hazer fol- 
lowed. 

“This is where you buried 
him?” 

“This is my family plot. My 
mother and my father are here 
and I put him with them.” 

He handed the lantern to the 
Vegan and, armed with the spade, 
walked up to the grave. He thrust 
the spade into the ground. 

“Would you hold the lantern 
a little closer, please?” 

The Hazer moved up a step or 
two. 

Enoch dropped to his knees 
and brushed away the leaves that 
had fallen on the ground. Under- 
neath them was the soft, fresh 
earth that had been newly turned. 
There was a depression and a 
small hole at the bottom of the 
depression. As he brushed at the 
earth, he could hear the clods of 
displaced dirt falling through the 



hole and striking on something 
that was not the soil. 

The Hazer had moved the lan- 
tern again and he could not see. 
But he did not need to see. He 
knew there was no use of digging; 
he knew what he would find. He 
should have kept a watch. He 
should not have put up the stone 
to attract attention. But Galactic 
Central had said “as if he were 
your own,” and that was the way 
he’d done it. 

He felt the damp of the earth 
soaking through his trousers. 

“No one told me,” said the 
Hazer softly. 

“Told you what?” 

“The memorial. And what is 
written on it. I was not aware 
that you knew our language.” 

“I learned it long ago. There 
were scrolls I wished to read. 
I’m afraid it’s not too good.” 

“Two misspelled words,” the 
Hazer told him, “and one little 
awkwardness. But those are 
things which do not matter. What 
matters, very much, is that when 
you wrote you thought as one of 
us.” 

Enoch rose and reached out for 
the lantern. 

“Let’s go back,” he said sharply. 
“I know now who did this. I have 
to hunt him out.” 

^T^HE treetops far above moaned 
in the rising wind. Ahead, 
the great clump of canoe birch 



136 



GALAXY 



showed whitely in the dim glow 
of the lantern’s light. The birch 
clump, Enoch knew, grew on the 
lip of a small cliff that dropped 
twenty feet or more and here one 
turned to the right to get around 
it and continue down the hillside. 

Enoch turned slightly and 
glanced at Lucy, following close 
behind. She smiled at him. He 
gestured to indicate that they 
must turn to the right, that she 
must follow closely. Although it 
wasn’t necessary; she knew the 
hillside better than he himself. 

He turned along the edge of 
the cliff, came to the break and 
clambered down to reach the 
slope below. Off to the left he 
could hear the swiftly-running 
creek that tumbled down the ra- 
vine from the spring below the 
field. 

The hillside plunged more 
steeply now and he led a way 
that angled across it. 

Even in the darkness he could 
recognize the white oak that 
twisted at a crazy angle above the 
hill; the small grove of massive 
red oaks that grew out of a dome 
of tumbled rock, so placed that 
no axeman had even tried to cut 
them down; the tiny swamp, filled 
with cattails, that fitted itself 
snugly into a little terrace carved 
into the hillside. 

Far below he caught the gleam 
of window light. 

They came to a rude fence of 



poles and crawled through it. 
Now the ground became more 
level. Somewhere a dog barked in 
the dark and another joined him. 
More joined in, and the pack 
came sweeping up toward them. 
They arrived in a rush of feet, 
veered around Enoch and the 
lantern to launch themselves at 
Lucy — suddenly transformed, 
at the sight of her, into a wel- 
coming committee rather than a 
company of guards. Enoch led 
the way across a vegetable gar- 
den carefully following a path be- 
tween the rows. Then they were 
in the yard and the house stood 
before them, a tumbledown, sag- 
ging structure, its kitchen win- 
dows glowing with lamplight. 

T he door opened. Ma Fisher 
stood framed against the 
light, a great, tall, bony woman 
clothed in something that was 
more sack than dress. 

She stared at Enoch, half 
frightened, half belligerent. Then 
back of him she saw the girl. 
“Lucy!” she cried. 

The girl came forward with a 
rush and her mother caught her 
in her arms. 

Enoch set his lantern on the 
ground, tucked the rifle under- 
neath his arm and stepped across 
the threshold. 

The family had been at supper, 
seated about a great round table 
set in the center of the kitchen. 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



137 



An ornate oil lamp stood in the 
center of the table. Hank had 
risen to his feet, but his three 
sons and the stranger still were 
seated. 

“So you brung her back,” said 
Hank. 

“I found her,” Enoch said. 

“We quit hunting for her just 
a while ago,” Hank told him. “We 
was going out again.” 

“You remember what you told 
me this afternoon?” asked Enoch. 

“I told you a lot of things.” 

“You told me that I had the 
devil in me. Raise your hand 
against that girl once more and 
I promise you I’ll show you just 
how much devil there is in me.” 

“You can’t bluff me,” Hank 
blustered. 

But the man was frightened. It 
showed in the limpness of his 
face, the tightness of his body. 

“I mean it,” Enoch said. “Just 
try me out and see.” 

The two men stood for a mo- 
ment, facing one another, then 
Hank sat down. 

“Would you join us in some 
victuals?” he inquired. 

Enoch shook his head. 

He looked at the stranger. “Are 
you the ginseng man?” he asked. 

The man nodded. “That is 
what they call me.” 

“I want to talk with you. Out- 
side.” 

Claude Lewis stood up. 

“You don’t have to go,” said 



Hank. “He can’t make you go. 
He can talk to you right here.” 
“I don’t mind,” said Lewis. “In 
fact, I want to talk with him. 
You’re Enoch Wallace, aren’t 
you?” 

“That’s who he is,” said Hank. 
“Should of died of old age fifty 
years ago. But look at him. He’s 
got the devil in him. I tell you, 
him and the devil has a deal.” 
“Hank,” Lewis said, “shut up.” 
Lewis came around the table 
and went out the door. 

“Good night,” Enoch said to 
the rest of them. 

“Mr. Wallace,” said Ma Fish- 
er, “thanks for bringing back my 
girl. Hank won’t hit her again, I 
can promise you. I’ll see to that.” 
Enoch went outside and shut 
the door. He picked up the lan- 
tern. Lewis was out in the yard. 
Enoch went to him. 

“Let’s walk off a ways,” he 
said. 

^HEY stopped at the edge of 
the garden and turned to 
face one another. 

“You been watching me,” said 
Enoch. 

Lewis nodded. 

“Official? Or just snooping?” 
“Official, I’m afraid. My name 
is Claude Lewis. There is no rea- 
son I shouldn’t tell you. I’m CIA.” 
“I’m not a traitor or a spy,” 
Enoch said. 

“No one thinks you are. We’re 



138 



GALAXY 



just watching you. You can 
imagine why, I expect.” 

“You know about the ceme- 
tery?” 

Lewis nodded. 

1 “You took something from a 
i grave.” 

I “Yes,” said Lewis. “The one 
{ with the funny headstone.” 

, “Where is it?” 

I “You mean the body. It’s in 
1 Washington.” 

“You shouldn’t have taken it,” 
i Enoch said, grimly. “You’ve 
caused a lot of trouble. You have 
to get it back as quickly as you 
can.” 

“It will take a little time,” said 
Lewis. “They’ll have to fly it out. 
Twenty-four hours, maybe.” 

“That’s the fastest you can 
make it?” 

“I might do a little better.” 

“Do the very best you can. It’s 
important that you get that body 
back.” 

“I will, Wallace. I didn’t know 
it would be important.” 

“And, Lewis.” 

“Yes.” 

“Don’t try to play it smart. 
Don’t add any frills. Just do what 
I tell you. I’m trying to be reason- 
I able because that’s the only thing 
i to be. But you try one smart 
move . .” 

He reached out a hand and 
grabbed Lewis’ shirt front, twist- 
ing the fabric tight. “You under- 
stand me, Lewis?” 



Lewis was unmoved. He did 
not try to pull away. “I had a 
job,” he said. 

“Yeah, a job. Watching me. 
Not robbing graves.” He let loose 
of the shirt. 

“Tell me,” said Lewis, “that 
thing in the grave. What was it?” 

“That’s none of your damn 
business,” Enoch told him, bitter- 
ly. “Getting back that body is. 
It’s most important thing you’ve 
ever done. Don’t forget that for 
a minute. It affects everyone on 
Earth. You and I and everyone. 
And if you fail, you’ll answer to 
me for it.” 

“Wallace, is there something 
you can tell me?” 

“Not a thing,” said Enoch. He 
picked up the lantern, turned, 
went across the garden and 
started up the hill. 

In the yard, Lewis stood for a 
long time, watching the lantern 
bobbing out of sight.

U LYSSES was alone in the 
station when Enoch returned. 
He had sent the Thuban on his 
way and the Hazer back to Vega. 

A fresh pot of coffee was brew- 
ing and Ulysses was sprawled out 
on the sofa, doing nothing. 

Enoch hung up the rifle and 
blew out the lantern. Taking off 
his jacket, he threw it on the 
desk. He sat down in a chair

across from the sofa. 

“The body will be back,” he 
said, “by this time tomorrow.” 

“I sincerely hope,” Ulysses 
said, “that it will do some good. 
But I’m inclined to doubt it.” 
Said Enoch bitterly, “Maybe 
I should not have bothered.” 

“It will show good faith,” 
Ulysses said. “It might have 
some mitigating effect in the 
final weighing.” 

. “The Hazer could have told 
me,” Enoch said, “where the body 
was. If he knew it had been taken 
from the grave, then he must have 
known where it could be found.” 
“I would suspect he did,” Ulys- 
ses said. “But, you see, he couldn’t 
tell you. All that he could do was 
to make his protest. The rest was 
up to you.” 

“Sometimes this business is 
enough to drive one crazy.” 

“There may come a day,” 
Ulysses said, “when it won’t be 
like that. I can look ahead and 
see, in some thousands of years, 
the knitting of the galaxy to- 
gether into one great culture, one 
huge area of understanding. The 
local and the racial variations 
still will exist, of course, and that 
is as it should be, but overriding 
all of these will be a tolerance 
that will make for what one might 
be tempted to call a brother- 
hood.” 

Enoch said, “You sound almost 
like a human.” • 



^¥^HE COFFEE pot was making 
sounds. Enoch went to get it. 
Ulysses had pushed some of the 
trinkets on the coffee table to one 
side to make room for two coffee 
cups. Enoch filled them and set 
the pot upon the floor. 

Ulysses picked up his cup, held 
it for a moment in his hands, 
then put it back on the table top. 

“We’re in bad shape,” he said. 
“Not like in the old days. It has 
Galactic Central worried. All this 
squabbling and haggling among 
the races, all the pushing and the 
shoving.” 

He looked at Enoch. “You 
thought it was all nice and cozy.” 
“No,” said Enoch, “not that. 
But I’m afraid I thought of the 
conflicts as being on a fairly lofty 
plane. Gentlemanly, you know. 
Good mannered.” 

“That was the way it was at 
one time. There always have been 
differing opinions, but they were 
based on principles and ethics, 
not on special interests. You know 
about the spiritual force, of 
course. The universal spiritual 
force.” 

Enoch nodded. “I’ve read some 
of the literature. I don’t quite un- 
derstand, but I’m willing to ac- 
cept it. There is a way, I know, 
to get in contact with the force.” 
“The Talisman,” said Ulysses. 
“That’s it. The Talisman. A ma- 
chine, of sorts.” 

“I suppose,” Ulysses agreed. 



“you could call it that. Although 
machine is a little awkward. More 
than sheer mechanics went into 
the making of it. There is just 
the one. Only one was ever made, 
by a being who lived ten thousand 
of your years ago. I wish I could 
tell you what it is or how it is 
constructed, but there is no one, 
I am afraid, who can tell you 
that. There have been others who 
have attempted to duplicate the 
: Talisman, but no one has suc- 
' ceeded. The mystic who made it 
left no blueprints, no plans, no 
specifications, not a single note. 
There is no one who knows any- 
thing about it.” 

“There is no reason, I suppose,” 
I said Enoch, “that another should 
not be made. No sacred taboos, 
I mean. To make another one 
j would not be sacrilegious.” 

“Not in the least,” Ulysses told 
him. “In fact, we need another 
badly. For now we have no Talis- 
man. It has disappeared.” 

Enoch jerked upright in his 
chair. 

“Disappeared?” he asked. 
“Lost,” said Ulysses. “Misplaced. 
Stolen. No one knows.” 

“But I hadn’t . .” 

Ulysses smiled bleakly. “It’s a 
' strange business,” he said. “The 
Talisman has been missing for 
several years or so, and no one 
knows about it — except Galac- 
tic Central and the — what would 
you call it? The hierarchy, I sup- 



pose. The organization of mystics. 
And yet, even with no one know- 
ing, the galaxy is beginning to 
show wear. It’s coming apart at 
the seams. In time to come, it may 
fall apart. As if the Talisman rep- 
resented a force that all unknow- 
ingly held the races of the galaxy 
together, exerting its influence 
even when it remained unseen.” 

“But even if it’s lost, it’s some- 
where,” Enoch pointed out. “It 
still would be exerting its influ- 
ence. It couldn’t have been de- 
stroyed.” 

“You forget,” Ulysses reminded 
him, “that without its proper cus- 
todian it is inoperative. The ma- 
chine merely acts as an inter- 
mediary between the sensitive 
and the force. It is an extension 
of the sensitive.” 

' I ’HEY SAT in silence for a 
moment, listening to the soft 
sound that the wind made as it 
blew through the gable ginger- 
bread. 

“You really think relations in 
the galaxy are deteriorating be- 
cause of this?” 

“Once,” Ulysses said, “the races 
all were bound together. There 
were differences, naturally, but 
these differences were bridged. 
Both sides wanted them bridged, 
you see. There was a common 
purpose, the forging of a great 
confraternity of all intelligences. 
We realized that among us we 



140 



GALAXY 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



141 



had a staggering fund of knowl- 
edge and techniques. Working to- 
gether, putting together all this 
knowledge and capability, we 
could arrive at something that 
would be far greater and more 
significant than any race, alone, 
could hope of accomplishing. We 
had our troubles and our differ- 
ences, but we were progressing. 
We brushed the small animosities 
and the petty differences under- 
neath the rug and worked only 
on the big ones. We felt that if 
we could get the big ones settled, 
the small ones would become so 
small they would disappear. But 
it is becoming different now. 
There is a tendency to pull the 
pettiness from underneath the rug 
and blow it beyond its size.” 

“It sounds like Earth,” said 
Enoch. 

“In many ways,” Ulysses said. 
“In principle, although the cir- 
cumstances would diverge im- 
mensely.” 

“You’ve been reading the pa- 
pers I have been saving for you?” 

Ulysses nodded. “It doesn’t 
look too happy.” 

“It looks like war,” said Enoch 
bluntly. 

Ulysses stirred uneasily. 

“You don’t have wars,” said 
Enoch. 

“The galaxy, you mean. No, as 
we are set up now we don’t have 
wars.” 

“Too civilized?” 



“Stop being bitter,” Ulysses told 
him. “There has been a time or 
two when we came very close, 
but not in recent years. There are 
many races now in the confra- 
ternity that in their formative 
years had a history of war.” 
“There is hope for us, then. 
It’s something you outgrow.” 

“In time, perhaps.” 

“But not a certainty?” 

“No, I wouldn’t say so.” 

“I’ve been working on a chart,” 
said Enoch. “Based on the Mizar 
system of statistics. The chart 
says there is going to be war.” 
“You don’t need the chart,” 
Ulysses said, “to tell you that.” 
“But there was something else. 
It was not just knowing if there’d 
be a war. I had hoped that the 
chart might show how to keep 
the peace. There must be a way. 
If we could only think of it or 
know where to look or whom to 
ask or . .” 

“There is a way,” Ulysses said 
“You mean you know . .” 

“It’s drastic. A last resort.” 

“And we’ve not reached that 
last resort?” 

“Perhaps you have. The kind 
of war that Earth would fight 
could spell an end to everything 
but the feeble remnants of civili- 
zations. It could, just possibly, 
eliminate life upon the planet.” 
“This method of yours — it has 
been used?” 

“A few times.” 



142 



GALAXY 



“And worked?” 

“Oh, certainly. We’d not even 
consider it if it didn’t work.” 

I “It could be used on Earth?” 

“You could apply for it.” 

“I?” 

“As a representative of the 
' Earth. To gain a hearing, you 
must know about Galactic Cen- 
tral and you’re the only man of 
Earth who does. BesideSj your 
record has been good. We would 
listen to you.” 

“But one man alone! One man 
can’t speak for an entire race. If 
I could consult some others — ” 

“Who would believe you?” 

“That’s true,” said Enoch. 

Of course it was. To him there 
was no longer any strangeness in 
the idea of a galactic confra- 
ternity, of a transportation net- 
work that spread among the stars 
— but tell it to any other Earth- 
man and it would sound like mad- 
ness. 

“And this method?” he asked, 
almost afraid to ask it. 

“Stupidity,” Ulysses said. 

l^NOCH gasped. “Stupidity? I 
^ don’t understand. We are stu- 
pid enough, in many ways, right 
now.” 

“You’re thinking of intellectual 
I stupidity. What I am talking 
I about is a mental incapacity. An 
j inability to understand the sci- 
lence and the technique that 
[makes possible the kind of war 



that Earth would fight. An in- 
ability to operate the machines 
that are necessary to fight that 
kind of war. Turning the people 
back to a mental position where 
they would not be able to com- 
prehend the mechanical and tech- 
nological and scientific advances 
they have made. Those who know 
would forget. Those who didn’t 
know could newer learn. Back to 
the simplicity of the wheel and 
lever. That would make your kind 
of war impossible.” 

Enoch sat stiff and straight, un- 
able to speak. 

“I told you it was drastic,” 
Ulysses said. 

“I couldn’t!” Enoch said. “No 
one could.” 

“Perhaps you can’t. But con- 
sider this : If there is a war . .” 

“I know. If there is a war, it 
could be worse. But it wouldn’t 
stop war. It’s not the kind of thing 
I had in mind. People still could 
fight, still could kill.” 

“With clubs,” said Ulysses. 
“Maybe bows and arrows. Rifles, 
so long as they still had rifles, and 
until they ran out of ammunition. 
Then they wouldn’t know how to 
make more powder or how to get 
the metal to make the bullets or 
even how to make the bullets. 
There might be fighting, but 
there’d be no holocaust. Cities 
would not be wiped out by nu- 
clear warheads, for no one could 
fire a rocket or arm the warhead 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



143 



— perhaps wouldn’t even know 
what a rocket or a warhead was.” 

“It would be terrible,” Enoch 
said. 

“So is war,” Ulysses said. 

“But how long?” asked Enoch. 
“How long would it last? We 
wouldn’t have to go back to stu- 
pidity forever?” 

“Several generations,” said 
Ulysses. “By that time the effect 
would gradually begin wearing 
off. The people slowly would 
shake off their moronic state and 
and begin their intellectual climb 
again. They’d be given a second 
chance.” 

“They could,” said Enoch, “m 
a few generations after that ar- 
rive at pxactly the same situation 
that we have today.” 

“Possibly.” 

“It’s too much for one man . 

“Something hopeful,” Ulysses 
said, “that you might consider. 
The method is offered only to 
those races which seem to us to 
be worth the saving.” 

“You have to give me time,” 
said Enoch. 

But he knew there was no time. 

XIX 

A LONG time later he roused 
himself, shook his head and 
reached for the rifle on the peg. 

He needed something to take 
his mind off what Ulysses had 
said. And he needed the targ^ 



practice. It had been too long 
since he’d been on the rifle range. 
He spoke the word, and watched 
the wall slide back, and clumped 
down the stairs to the basement. 

The basement was huge. It 
stretched out into a dim haze 
beyond the lights which he had 
turned on, a place of tunnels and 
rooms, carved deep into the rock 
that folded up to underlie the 
ridge. 

Here were the massive tanks 
filled with the various solutions 
for the tank travelers; here the 
pumps and the generators, which 
operated on a principle alien to 
the human manner of generating 
electric power, and far beneath 
the floor of the basement itself 
those great storage tanks which 
held the acids and the soupy mat- 
ter which once had been the crea- 
tures which came traveling to the 
station, leaving behind them, as 
they went on to some other place, 
the useless bodies which then 
must be disposed of. 

Enoch moved across the floor, 
past the tanks and generators, 
imtil he came to a gallery that 
stretched out into the darkness. 
He found the panel and pressed 
it to bring on the lights, then 
walked down the gallery. On ei- 
ther side were metal shelves 
which had been installed to ac- 
commodate the overflow of gadg- 
ets, of artifacts, of all sorts of gifts 
which had been brought him by 



the travelers. From floor to ceiling 
the shelves were jammed with a 
junkyard accumulation from all 
the corners of the galaxy. And 
yet, thought Enoch, perhaps not 
actually a junkyard, for very little 
of this stuff was actual junk. All 
of it was serviceable and had 
some purpose, either practical or 
aesthetic, if only that purpose 
could be learned. Although per- 
haps not in every instance a pur- 
pose that would be applicable to 
humans. 

Down at the end of the shelves 
was one section of shelving into 
which the articles were packed 
more systematically and with 
greater care, each one tagged and 
numbered, with cross-filing to a 
card catalogue and certain jour- 
nal dates. These were the articles 
of which he knew the purpose 
and, in certain instances, some- 
thing of the principles involved. 
There were some that were inno- 
cent enough and others that held 
great potential value and still 
others that had, at the moment, 
no connection whatsoever with the 
human way of life — and there 
were a few, tagged in red, that 
made one shudder to even think 
upon. 

He went down the gallery, his 
footsteps echoing loudly as he 
trod through this place of alien 
ghosts. 

Finally the gallery widened 
into an oval room. Here the walls 



144 



GALAXY 



iHERE GATHER THE STARS 

i 



were padded with a thick gray 
substance that would entrap a 
bullet and prevent a ricochet. 

Enoch walked over to a panel 
set inside a deep recess, sunk into 
the wall. He reached in and 
thumbed up a tumbler, then step- 
ped quickly out into the center 
of the room. 

Slowly the room began to dark- 
en. Then suddenly it seemed to 
flare — and he was in the room 
no longer, but in another place, 
a place he had never seen before. 

TTE STOOD on a little hillock. 

In front of him the land 
sloped down to a sluggish river 
bordered by marsh. Between the 
.beginning of the marsh and the 
foot of the hillock stretched a sea 
of rough, tall grass. There was no 
wind, but the grass was rippling. 
He knew that the rippling mo- 
tion was caused by many moving 
bodies, foraging in the grass. Out 
of it came a savage grunting, as 
if a thousand angry hogs were 
fighting for choice swill. And from 
somewhere farther off, perhaps 
from the river, came a deep, mo- 
notonous bellowing that sounded 
hoarse and tired. 

Enoch felt the hair crawling on 
his scalp "and he thrust the rifle 
out and ready. It was puzzling. 
He felt and knew the danger, 
though as yet there was no danger. 
Still, the very air of this place — 
wherever it might be — seemed 

145 



to crawl with danger like a dank, 
miasmic fog. 

He spun around. Close behind 
him the thick, dark woods 
climbed down the range of river 
hills, stopping at the sea of grass 
which flowed around the hillock 
on which he found himself. Off 
beyond the hills loomed a range 
of mighty mountains that seemed 
to fade into the sky, purple to 
their peaks, with no sign of snow 
upon them. 

Two things came trotting from 
the woods and stopped at the 
edge of it. They sat down and 
grinned at him, with their tails 
wrapped neatly round their feet. 
They might have been wolves or 
dogs, but they were neither one. 
They were nothing he had ever 
seen or heard of. Their pelts glis- 
tened in the weak sunshine, as if 
they had been greased, but the 
pelts stopped at their necks, with 
their skulls and faces bare. Like 
evil old men, off on a masquerade, 
with their bodies draped in the 
hides of wolves. But the disguise 
was spoiled by the lolling tongues 
which spilled out of their mouths, 
glistening scarlet against the bone- 
white of their faces. 

The wood was still. There were 
only the two gaunt beasts sitting 
on their haunches. They sat and 
grinned at him, a strangely tooth- 
less grin. 

The wood was dark and tan- 
gled, the foliage so dark green 



that it was almost black. All the 
leaves shone as if they had been 
polished. 

Enoch spun around again, to 
look back toward the river. 
Crouched at the edge of the grass 
was a line of toad-like monstrosi- 
ties, six feet long and standing 
three feet high, their bodies the 
color of a dead fish belly, and 
each with a single eye, or what 
seemed to be an eye, which cov- 
ered a great part of the area just 
above the snout. The eyes were 
faceted and glowed in the dim 
sunlight, as the eyes of a hunting 
cat will glow when caught in a 
beam of light. 

The hoarse bellowing still came 
from the river and in between 
the bellowing there was a faint, 
thin buzzing, angry and malicious, 
as if a giant mosquito might be 
hovering for attack. 

Enoch jerked up his head to 
look into the sky and far in the 
depths of it he saw a string of 
dots, so high that there was no 
way of knowing what kind of 
things they were. From the corner 
of his eye he caught the sense of 
flowing motion and swung back 
toward the woods. 

rpHE WOLF-LIKE bodies with 

the skull-like heads were com- 
ing up the hill in a silent rush. 

They did not seem to run. 
There was no motion of their run- 
ning. Rather they were moving 



146 



GALAXY 



as if they had been squirted from 
a tube. 

Enoch jerked up his rifle and it 
came into his shoulder, fitting as 
if it were a part of him. The bead 
settled in the rear-sight notch and 
blotted out the skull-like face of 
the leading beast. The gun bucked 
as he squeezed the trigger and, 
without waiting to see if the shot 
had downed the beast, the rifle 
barrel was swinging toward the 
second as his right fist worked 
the bolt. The rifle bucked again 
and the second wolf-like being 
somersaulted and slid forward for 
an instant, then began rolling 
down the hill, flopping limply as 
it rolled. 

Enoch worked the bolt again 
and the spent brass case glittered 
in the sun as he turned swiftly 
to face the other slope. 

The toad-like things were 
closer now. They had been creep- 
ing in, but as he turned they stop- 
ped and squatted, staring mind- 
lessly at him. 

He reached a hand into his 
pocket and took out two car- 
tridges, cramming them into the 
magazine to replace the shells 
he’d fired. 

The bellowing down by the 
river had stopped, but now there 
was a honking sound that he could 
not place. Turning cautiously, he 
tried to locate what might be 
making it, but there was nothing 
to be seen. The honking sound 



seemed to be coming from the 
forest, but there was nothing 
moving. 

In between the honking, he still 
could hear the buzzing and it 
seemed louder now. He glanced 
into the sky and the dots were 
larger and no longer in a line. 
They had formed into a circle 
and seemed to be spiraling down- 
ward, but they were still so high 
that he could not make out what 
kinds of things they were. 

He glanced back toward the 
toad-like monsters and they were 
closer than they had been before. 
They had crept up again. 

Enoch lifted the rifle and, be- 
fore it reached his shoulder, 
pressed the trigger, shooting from 
the hip. The eye of one of the 
foremost of them exploded, like 
the splash a stone would make if 
thrown into water. The creature 
did not jump or flop. It simply 
settled down, flat upon the 
ground, as if someone had put his 
foot upon it and had exerted 
exactly force enough to squash it 
flat. It lay there, flat, a big round 
hole where the eye had been. The 
hole was filling with a thick and 
ropy yellow fluid that might have 
been the creature’s blood. 

The others backed watchfully 
away, all the way off the hillock, 
and only stopped when they 
reached the grass edge. 

The honking was closer and 
the buzzing louder. There could 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



147 



be no doubt that the honking was 
coming from the hills. 

Tj^NOCH SWUNG about and 
saw it, striding through the 
sky, coming down the ridge, step- 
ping through the trees and honk- 
ing dolefully. It was a round and 
black balloon that swelled and de- 
flated with its honking. It jerked 
and swayed as it walked along, 
hung from the center of four 
stiff and spindly legs that arched 
above it to the joint that con- 
nected this upper portion of the 
leg arrangement with the down- 
ward-spraddling legs that raised it 
high above the forest. It was walk- 
ing jerkily, lifting its legs high 
to clear the massive treetops be- 
fore putting them down again. 
Each time it put down a foot, 
Enoch could hear the crunching 
of the branches and the crashing 
of the trees that it broke or 
brushed aside. 

Enoch felt the skin along his 
spine trying to roll up his back 
like a window shade, and the 
bristling of the hair along the base 
of his skull, obeying some pri- 
mordial instinct in its striving to 
raise itself erect into a fighting 
ruff. 

But even as he stood there, 
almost stiff with fright, some part 
of his brain remembered that one 
shot he had fired. His fingers dug 
into his pocket for another car- 
tridge to fill the magazine. 



The buzzing was much louder 
and the pitch had changed; now 
it was approaching at tremendous 
speed. 

Enoch jerked up his head. The 
dots no longer were circling in the 
sky, but were plunging down 
toward him, one behind the other. 

He flicked a glance toward the 
balloon, honking and jerking on 
its stilt-like legs. It still was com- 
ing on, but the plunging dots were 
faster and would reach the hillock 
first. 

He shifted the rifle forward, 
outstretched and ready to slap 
against his shoulder, and watched 
the falling creatures. They were 
dots no longer, but hideous 
streamlined bodies, each carrying 
a rapier that projected from its 
head. A bill of sorts, thought 
Enoch, for these things might be 
birds; but longer, thinner, larger, 
more deadly than any Earthly 
bird. 

The buzzing changed into a 
scream and the scream kept 
mounting up the scale until it set 
the teeth on edge. Through it, 
like a metronome measuring a 
beat, came the hooting of the 
black balloon that strode across 
the hills. 

Without knowing that he had 
moved his arms, Enoch had the 
rifle at his shoulder, waiting for 
that instant when the first of the 
plunging monsters was close 
enough to fire. 



148 



GALAXY 



They dropp>ed like stones out 
of the sky. They were bigger than 
he had thought they were — big 
and coming like arrows aimed 
directly at him. 

The rifle thudded against his 
shoulder. The first one crumpled, 
lost its arrow shape, folding up 
and falling, no longer on its 
course. He worked the bolt and 
fired again; and the second one 
in line lost its balance and began 
to tumble — and the bolt was 
worked once more and the trigger 
pressed. The third skidded in the 
air and went off at a slant, limp 
and ragged, fluttering in the wind, 
falling toward the river. 

The rest broke off their dive. 
They made a shallow turn and 
beat their way up into the sky, 
great wings like windmill vanes 
threshing desperately, 

A SHADOW fell across the 
hillock and a mighty pillar 
came down from somewhere over- 
head, driving down to strike to 
one side of the hillock. The 
ground trembled at the tread, and 
the water that lay hidden by the 
grass squirted high into the air. 

The honking blotted out all 
else and the great balloon was 
zooming down on him, cradled on 
the enormous legs. 

Enoch saw the face, if an3dhing 
so grotesque and so obscene could 
be called a face. There was a 
beak and beneath it a sucking 



mouth and a dozen or so other 
organs that might have been the 
eyes. 

' The legs were like inverted Vs, 
with the inner stroke somewhat 
shorter than the outer. And in the 
center of these inner joints hung 
the great balloon that was the 
body of the creature, with its face 
on the underside so that it could 
see all the hunting territory that 
might lie beneath it. 

But now auxiliary joints in the 
outer span of legs were bending 
to let the body of the creature 
down so it could seize its prey. 

Enoch was not conscious of 
putting up the rifle or of oper- 
ating it, but it was hammering 
at his shoulder. It seemed to him 
that a second part of him stood 
off, apart, and watched the firing 
of the rifle — as if the figure that 
held and fired the weapon might 
be a second man. 

Great gouts of flesh flew out of 
the black balloon. Jagged rents 
suddenly tore across it, and from 
these rents poured out a cloud of 
liquid that turned into a mist, 
with black droplets raining from 
it. 

The firing pin clicked on an 
empty breech and the gun was 
emprty, but there was no need of 
another shot. 

The great legs were folding, 
trembling as they folded. The 
shrunken body shivered convul- 
sively in the heavy mist that was 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



149 



pouring out of it. There was no 
hooting now. Enoch could hear 
the patter of the black drops fall- 
ing from that cloud, as they 
struck the short grass on the hill. 

There was a sickening odor. 
The drops where they fell on him 
were sticky, running like cold oil; 
and above him the great structure 
that had been the stilt-like crea- 
ture was toppling to the ground. 

Then the world faded swiftly 
and was no longer there. 

Enoch stood in the oval room 
in the faint glow of the bulbs. 
There was the heavy smell of 
powder and all about his feet, 
glinting in the light, lay the spent 
and shining cases that had been 
kicked out of the gun. 

He was back in the basement 
once again. The target shoot was 
over. 

E noch lowered the rifle 

and drew in a slow and care- 
ful breath. It always was like this, 
he thought. As if it were neces- 
sary for him to ease himself, by 
slow degrees, back to this world 
after the season of unreality. 

He knew that it would be illu- 
sion when he kicked on the switch 
that set into motion whatever was 
to happen, and he knew it had 
been illusion when it all had 
ended. But during the time that 
it was happening it was not illu- 
sion. It was as real and as sub- 
stantial as if it all were true. 



They had asked him, he re- 
membered, when the station had 
been built, if he had a hobby — 
if there was any sort of recrea- 
tional facility they could build 
into the station for him. And he 
had said that he would like a rifle 
range, expecting no more than a 
shooting gallery with ducks mov- 
ing on a chain or clay pipes ro- 
tating on a wheel. But that, of 
course, would have been too sim- 
ple for the screwball architects 
who had designed, and the slap- 
happy crew of tentacled work- 
men who had built, the galactic 
way station. 

At first they had not been cer- 
tain what he meant by a rifle 
range. He had to tell them how 
a rifle operated and for what it 
might be used. He had told them 
about hunting squirrels on sunny 
autumn mornings and shaking 
rabbits out of brushpiles with the 
first coming of the snow (al- 
though one did not use a rifle, but 
a shotgun, on the rabbits), about 
hunting coons of an autumn night, 
and waiting for the deer along 
the run that went down to the 
river. But he was dishonest. He 
did not tell them about that other 
use to which he’d put a rifle dur- 
ing four long years. 

He’d told them (since they 
were easy folks to talk with) 
about his youthful dream of some 
day going on a hunt in Africa, 
although even as he told them he 



150 



GALAXY 



well aware of how unattainable 
it was. 

But since that day he’d hunted 
(and been hunted by) beasts far 
stranger than anything that Afri- 
ca could boast. 

From what these beasts might 
have been patterned, if indeed 
they came from anywhere other 
than the imagination of those 
aliens who had set up the tapes 
which produced the target scene, 
he had no idea. There had so 
far, in the thousands of times that 
he had used the range, not been 
a duplication either in the scene 
nor in the beasts which rampaged 
about the scene. Although, per- 
haps, he thought, there might, 
somewhere, be an end of them, 
and then the whole sequence 
might start over and run its 
course once more. But it would 
make little difference now, for if 
the tapes should start rerunning 
there’d be but little chance of his 
recalling in any considerable de- 
tail those adventures he had lived 
so many years ago. 

tFE DID not understand the 
techniques or the principle 
which made possible this fantastic 
rifle range. Like many other 
things, he accepted it without the 
need of understanding. Although, 
some day, he thought, he might 
find the clue which in time would 
turn blind acceptance into under- 
standing not only of the range. 



but of many other equally won- 
derful things. 

He had often wondered what 
the aliens might think about his 
fascination with the rifle range, 
with that primal force that drove 
a man to kill, not for the joy of 
killing so much as to negate a 
danger, to meet force with a 
greater and more skillful force, 
cunning with more cunning. Had 
he, he wondered, given his alien 
friends concern in their assess- 
rnent of the human character by 
his preoccupation with the rifle? 
For the understanding of an alien, 
how could one draw a line be- 
tween the killing of other forms 
of life and the killing of one’s 
own? Was there actually a differ- 
ence that would stand up under 
logical examination between the 
sport of hunting and the sport of 
war? To an alien, perhaps, such 
3 tlifferentiation would be rather 
difficult, for in many cases the 
hunted animal would be more 
closely allied to the human hunter 
in its form and characteristics 
than would many of the aliens. 

Was war an instinctive thing, 
for which each ordinary man was 
as much responsible as the policy 
makers and the so-called states- 
men? It seemed impossible. Yet 
deep in every man was the com- 
bative instinct, the aggressive 
urge, the strange sense of compe- 
tition all of which spelled con- 
flict of one kind or another if 



here gather the stars 



151 



carried to its logical, inevitable 
conclusion. 

He put the rifle underneath his 
arm and walked over to the panel. 
Sticking from a slot in the bottom 
of it was a piece of tape. 

He pulled it out and puzzled 
out the symbols. They were not 
reassuring. He had not done so 
well. 

He had missed that first shot 
he had fired at the charging wor- 
thing with the old man’s face, and 
back there somewhere, in that 
dimension of unreality, it and its 
companion were snarling over the 
tangled, torn mass of ribboned 
flesh and broken bone that had 
been Enoch Wallace. 

XX 

TTE WENT back through the 
gallery, with its gifts stacked 
there as other gifts, in regular 
human establishments, might be 
stacked away in dry and dusty 
attics. It was, he thought, the 
packrat instinct that he had which 
had never let him bring himself 
to throw them away. Although, 
even if he could, it would have 
been impossible to throw any of 
this collection of stuff away. It 
would never do to put in the 
reach of other humans any single 
item which rested on the shelves. 

The tape nagged at him, the 
little piece of tape which said that 
while he had made all his other 



shots, he had missed that first 
one back there on the hillock. It 
was not often that he missed. And 
his training had been for that very 
type of shooting — the you-never- 
know-what-will-happen-next, the 
totally unexpected, the kill-or-be- 
killed kind of shooting that thou- 
sands of expeditions into the tar- 
get area had taught him. Perhaps 
he had not been as faithful in 
his practice lately as he should 
have been. 

Near the end of the gallery he 
saw the black bulk of a trunk 
projecting from beneath the low- 
er shelf, too big to fit comfortably 
beneath it, jammed against the 
wall, but with a foot or two of it 
still projecting out beyond the 
shelf. 

He went on walking past it, 
then suddenly turned around. 
That trunk, he thought. That was 
the trunk which had belonged to 
the Hazer who had died upstairs. 
It was his legacy from that being 
whose stolen body would be 
brought back to its grave this 
evening. 

He walked over to the shelving 
and leaned his rifle against the 
wall. Stooping, he pulled the 
trunk clear of its resting place. 

Once before, prior to carrying 
it down the stairs and storing it 
here beneath the shelves, he had 
gone through its contents, but at 
the time he’d not been too inter- 
ested. Now, suddenly, he felt an 



152 



GALAXY 



absorbing interest in what it 
might contain. 

He lifted the lid carefully and 
tilted it back against the shelves. 

Crouching above the open 
trunk, and without touching any- 
thing to start with, he tried to 
catalogue the upper layer of its 
contents. 

T here was a shimmering 
cloak, neatly folded. Perhaps 
it was some sort of ceremonial 
garment. Atop it lay a tiny bottle 
that was a blaze of reflected light, 
as if someone had taken d large 
diamond and hollowed it out to 
make a bottle of it. Beside the 
cloak lay a nest of balls, deep 
violet and dull, with no shine at 
all, looking for all the world like 
a bunch of table tennis balls that 
someone had cemented together 
to make a globe. But that was 
not the way it was, Enoch remem- 
bered; for that other time he had 
been entranced by them and had 
picked them up, to find that they 
were not cemented, but could be 
freely moved about, although 
never outside the context of their 
shape. One ball could not be bro- 
ken from the mass, no matter 
how hard one might try, but 
would move about, as if buoyed 
in a fluid, among all the other 
balls. One could move any, or all, 
of the balls, but the mass re- 
mained the same. 

A calculator of some sort. 



Enoch wondered? But that 
seemed only barely possible, for 
one ball was entirely like another; 
there was no way in which they 
could be identified. Or, at least, 
no way to identify them so far 
as concerned the human eye. Was 
it possible that identification 
might be possible to a Hazer’s 
eye? And if a calculator, what 
kind of a calculator? Mathema- 
tical? Or ethical? Or philosophi- 
cal? Perhaps a sort of game — a 
game of solitaire? 

Given time a man might finally 
get it figured out. But there was 
no time and no incentive at the 
moment to spend upon one par- 
ticular item any great amount of 
time when theire were hundreds 
of other items equally fantastic 
and incomprehensible. For while 
one puzzled over a single item, the 
edges of his mind would always 
wonder if he might not be spend- 
ing time on the most insignificant 
of the entire lot. 

He was a victim of museum 
fatigue, Enoch told himself, over- 
whelmed by the many pieces of 
the unknown scattered all about 
him. 

He reached out a hand, not for 
the globe of balls, but for the 
shining bottle that lay atop the 
cloak. As he picked it up and 
brought it closer, he saw that 
there was a line of writing en- 
graved upon the glass (or dia- 
mond?) of the bottle. Slowly he 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



153 



studied out the meaning of the 
writing. 

^^HERE HAD been a time, 

long ago, when he had been 
able to read the Hazer language, 
if not fluently, at least well 
enough to get along. But he had 
not read it for some years now 
and he had lost a good deal of 
it and he stumbled haltingly from 
one symbol to another. Trans- 
lated very freely, the inscription 
on the bottle read: To be taken 
when the first symptoms occur. 

A bottle of medicine! To be 
taken when the first symptoms 
occur. The symptoms, perhaps, 
that had come so quickly and 
built up so rapidly that the owner 
of this bottle could make no move 
to reach it and so had died, falling 
from the sofa. 

Almost reverently, he put the 
bottle back in its place atop the 
cloak, fitting it back into the faint 
impression it had made from 
lying there. 

So different from us in so many 
ways, thought Enoch, and then 
in other little ways so like us that 
it is frightening. For that bottle 
and the inscription on its face 
was an exact parallel of the pre- 
scription bottle from any corner 
drugstore. 

Beside the globe of balls was 
a box, wood, with a simple clasp 
to hold it shut.; He flipped back 
the lid and inside he saw the me- 



tallic sheen of the material the 
Hazers used as paper. 

Carefully he lifted out the first 
sheet, and saw that it was a long 
strip of the material folded in 
accordion fashion. Underneath it 
were more strips, apparently, of 
the same material. 

There was writing on it, faint 
and faded, and Enoch held it 
close to read it. 

To my — , — friend: (although 
it was not friend. Blood brother, 
perhaps, or colleague. And the 
adjectives which preceded it were 
such as to escape his sense en- 
tirely.) 

The writing was hard to read. 
It bore some resemblance to the 
formalized version of the lan- 
guage, but apparently bore the 
imprint of the writer’s personality, 
expressed in curlicues and flour- 
ishes which obscured the form. 
Enoch worked his way slowly 
down the paper, missing much of 
what was there, but picking up 
the sense of much that had been 
written. 

The writer had been on a visit 
to some other planet. While there 
he had performed some sort of 
function (although exactly what 
was not entirely clear) which had 
to do with his approaching death. 

P^NOCH, STARTLED, went 
back over the phrase again. 
And while much of the rest of 
what was written was not clear, 



154 



GALAXY 



that part of it was. My approach- 
ing death, he had written, and 
there was no room for mistransla- 
tion. The words were clear. 

He urged that his good 
(friend?) do likewise. He said it 
was a comfort and made clear 
the road. 

There was no further explana- 
tion'' no further reference. Just 
the calm declaration that he had 
done something which he felt 
must be arranged about his death. 
As if he knew that death was 
near and was not only unafraid, 
but almost unconcerned. 

The next passage (for there 
were no paragraphs) told about 
someone he had met and how 
they’d talked about a certain mat- 
ter which made no sense at all to 
Enoch, lost in a terminology he 
did not recognize. 

And then : I am most con- 
cerned about the mediocrity (in- 
competence? inability? weak- 
ness?) of the recent custodian of 
(and then that cryptic symbol 
which could be translated, rough- 
ly, as the Talisman.) For (a word, 
which from context, seemed to 
mean a great length of time), 
ever since the death of the last 
custodian, the Talisman has been 
but poorly served. It has been, 
in all reality, (another long time 
term), since a true (sensitive?) 

I has been found to carry out' its 
purpose. Many have been tested 
■ and none has qualified, and for 



the lack of such a one the galaxy 
has lost its close identification 
with the ruling principle of life. 
We here at the (temple? sanctu- 
ary?) all are greatly concerned 
that without a proper linkage be- 
tween the people and (several 
words that were not decipherable ) 
the galaxy will go down in chaos 
(and another line that he could 
not puzzle out.) 

The next sentence introduced 
a new subject — the plans that 
were going forward for some cul- 
tural festival which concerned 
a concept that, to Enoch, was hazy 
at the best. 

Enoch slowly folded up the let- 
ter and put it back into the box. 
He felt a faint uneasiness in read- 
ing what he had, as if he’d pried 
into a friendship that he had no 
right to know. We here at the 
temple, the letter had said. Per- 
haps the writer had been one of 
the Hazer mystics, writing to his 
old friend, the philosopher. And 
the other letters, quite possibly, 
were from that same mystic — 
letters that the dead old Hazer 
had valued so highly that he took 
them along with him when he 
went traveling. 

A slight breeze seemed to be 
blowing across Enoch’s shoulders; 
not actually a breeze, but a 
strange motion and a coldness to 
the air. 

He glanced back into the gal- 
lery and there was nothing stir- 




HERE GATHER THE STARS 



155 



ring to account for it, nothing to 
be seen. 

The wind had quit its blowing, 
if it had ever blown. Here one 
moment, gone the next. Like a 
passing ghost, thought Enoch. 

Did the Hazer have a ghost? 

T he people back on Vega 

XXI had known the moment 
he had died and all the circum- 
stances of his death. They had 
known again about the body dis- 
appearing. And the letter had 
spoken calmly, much more calmly 
than would have been in the ca- 
pacity of most humans, about the 
writer’s near approach to death. 

Was it possible that the Hazers 
knew more of life and death than 
most? Had it been spelled out in 
black and white in some deposi- 
tory in the galaxy? 

Was the answer there? he won- 
dered. 

Squatting there, he thought 
that perhaps it might be, that 
someone already knew what life 
was for and what its destiny. 
There was a comfort in the 
thought, a strange sort of personal 
comfort in being able to believe 
that some intelligence might have 
solved the riddle of that mysteri- 
ous equation of the universe. 

Ulysses, he thought, had not 
told him all the truth about the 
Talisman. He had told him that 
it had disappeared and that the 
galaxy was without it, but he had 



not told him that for many years 
its power and glory had been 
dimmed by the failure of its cus- 
todian to provide a proper link- 
age between the people and the 
force. And all that time the cor- 
rosion occasioned by that failure 
had eaten away at the bonds of 
the galactic confraternity. What- 
ever might be happening no\^had 
not happened in the last few 
years; it had been building up for 
a longer time than most aliens 
would admit. Although, come to 
thing of it, most aliens probably 
did not know. 

Enoch closed the box lid and 
put it back into the trunk. Some 
day, he thought, when he was in 
the proper frame of mind, when 
the pressure of events- made him 
less emotional, when he could dull 
the guilt of prying, he would 
achieve a scholarly and conscien- 
tious translation of those letters. 
For in them, he felt certain, he 
might find further understanding 
of that intriguing race. He might, 
he thought, then be better able 
to gauge their humanity — not 
humanity in the sense of being 
a member of the human race of 
Earth, but in the sense that cer- 
tain rules of conduct must under- 
lie all racial concepts even as the 
thing called humanity in its nar- 
row sense underlay the human 
concept. 

He reached up to close the lid 
of the trunk and then he hesitated. 



^OME DAY, he had said. And 
^ there might not be a some 
day. It was a state of mind to be 
always thinking some day, a state 
of mind made possible by the 
conditions inside this station. For 
1 here there were endless days to 
I come, forever and forever there 
were days to come. A man’s con- 
cept of time was twisted out of 
shape and reason and he could 
look ahead complacently down a 
I long, almost never-ending, avenue 
] of time. But that might be all 
I over now. Time might suddenly 
snap back into its rightful focus. 
Should he leave this station, the 
long procession of days to come 
would end. 

He pushed back the lid again 
until it rested against the shelves. 
Reaching in, he lifted out the box 
. and set it on the floor beside him. 
He’d take it upstairs, he told him- 
self, and put it with the other 
stuff that he must be prepared 
immediately to take along with 
him if he should leave the station. 

If? he asked himself. Was there 
a question any longer? Had he, 
somehow, made that hard deci- 
sion? Had it crept upon him una- 
ware, so that he now was com- 
mitted to it? 

And if he had actually arrived 
at that decision, then he must, 
also, have arrived at the other 
one. If he left the station, then he 
could no longer be in a position 
to appear before Galactic Central 

|hERE GATHER THE STARS 



to plead that Earth be cured of 
war. 

You are the representative of 
the Earth, Ulysses had told him. 
You are the only one who can 
represent the Earth. 

But could he, in reality, repre- 
sent the Earth? Was he any 
longer a true representative of the 
human race? He was a nineteenth 
century man; how could he repre- 
sent the twentieth? How much, 
he wondered, does the human 
character change with each gen- 
eration? And not only was he of 
the nineteenth century, but he 
had, as well, lived for almost a 
hundred years under a separate 
and a special circumstance, un- 
like any other human. 

He knelt there, regarding him-- 
self with awe, and a little pky too, 
wondering what he was. Some 
strange sort of hybrid? A galactic 
halfbreed? 

Slowly he pulled the lid down 
and pushed it tight. Then he 
shoved the trunk back under- 
neath the shelves. 

He tucked the box of letters 
underneath his arm and rose, 
picking up his rifle, and headed 
for the stairs.

XTE FOUND some empty car- 
tons stacked in the kitchen 
corner, boxes that Winslowe had 
used to bring out from town the 



156 



GALAXY 



157 



supplies that he had ordered, and 
began to pack. 

The journals, stacked neatly 
in order, filled one large box and 
a part of another. He took a stack 
of old newspapers and carefully 
wrapped the twelve diamond bot- 
tles off the mantle and packed 
them in another box, thickly pad- 
ded, to guard against their break- 
age. Out of the cabinet he got the 
Vegan music box and wrapped it 
as carefully. He pulled out of 
another cabinet the alien litera- 
ture that he had and piled it in 
the fourth box. He went through 
his desk, but there wasn’t too 
much there, only odds and ends 
tucked here and there throughout 
the drawers. He found his chart 
and, crumpling it, threw it in the 
wastebasket that stood beside his 
desk. 

The already filled boxes he car- 
ried across the room and stacked 
beside the door for easy reaching. 
When Lewis came with the body 
he would have a truck. If he had 
the important stuff all packed he 
could have it waiting. 

The important stuff, he thought. 
Who could judge importance? It 
was all important; every item 
should be taken. And that might 
be possible. Given time and with 
no extra complications, it might 
be possible to haul it all away, 
all that was in this room and 
stored down in the basement. It 
all was his. He had a right to it, 

158 



for it had been given him. But 
that did not mean that Galactic 
Central might not object most 
strenuously to his taking any of 
it. 

And if that should happen, it 
was vital that he should be able to 
get away with those most im- 
portant items. 

He stood undecided, looking all 
about the room. There were all 
the items on the coffee table and 
those should be taken, too, in- 
cluding the little flashing pyramid 
of globes that Lucy had set to 
working. 

He saw that the Pet once again 
had crawled off the table and 
fallen on the floor. He stooped 
and picked it up and held it in 
his hands. It had grown an extra 
knob or two since the last time he 
had looked at it. It was now a 
faint and delicate pink, whereas 
the last time he had noticed it had 
been a cobalt blue. 

TTE PROBABLY was wrong, he 
told himself, in calling it the 
Pet. It might not be alive. If it 
were, it was a sort of life he could 
not even guess at. It was not me- 
tallic and it was not stone, but 
very close to both. A file made no 
impression on it and he’d been 
tempted a time or two to whack 
it with a hammer to see what that 
might do, although he was willing 
to bet it would have no effect at 
all. It grew slowly, and it moved, 

GALAXY 



L 



but there was no way of knowing 
how it moved. But leave it and 
come back and it would have 
moved — a little. It knew when 
it was being watched and it would 
not move while watched. It did 
not eat so far as he could see and 
it seemed to have no wastes. It 
changed colors, but entirely with- 
out season and with no visible 
reason for the change. 

A being from somewhere in the 
I direction of Sagittarius had given 
it to him just a year or two ago. 
The creature had been something 
for the books. He probably wasn’t 
actually a walking plant, but that 
was what he’d looked like — a 
rather spindly plant that had 
been shorted on good water and 
cheated on good soil, but which 
had sprouted a crop of dime store 
bangles that rang like a thousand 
silver bells when he made any 
sort of motion. 

Enoch remembered that he had 
tried to ask the being what the 
gift might be, but the walking 
plant had simply clashed its ban- 
gles and filled the place with ring- 
ing sound and didn’t try to an- 
swer. 

So he had put the gift on one 
end of the desk and hours later, 
after the being was long gone, he 
found that it had moved to the 
other end of the desk. But it had 
seemed too crazy to think that a 
thing like that could move, so he 
finally convinced himself that he 



was mistaken as to where he’d 
put it. It was not until days later 
that he was able to convince him- 
self it moved. 

He’d have to take it when he 
left and Lucy’s pyramid and the 
cube that showed you pictures of 
other worlds when you looked in- 
side of it and a great deal of 
other stuff. 

He stood with the Pet held in 
his hand and now, for the first 
time, he wondered at why he 
might be packing. 

¥TE WAS acting as if he’d de- 
cided he would leave the 
station, as if he’d chosen Earth 
as against the galaxy. But when 
and how, he wondered, had he de- 
cided it? Decision should be 
based on weighing and on measur- 
ing and he had weighed and meas- 
ured nothing. He had not posed 
the advantages and the disadvan- 
tages and tried to strike a balance. 
He had not thought it out. Some- 
how, somewhere, it had sneaked 
up on him — this decision which 
had seemed impossible, but now 
had been reached so easily. 

Was it, he wondered, that he 
had absorbed, unconsciously, such 
an odd mixture of alien thought 
and ethics that he had evolved, 
unknown to himself, a new way 
in which to think? Perhaps some 
subconscious way of thought that 
had lain inoperative until now, 
when it had been needed. 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



159 



There was a box or two out in 
the shed. He’d go and get them 
and finish up the packing of what 
he’d pick out here. Then he’d go 
down into the basement and start 
lugging up the stuff that he had 
tagged. He glanced toward the 
window and realized, with some 
surprise, that he would have to 
hurry, for the sun was close to 
setting. It would be evening soon. 

He remembered that he’d for- 
gotten lunch, but he had no time 
to eat. He could get something 
later. 

He turned to put the Pet back 
on the table and as he did a faint 
sound caught his ear and froze 
him where he stood. 

It was the slight chuckle of a 
materializer operating. He could 
not mistake it. He had heard the 
sound too often to be wrong 
about it now. 

And it must be, he knew, the 
official materializer, for no one 
could have traveled on the other 
without the sending of a message. 

Ulysses, he thought. Ulysses 
coming back again. Or, perhaps 
some other member of Galactic 
Central. For if Ulysses had been 
coming, he would have sent a 
message. 

He took a quick step forward 
so he could see the corner where 
the materializer stood and a dark 
and slender figure was stepping 
out from the target circle. 

“Ulysses!” Enoch cried, but 



even as spoke he realized it was 
not Ulysses. 

For an instant he had the im- 
pression of a top hat, of white tie 
and tails, of a jauntiness, and 
then he saw that the creature was 
a rat that walked erect, with sleek, 
dark fur covering its body and a 
sharp, axe-like rodent face. For 
an instant, as it turned its head 
toward him, he caught the red 
glitter of its eyes. Then it turned 
back toward the corner and he 
saw that its hand was lifted, was 
pulling out of a harnessed holster 
hung about its middle something 
that glinted with a metallic shim- 
mer even in the shadow. 

^^HERE WAS something very 

wrong about it. The creature 
should have greeted him. It 
should have said hello and come 
out to meet him. But instead it 
had thrown him that one red-eyed 
glance and then turned back to 
the corner. 

The metallic object came out 
of the holster. It could only be a 
weapon. 

And was this the way, thought 
Enoch, that they would close the 
station? One quick shot, without 
a word, and the station keeper 
dead upon the floor. With some- 
one other than Ulysses, because 
Ulysses could not be trusted to 
kill a long-time friend, even for 
the galactic confraternity. 

The rifle was lying across the 



160 



GALAXY 



desk top and there wasn’t any 
time. 

But the rat-like creature was 
not turning toward the room. It 
still was facing toward the corner 
and its hand was coming up, with 
the weapon glinting in it. 

An alarm twanged within 
Enoch’s brain. He swung his arm 
and yelled, hurling the Pet toward 
the creature in the corner, the 
yell jerked out of him, involun- 
tarily, from the bottom of his 
lungs. 

For the creature, he realized, 
had not been intent on the killing 
of the keeper, but the disruption 
of the station. The only thing 
there was to aim at in the corner 
was the control complex, the 
nerve center of the station’s oper- 
ation. If that should be knocked 
out, the station would be dead. 
To set it in operation once again 
it would be necessary to send a 
crew of technicians out in a space- 
ship from the nearest station — a 
trip that would require many 
years to make. 

At Enoch’s yell, the creature 
jerked around, dropping toward 
a crouch. The flying Pet, tumbling 
end for end, caught it in the 
belly and drove it back against 
the wall. 

Enoch charged, arms outspread 
to grapple with the creature. The 
gun flew from the creature’s hand 
and pinwheeled across the floor. 
Then Enoch was upon the alien 



and even as he closed with it, 
his nostrils were assailed by its 
body stench — a sickening wave 
of nastiness. 

He wrapped his arms about it 
and heaved. It was not heavy. He 
jerked it from the corner and 
swung it around and sent it skid- 
ding out across the floor. 

It crashed against a chair and 
came to a stop and then like a 
steel coil it rose off the floor and 
pounced for the gun. 

Enoch took two great strides 
and had it by the neck, lifting it 
and shaking it so savagely that 
the recovered gun flew from its 
hand again. The bag it carried 
on a thong across its shoulder 
pounded like a vibrating trip- 
hammer against its hairy ribs. 

The stench was so thick that 
one could almost see it; Enoch 
gagged on it as he shook the crea- 
ture. And suddenly it was worse, 
much worse, like a fire raging in 
one’s throat and a hammer in 
one’s head. It was like a physical 
blow that hit one in the belly 
and shoved against the chest. 
Enoch let go his hold upon the 
creature and staggered back, dou- 
bled up and retching. He lifted 
his hands to his face and tried to 
push the stench away, to clear 
his nostrils and his mouth, to rub 
it from his eyes. 

Through a haze he saw the 
creature rise and, snatching up 
the gun, rush toward the door. He 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



161 



did not hear the phrase that the 
creature spoke, but the door came 
open and the creature spurted 
forward and was gone. And the 
door slammed shut again. 

XXII 



Ip'NOCH WOBBLED across the 
room to the desk and caught 
at it for support. The stench was 
diminishing and his head was 
clearing. He scarcely could be- 
lieve that it all had happened. 

It was incredible. The creature 
had traveled on the official ma- 
terializer, and no one but a mem- 
ber of Galactic Central could tra- 
vel by that route. And no member 
of Galactic Central, he was con- 
vinced, would have acted as the 
rat-like creature had. Likewise, 
the creature had known the 
phrase that would operate the 
door. No one but himself and 
Galactic Central would have 
known that phrase. 

He reached out and picked up 
his rifle and hefted it in his fist. 

It was all right, he thought. 
There was nothing harmed. Ex- 
cept that there was an alien loose 
upon the Earth and that was 
something that could not be al- 
lowed. The Earth was barred to 
aliens. As a planet which had not 
been recognized by the galactic 
confraternity, it was off limits. 

He stood with the rifle in his 
hand and knew what he must do. 



He must get that alien back. He 
■ must get it off the Earth. 

He strode toward the door and 
out around the corner of the 
house. 

The alien was running across 
the field. It had almost reached 
the line of woods. 

Enoch ran desperately, but be- 
fore he was halfway down the 
field, the rat-like quarry had 
plunged into the woods and dis- 
appeared. 

The woods were beginning to 
darken. The slanting rays of light 
from the setting sun still lighted 
the upper canopy of the foliage, 
but on the forest floor the sha- 
dows had begun to gather. 

As he ran into the, fringe of the 
woods, Enoch caught a glimpse 
of the creature angling down a 
small ravine and plunging up the 
other slope, racing through a 
heavy cover of ferns that reached 
almost to its middle. 

If it kept on in that direction, 
Enoch told himself, it might work 
out all right. The slope beyond 
the ravine ended in a clump of 
rocks under a cliff. It might be a 
little rough to dig the alien from 
the rocks if it took refuge there, 
but it could not get away. Al- 
though he could waste no time. 
The sun was setting; it would 
soon be dark. 

Running hard, Enoch crossed 
the area covered by the ferns and 
came out on the sharper slope 



some hundred yards below the 
boulders. Here the cover was not 
^ so dense, spotty underbrush and 
I a scattering of trees. The soft 
loam of the forest floor gave way 
, to a footing of shattered rock 
j which through the years had been 
' chipped off the boulders by the 
, winter’s frost, rolling down the 
slope. They lay there now, cov- 
' ered with thick moss, a treacher- 
I ous place to walk. 

f 

I f I ■'HERE WAS no sign of the 
alien. Then, out of the corner 
of his vision, he saw motion and 
t threw himself forward to the 
ground. Behind a patch of hazel 
brush he saw the alien outlined 
against the sky, its head pivoting 
back and forth to sweep the slop)e 
below, the weapon half lifted and 
set for instant use. 

Enoch lay frozen, with his out- 
stretched hand gripping the rifle. 
There was a slash of pain across 
• one set of knuckles and he knew 
, that he had skinned them on the 
■ rock as he had dived for cover. 
I The alien dropped from sight 

I behind the boulders and Enoch 
slowly pulled the rifle back to 
where he would be able to handle 
it should a shot present itself. 

Although, he wondered, would 
he dare to fire? Would he dare to 
kill an alien? 

II The alien could have killed 
B him back there at the station, 
H when he had been knocked silly 



by the dreadful stench. But it had 
not killed him; it had fled instead. 
Was the creature so badly fright- 
ened that all that it could think 
of had been to get away? Or had 
it been as reluctant to kill a sta- 
tion keeper as he was to kill an 
alien? 

He searched the rocks above 
him. There was no motion and 
not a thing to see. He must move 
up that slope, and quick. Time 
would work to the advantage of 
the alien. Darkness could not be 
more than thirty minutes off and 
before dark had fallen this issue 
must be settled. If the alien got 
away, there’d be little chance to 
find it. 

An alien could not be allowed 
upon the Earth. He shuddered 
as he imagined some of the com- 
plications which could arise from 
such a situation. 

And why, asked a second self, 
standing to one side, should you 
worry about alien complications? 
For are you not prepared, your- 
self, to hand Earth as much alien 
lore and learning as may be with- 
in your F>ower? 

A rustle in the bushes to his 
left brought him around with the 
rifle up and ready. 

And there was Lucy Fisher, not 
more than twenty feet away. 

ii^ET OUT of here!” he 
shouted, forgetting that 
she could not hear him. 



162 



GALAXY

163 



But she did not seem to notice. 
She motioned to the left and 
made a sweeping motion with 
her hand, toward the boulders. 

Go away, he said underneath 
his breath, and motioned her to 
go back. 

She shook her head and sprang 
away, in a running crouch, 
moving further to the left and 
up the slope. 

Enoch scrambled to his feet 
after her. And as he did the air 
behind him made a frying sound, 
and there was the sharp bite of 
ozone in the air. 

He hit the ground instinctively. 
Farther down the slope a square 
yard of ground boiled and 
steamed. 

A laser, Enoch thought. The al- 
ien’s weapon was a laser, packing 
a terrific punch in a narrow beam 
of light. 

He gathered himself together 
and made a short rush up the hill- 
side, throwing himself prone be- 
hind a twisted birch clump. 

The air made the frying sound 
again and there was an instant’s 
blast of heat. Over on the reverse 
slope a patch of ground was 
steaming. Ash floated down and 
settled on Enoch’s arms. He 
flashed a quick glance upward 
and saw that the top half of the 
birch clump was gone, sheared 
off by the laser and reduced to 
ash. Tiny coils of smoke rose 
lazily from the severed stumps. 



No matter what it might have 
done or failed to do at the station, 
the alien now meant business. It 
knew that it was cornered. 

Enoch huddled against the 
ground, worried about Lucy. He 
hoped she was safe. The little fool 
should have stayed out of it. This 
was no place for her. She’d have 
Old Hank out looking for her 
again, thinking she was kidnaped. 

The dusk was deepening. Only 
the far peak of the treetops caught 
the last rays of the sun. A coolness 
came stealing up the ravine from 
the valley far below and • there 
was a damp, lush smell from the 
ground. From some hidden hol- 
low a whippoorwill called mourn- 
fully. 

Enoch darted out from behind 
the birch clump and rushed up 
the slope. He reached the fallen 
log he’d picked as a barricade and 
threw himself behind it. There 
was no sign of the alien and there 
was not another shot from the 
laser-gun. 

Enoch studied the ground 
ahead. Two more rushes, one to 
that small pile of rock and the 
next to the edge of the boulder 
area itself, and he’d be on top of 
the hiding alien. And once he got 
there, he wondered, what was he 
to do. 

Perhaps, here in the open air, 
it could not use its stench defense 
as effectively as it had in the con- 
fines of the station. That might 



164 



GALAXY 



make it easier. He examined the 
clump of boulders from one edge 
to the other and there was nothing 
that might help him to locate the 
alien. 

Slowly he began to snake 
around, getting ready for the next 
rush up the slope, moving care- 
fully so that no sound would be- 
tray him. 

Out of the tail of his eye he 
caught the moving shadow that 
came flowing up the slope. Swiftly 
he sat up, swinging the rifle. But 
before he could bring the muzzle 
round, the shadow was upon him, 
bearing him back, flat upon the 
ground, with one great splay- 
fingered hand clamjjed upon his 
mouth. 

i6¥ TLYSSES!” ENOCH gur- 

^ gled, but the fearsome 
shape only hissed at him in a 
warning sound. 

Slowly the weight shifted off 
him and the hand slid from his 
mouth. 

Ulysses gestured toward the 
boulder pile and Enoch nodded. 

Ulysses crept closer and low- 
ered his head toward Enoch’s. He 
whispered, with his mouth inches 
from the Earthman’s ear: “The 
Talisman! He has the Talisman!” 

“The Talisman!” Enoch cried 
aloud, trying to strangle off the 
cry even as he made it, remem- 
bering that he should make no 
sound to let the watcher up above 



know where they might be in 
hiding. 

From the ridge above a loose 
stone rattled as it was dislodged 
and began to roll, bouncing down 
the slope. Enoch hunkered closer 
to the ground behind the fallen 
log. 

“Down!” he shouted to Ulysses. 
“Down! He has a gun.” 

But Ulysses’ hand gripped him 
by the shoulder. 

“Enoch!” he cried. “Enoch, 
look!” 

Enoch jerked himself erect and 
atop the pile of rock, dark against 
the skyline, were two grappling 
figures. 

“Lucy!” he shouted. 

For one of them was Lucy and 
the other was the alien. 

She sneaked up on him, he 
thought. The damn little fool, she 
sneaked up on him! While the 
alien had been distracted with 
watching the slope, she had slip- 
ped up close and then had tackled 
him. She had a club of some sort 
in her hand, an old dead branch, 
perhaps, and it was raised above 
her head, ready for a stroke, but 
the alien had a grip upon her 
arm and she could not strike. 

“Shoot,” said Ulysses, in a flat, 
dead voice. 

Enoch raised the rifle and had 
trouble with the sights because of 
the deepening darkness. And they 
were so close together! They were 
too close together. 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



165 



“Shoot!” yelled Ulysses. 

“I can’t,” sobbed Enoch. “It’s 
too dark to shoot.” 

“You have to shoot,” Ulysses 
said, his voice tense and hard. 
“You have to take the chance.” 
Enoch raised the rifle once 
again and the sights seemed 
clearer now and he knew the trou- 
ble was not so much the darkness 
as that shot which he had missed 
back there in the world of the 
honking thing that had strode its 
world on stilts. If he had missed 
then, he could as well miss now. 

The bead came to rest upon the 
head of the rat-like creature, and 
then the head bobbed away, but 
was bobbing back again. 

“Shoot!” Ulysses yelled. 

Enoch squeezed the trigger 
and the rifle coughed. Up atop the 
rocks the creature stood for a 
second with only half a head and 
with tattered gouts of flesh flying 
briefly like dark insects, zooming 
against the half-light of the west- 
ern sky. 

rNOCH DROPPED the gun 
and sprawled upon the earth, 
clawing his fingers into the thin 
and mossy soil, sick with the 
thought of what could have hap- 
pened, weak with the thankful- 
ness that it had not happened, 
that the years on that fantastic 
rifle range had at last paid off. 

How strange it is, he thought, 
how so many senseless things 



shape our destiny. For the rifle 
range had been a senseless. As 
senseless as a billiard table or a 
game of cards — designed for 
one thing only, to please the 
keeper of the station. And yet the 
hours he’d spent there had shaped 
toward this hour and end, to this 
single instant on this restricted 
slope of ground. 

The sickness drained away into 
the earth beneath him. Peace 
came stealing in upon him — the 
peace of trees and woodland soil 
and the first faint hush of night- 
fall. As if the sky and stars and 
very space itself had leaned close 
above him and was whispering 
his essential oneness with them. 
And it seemed for a moment that 
he had grasped the edge of some 
great truth and with this truth 
had come a comfort and a great- 
ness he’d never known before. 

“Enoch,” Ulysses whispered. 
“Enoch, my brother . .” 

There was something like a 
hidden sob in the alien’s voice and 
he had never, until this moment, 
called the Earthman brother. 

Enoch pulled himself to his 
knees and up on the pile of tum- 
bled boulders was a soft and won- 
drous light, as if a giant firefly had 
turned on its lamp and had not 
turned it off, but had left it burn- 
ing. 

The light was moving down 
across the rocks toward them and 
he could see Lucy moving with 



166 



GALAXY 



the light, as if she were walking 
toward them with a lantern in 
her hand. 

Ulysses’ hand reached out of 
the darkness and closed hard on 
Enoch’s arm. 

“Do you see?” he asked. 

“Yes, I see. What is . 

“It is the Talisman,” Ulysses 
said, enraptured, his breath rasp- 
ing in his throat. “And she is our 
new custodian. The one we’ve 
hunted through the years.” 

XXIII 

VT^OU DID not become accus- 
-*■ tomed to it, Enoch told him- 
self as they tramped up through 
the woods. There was not a mo- 
ment you were not aware of it. 
It was something that you wanted 
to hug close against yourself and 
hold there forever. Even when it 
was gone from you, you’d not for- 
get it, ever. 

It was something that was past 
all description. A mother’s love, 
a father’s pride, the adoration of 
a sweetheart, the closeness of a 
comrade — it was all of these, 
and more. It made the farthest 
distance near and turned the com- 
plex simple. It swept away all 
fear and sorrow, for all of there 
being a certain feeling of deep 
sorrow in it, as if one might feel 
that never in his lifetime would 
he know an instant like this, and 
that in another instant he would 



lose it and never would be able to 
hunt it out again. But that was 
not the way it was, for this as- 
cendant instant kept going on and 
on. 

Lucy walked between them. 
She held the bag that contained 
the Talisman close against her 
breast, with her two arms clasped 
about it, and Enoch, looking at 
her, in the soft glow of its light, 
could not help but think of a little 
girl carrying her beloved pussy 
cat. 

“Never for a century,” said 
Ulysses, “perhaps for many cen- 
turies, perhaps never, has it 
glowed so well. I, myself, cannot 
remember when it was like this. 
It is wonderful, is it not?” 

“Yes,” said Enoch. “It is won- 
derful.” 

“Now we shall be one again,” 
Ulysses said. “Now we shall feel 
again. Now we shall be a people 
instead of many people.” 

“But the creature that had it. .” 
“A clever one,” Ulysses said. 
“He was holding it for ransom.” 
“It had been stolen, then.” 

“We do not know all the cir- 
cumstances,” Ulysses told him. 
“We will find out, of course.” 
They tramped on in silence 
through the woods and far in the 
east one could see, through the 
treetops, the first flush in the sky 
that foretold the rising moon. 

“There is something,” Enoch 
said. 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



167 



“Ask me anything you like,” 
said Ulysses. 

“How could that creature back 
there carry it and not feel — feel 
no part of it? For if he could have, 
he would not have stolen it.” 

■'HERE IS only one in many 
billions,” Ulyssts said, “who 
can — how do you say it? — tune 
in on it, perhaps. To you and me 
it would be nothing. It would 
not respond to us. We could hold 
it in our hands forever and noth- 
ing would happen. But let that 
one in many billions lay a finger 
on it and it becomes alive. There 
is a certain rapport, a sensitivity 
— I don’t know how to say it — 
that forms a bridge between this 
strange machine and the cosmic 
spiritual force. It is not the ma- 
chine itself, you understand, that 
reaches out and taps the spiritual 
force. It is the living creature’s 
mind, aided by the mechanism, 
that brings the force to us.” 

A machine, a mechanism, no 
more than a tool — technological 
brother to the hoe, the wrench, 
the hammer — and yet as far a 
cry from these as the human 
brain was from that first amino 
acid which had come into being 
on this planet when the Earth 
was very young. One was tempt- 
ed, Enoch thought, to say that 
this was as far as a tool could 
go, that it was the ultimate in the 
ingenuity possessed by any brain. 



But that would be a dangerous 
way of thinking. Perhaps there 
was no limit. There might quite 
likely be no such condition as the 
ultimate; there might be no time 
when any creature or any group 
of creatures could stop at any 
certain point and say this is as 
far as we can go, there is no use 
trying to go further. For each new 
development produced, as side ef- 
fects, so many other possibilities, 
. so many other roads to travel, 
that with each step one took down 
any given road there were more 
paths to follow. There’d never be 
an end, he thought — no end to 
anything. 

They reached the edge of the 
field and headed up across it 
toward the station. From its up- 
per edge came the sound of run- 
ning feet. 

“Enoch!” a voice shouted out 
of the darkness. “Enoch, is that 
you?” 

Enoch recognized the voice. 

“Yes, Winslowe. What is 
wrong?” 

The mailman burst out of the 
darkness and stopped, panting 
with his running, at the edge of 
light. 

“Enoch, they are coming! A 
couple of carloads of them. But 
I put a crimp in them. Where the 
road turns off into your lane — 
that narrow place, you know. I 
dumped two pounds of roofing 
nails along the ruts. That’ll hold 



168 



GALAXY 



them for a while. But not for 
long, Enoch!” 

“Roofing nails?” Ulysses asked. 
“It’s a mob,” Enoch told him. 
“They are after me. The nails . .” 
“Oh, I see,” Ulysses said. “The 
deflation of the tires.” 

Winslowe took a slow step 
closer, his gaze riveted on the 
glow of the shielded Talisman. 
“That’s Lucy Fisher, ain’t it?” 
“Of course it is,” said Enoch. 
“Her old man came roaring 
into town just a while ago and 
said she was gone again. Up until 
then everything had quieted 
down and it was all right. But 
old Hank, he got them stirred up 
again. So I went down to the 
hardware store and got them roof- 
ing nails and I beat them here.” 
“This mob?” Ulysses asked. “I 
don’t . .” 

V|^IN SLO WE interrupted him, 
gasping in his eagerness to 
to tell all his information. 
“That ginseng man is up there, 
waiting at the house for you. He 
has a panel truck.” 

“That,” said Enoch, “would be 
Lewis with the Hazer’s body.” 
“He is some upset,” said Wins- 
lowe. “He said you were expecting 
him.” 

“Perhaps,” suggested Ulysses, 
“we shouldn’t just be standing 
here. It seems to my poor intellect 
that many things may be coming 
to a crisis.” 



“Say,” the mailman yelled. 
“What is going on here? What is 
that thing Lucy has and who’s 
this fellow with you?” 

“Later,” Enoch told him. “I’ll 
tell you later. There’s no time to 
tell you now.” 

“But, Enoch, there’s the mob.” 
“I’ll deal with them,” said 
Enoch, grimly, “when I have to 
deal with them. Right now, there’s 
something more important.” 

They ran up the slope, the 
four of them, dodging through the 
waist-high clumps of weeds. 
Ahead of them the station reared 
dark and angular against the eve- 
ning sky. 

“Tljey’re down there at the 
turn-off,” Winslowe gasped, 
wheezing with his running. “That 
flash of light down the ridge. That 
was the headlights of a car.” 
They reached the edge of the 
yard and ran toward the house. 
The black bulk of the panel truck 
glimmered in the glow cast by 
the Talisman. A figure detached 
itself from the shadow of the 
truck and hurried out toward 
them. 

“Is that you, Wallace?” 

“Yes,” said Enoch. “I’m sorry 
that I wasn’t here.” 

“I was a bit upset,” said Lewis, 
“when I didn’t find you waiting.” 
“Something unforeseen,” said 
Enoch. “Something that must be 
taken care of.” 

“The body of the honored one?” 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



169 



Ulysses asked. “It is in the truck?” 

Lewis nodded. “I am happy 
that we can restore it. I’m sorry 
we caused a fuss.” 

“We’ll have to carry him down 
to the orchard,” Enoch said. “You 
can’t get a car in there.” 

“The other time,” Ulysses said, 
“you were the one who carried 
him.” 

Enoch nodded. 

“My friend,” the alien said, “I 
wonder if on this occasion I could 
be allowed the honor.” 

“Why, yes, of course,” said 
Enoch. “He would like it that 
way.” 

And the words came to his 
tongue, but he choked them back, 
for it would not have done to 
say them — the words of thanks 
for lifting from him the necessity 
of complete recompense, for the 
gesture which released him from 
the utter letter of the law. 

At his elbow, Winslowe said: 
“They are coming. I can hear 
them down the road.” 

He was right. 

From down the road came the 
soft sound of footsteps padding 
in the dust, not hurrying, with no 
need to hurry, the insulting and 
deliberate treading of a monster 
so certain of its prey that it need 
not hurry. 

Enoch swung around and half 
lifted his rifle, training it toward 
the padding that came out of the 
dark. 



OEHIND HIM, Ulysses spoke 
softly: “Perhaps it would be 
most proper to bear him to the 
grave in the full glory and un- 
shielded light of our restored 
Talisman.” 

“She can’t hear you,” Enoch 
said. “You must remember she is 
deaf. You will have to show her.” 

But even as he said it, a blaze 
leaped out that was blinding in its 
brightness. 

With a strangled cry, Enoch 
half turned back to face the little 
group that stood beside the truck. 
The bag that had enclosed the 
Talisman lay at Lucy’s feet. She 
held the glowing brightness high 
and proudly so that it spread its 
light across the yard and the an- 
cient house, and some of it as 
well spilled out into the field. 

There was a quietness. As if 
the entire world had caught its 
breath and stood attentive and in 
awe, waiting for a sound that did 
not come, that would never come, 
but would always be expected. 

And with the quietness came 
an abiding sense of peace that 
seemed to seep into the very fiber 
of one’s being. It was no synthetic 
thing — not as if someone had 
invoked a peace and peace then 
was allowed to exist by suffrance. 
It was a present and an actual 
peace, the peace of mind that 
came with the calmness of a sun- 
set after a long, hot day, or the 
sparkling, ghost-like shimmer of 



170 



GALAXY 



a springtime dawn. You felt it 
inside of you and all about you 
and there was the feeling that it 
was not only here, but that the 
i peace extended on and out in all 
directions, to the farthest reaches 
of infinity and that it had a depth 
which would enable it to endure 
1 until the final gasp of all eternity. 
Slowly, remembering, Enoch 
turned back to face the field. 

The men were there, at the 
edge of the light cast by the Talis- 
man, a gray, huddled group, like 
a pack of chastened wolves that 
slunk at the faint periphery of a 
campfire’s light. 

And as he watched, they 
I melted back — back into the 
deeper dark from which they had 
padded in the dust track of the 
road. 

Except for one who turned and 
bolted, plunging down the hill in 
the darkness toward the woods, 
howling in maddened terror like 
a frightened dog. 

“There goes Hank,” said Wins- 
! lowe. “That is Hank running 
I down the hill.” 

j “I am sorry that we frightened 
I him,” said Enoch soberly. “No 
; man should be afraid of this.” 

“It is himself that he is fright- 
ened of,” the mailman said. “He 
lives with a terror in him.” 

And that was true, thought 
Enoch. That was the way with 
Man; it had always been that 
way. He had carried terror with 



him. And the thing he was afraid 
of had always been himself. 

XXIV 

nPHE GRAVE was filled and 
mounded. The five of them 
stood for a moment more, listen- 
ing to the restless wind that 
stirred in the moon-drenched ap- 
ple orchard, while from far away, 
down in the hollows above the 
river valley, the whippoorwills 
talked back and forth through the 
silver night. 

In the moonlight Enoch tried 
to read the graven line upon the 
rough-hewn tombstone, but there 
was not light enough. Although 
there was no need to read it; it 
was in his mind: 

Here lies one from a distant 
star, but the soil is not alien to 
him, for in death he belongs to 
the universe. 

When you wrote that, the 
Hazer diplomat had told him, just 
the night before, you wrote as one 
of us. And he had not said so, but 
the Vegan had been wrong. For it 
was not a Vegan sentiment alone; 
it was human, too. 

The words were chiseled awk- 
wardly and there was a mistake 
or two in spelling, for the Hazer 
language was not an easy one to 
master. The stone was softer than 
the marble or granite most com- 
monly used for gravestones. The 
lettering would not last In a few 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



171 



more years the weathering of 
sun and rain and frost would blur 
the characters. In some years af- 
ter that they would be entirely 
gone, with no more than the 
roughness of the stone remaining 
to show that words had once been 
written there. But it did not mat- 
ter, Enoch thought. The words 
were graven on more than stone 
alone. 

He looked across the grave at 
Lucy. The Talisman was in its 
bag once more and the glow was 
softer. She still held it clasped 
tight against herself and her face 
was still exalted and unnoticing 
— as if she no longer lived in the 
present world, but had entered 
into some other place, some other 
far dimension where she dwelled 
alone and was forgetful of all 
past. 

“Do you think,” Ulysses asked, 
“that she will go with us? Do you 
think that we can have her? Will 
the Earth . .” 

“The Earth,” said Enoch, “has 
not a thing to say. We Earth peo- 
ple are free agents. It is up to 
her.” 

“You think that she will go?” 

“I think so,” Enoch said. “I 
think this has been the moment 
she had sought for all her life.” 

For she always had been in 
touch with something outside of 
human ken. You sensed it, but 
you could not name it; and she 
had fumbled with it, trying to use 



it and not knowing how, charm- 
ing off warts and healing poor 
hurt butterflies and only God 
knew what other acts that she 
performed unseen. 

“Her parent?” Ulysses asked. 
“The howling one that ran away 
from us?” 

“I’ll handle him,” said Lewis. 

“You want her to go back with 
you to Galactic Central?” Enoch 
asked. 

“If she will,” Ulysses said. “Cen- 
tral must be told at once.” 

.“And from there throughout 
the galaxy?” 

“Yes,” Ulysses said. “We need 
her very badly.” 

“Could we, I wonder, borrow 
her for a day or two.” 

“Borrow her?” 

“Yes,” said Enoch. “For we 
need her, too. We need her worst 
of all.” 

“Of course,” Ulysses said. “But 
I don’t . .” 

“Lewis,” Enoch asked, “do you 
think our government — the sec- 
retary of state, perhaps — might 
be persuaded to appoint one Lucy 
Fisher as a member of our peace 
conference delegation?” 

Lewis stammered, made a full 
stop, then began again: “I think 
it could possibly be managed.” 

“Can you imagine,” Enoch 
asked, “the impact of this girl and 
the Talisman at the conference 
table?” 

“I think I can,” said Lewis. “But 



172 



GALAXY 



the secretary undoubtedly would 
want to talk with you before he 
arrived at his decision.” 

Enoch half turned toward 
Ulysses, but he did not need to 
phrase his question. 

“By all means,” Ulysses said to 
Lewis. “Let me know and I’ll sit 
in on the meeting. And you might 
tell the good secretary, too, that 
it would not be a bad idea to 
begin the formation of a world 
committee.” 

“A world committee?” 

“To arrange,” Ulysses said, “for 
the Earth becoming one of us. We 
I cannot accept a custodian, can 
(j we, from an outside planet?” 

I N THE moonlight the tumbled 
boulder pile gleamed whitely, 
like the skeleton of some prehis- 
toric beast. For here, near the 
edge of the cliff that towered 
above the river, the heavy trees 
thinned out and the rocky point 
stood open to the sky. 

Enoch stood beside one of the 
massive boulders and gazed down 
at the huddled figure that lay 
among the rocks. Poor, tattered 
I bungler, he thought, dead so far 
; from home — and to so little pur- 
pose. 

1 In that brain, now broken be- 
I yond recovery, must have lain a 
f scheme of greatness — the kind 
' of scheme that the brain of an 
earthly Alexander or Xerxes or 
Napoleon may have held, a 



dream of great power, cynically 
conceived, so grandiose that it 
canceled moral considerations. 

He tried momentarily to imag- 
ine what the scheme might be, but 
knew how foolish it was to try. 

It was ironic that the key of 
failure lay in the fact that the 
creature, in its fleeing, had carried 
the Talisman into the backyard 
of a sensitive, and on a planet, 
too, where no one would have 
thought to look for a sensitive. 
For there could be little doubt 
that Lucy had sensed the Talis- 
man, drawn to it as truly as a 
magnet would attract a piece of 
steel. She had known nothing else, 
perhaps, than that the Talisman 
had been there and was some- 
thing she must have, that it was 
something she had waited for in 
all her loneliness, without know- 
ing what it was or without hope 
of finding it. Like a child who 
sees, quite suddenly, a shiny, 
glorious bauble on a Christmas 
tree and knows that it’s the 
grandest thing on Earth and that 
it must be hers. 

This creature lying here, 
thought Enoch, must have been 
able and resourceful. For it would 
have taken great ability and re- 
sourcefulness to have stolen the 
Talisman to start with, to keep it 
hidden for years, to have pene- 
trated into the secrets and the 
files of Galactic Central. Would 
it have been possible, he won-

173 



dered, if the Talisman had been 
in effective operation? With an 
energetic Talisman would the 
moral laxity and the driving 
greed have been possible to moti- 
vate the deed? 

But that was ended now. The 
Talisman had been restored and 
a new custodian had been found 
— a deaf-mute girl of Earth, the 
humblest of humans. And there 
would be peace on Earth and in 
time the Earth would join the 
confraternity of the galaxy. 

^T^HERE WERE no problems 
•*- now, he thought. No decisions 
to be made. Lucy had taken the 
decisions from the hands of every- 
one. 

The station would remain. He 
could unpack the boxes he had 
packed and put the journals back 
on the shelves again. He could 
go back to the station once again 
and settle down and carry on his 
work. 

I am sorry, he told the huddled 
shape that lay among the boul- 
ders. I am sorry that mine was 
the hand that had to do it to you. 

He turned away and walked 
out to where the cliff dropped 
straight down to the river flowing 
at its foot. He raised the rifle 
and held it for a moment motion- 
less and then he threw it out and 
watched it fall, spinning end for 
end, the moonlight glinting off 
the barrel, saw the tiny splash it 



made as it struck the water. And 
far below, he heard the smug, 
contented gurgling of the water 
as it flowed past this cliff and 
went on to the ends of Earth. 

There would be peace on 
Earth, but it was a long trail yet, 
a long and lonesome way. 

Until no man ran howling, wild 
with fear (any kind of fear), 
would there be actual peace. Un- 
til the last man threw away his 
weapon (any sort of weapon), 
the tribe of Man could not be at 
peace. A rifle was the least of 
the weapons of the Earth, the 
least of man’s inhumanity to man 
— and to others. 

He stood on the rim of the 
cliff and looked out across the 
river and the dark shadow of the 
wooded valley. His hands felt 
strangely empty with the rifle 
gone, but it seemed that some- 
where, back there just a way, he 
had stepped into another field of 
time, as if an age or day had drop- 
ped away and he had come into a 
place that was shining and brand 
new and unsullied by any past 
mistakes. 

The river rolled below him and 
the river did not care. Nothing 
mattered to the river. It would 
take the tusk of mastodon, the 
skull of saber-tooth, the ribcage 
of a man, the dead and sunken 
tree, the thrown rock or rifle and 
would swallow each of them and 
cover them in mud or sand and 



174 



GALAXY 




roll gurgling over them, hiding 
them from sight. 

A million years ago there had 
been no river here and in a mil- 
lion years to come there might 
be no river — but in a million 
years from now there would be, 
if not Man, at least a caring thing. 
And that was the secret of the 
universe, Enoch told himself — 
a thing that went on caring. 

He turned slowly from the cliff 
edge and clambered through the 



boulders, to go walking up the 
hill. He heard the tiny scurrying 
of small life rustling through the 
fallen leaves. Once there was the 
sleepy peeping of an awakened 
bird, and through the entire 
woods lay the peace and comfort 
of that glowing light. Not so in- 
tense, not so deep and bright and 
so wonderful as when it actually

had been there, but a breath of 
it still left. 

He came to the edge of the 
woods and climbed the field. 
Ahead of him the station stood 
foursquare upon its ridgetop. And 
it seemed that it was no longer a 
station only, but his home as well. 
Many years ago it had been a 
home and nothing more and then 
it had become a way station to 
the galaxy. 

But now, although way station 
still, it was home again. 

XXV 

STATION was quiet and 

just a little ghostly. A lamp 
burned on his desk and over on 
the coffee table the little pyramid 
of spheres was flashing, throwing 
its many colored lights, like the 
crystal balls they’d used in the 
Roaring Twenties to turn a dance 
hall into a place of magic. The 
tiny flickering colors went flitting 
all about the room, like the dance 
of a zany band of Technicolor 
fireflies. 

He stood for a moment, inde- 
cisive, not knowing what was 
missing. All at once he realized 
what it was. During all the years 
there’d been a rifle to hang upon 
its pegs or to lay across the desk. 
And now there was no rifle. 

He’d have to settle down, he 
told himself, and get back to 
work. He’d have to unpack and 



put the stuff away. He’d have to 
get the journals written and catch 
up with his reading. There was a 
lot to do. 

Ulysses and Lucy had left an 
hour or two before, bound for 
Galactic Central, but the feeling | 
of the Talisman still seemed to 
linger in the room. Perhaps not 
in the room at all, but inside him- 
self. Perhaps it was a feeling that 
he’d carry with him no matter 
where he went. 

He walked slowly across the 
room and sat down on the sofa. 

In front of him the pyramid of 
spheres was splashing out its crys- 
tal shower of colors. He reached 
out a hand to pick it up, then 
drew it slowly back. What was 
the use, he asked himself, of ex- 
amining it again? If he had not 
learned its secret the many times 
before, why should he expect to 
now? 

A pretty thing, he thought, but 
useless. 

He wondered how Lucy might 
be getting on and knew she was 
all right. She’d get along, he told 
himself, anywhere she went. 

Instead of sitting here, he 
should be getting back to work. 
From now on Earth would be 
pounding at the door. There 
would be conferences and meet- 
ings and a lot of other things and 
in a few hours more the news- 
papers might be here. But before 
it happened, Ulysses would be 



back to help him, and perhaps 
there would be others, too. 

In just a little while he’d rustle 
up some food. and then he’d get 
to work. If he worked far into 
the night, he could get a good 
deal done. 

Lonely nights were good for 
work. And it was lonely now. 

"IJE ROSE and walked to the 
desk and picked up the sta- 
uette Winslowe had carved of 
him. He held it beneath the desk 
lamp and turned it slowly in his 
hands. There was loneliness in 
^ that figure, too — the essential 
f loneliness of a man who walked 
alone. 

But he’d had to walk alone. 
There’d been no other way. 

! He set the statuette back on 
the desk and remembered that he 
had not given Winslowe the piece 
of wood the Thuban traveler had 
brought. Now he could tell Wins- 
lowe where all the wood had 
come from. They could go 
through the journals and find the 
dates and the origin of every stick 
of it. That would please Old 
Winslowe. 

He heard the silken rustle and 
swung swiftly round. 

“Mary!” he cried. 

She stood just at the edge of 
shadow. The flitting colors from 
the flashing pyramid made her 
seem like someone who had step- 
ped from fairyland. And that was 

HERE GATHER THE STAR 



right, he was thinking wildly, for 
his lost fairyland was back. 

“I had to come,” she said. “You 
were lonely, Enoch, and I could 
not stay away.” 

She could hot stay away. That 
might be true, he thought. For 
within the conditioning he’d set 
up there might have been the in- 
escapable compulsion to come 
whenever she was needed. 

It was a trap, he thought, from 
which neither could escape. There 
was no free will here, but instead 
the deadly precision of this blind 
mechanism he had shaped him- 
self. 

She should not come to see him 
and perhaps knew this as well 
as he, but could not help herself. 
Would this be the way that it 
would be, forever and forever? 

He stood there, frozen, torn by 
the need of her and the emptiness 
of her unreality, and she was 
moving toward him. 

She was close to him. In a 
moment she would stop, for she 
knew the rules as well as he; she, 
no more than he, could admit il- 
lusion. 

But she did not stop. She came 
so close that he could smell the 
apple blossom fragrance of her. 
She put out a hand and laid it 
on his arm. 

It was no shadow touch and it 
was no shadow hand. He could 
feel the pressure of her fingers 
and the coolness of them.

He stood rigid, with her hand 
upon his arm. 

The flashing light! he thought. 
The pyramid of spheres! 

rOR NOW he remembered 
who had given it to him. It 
was one of those aberrant races of 
the Alphard system. And it had 
been from the literature of that 
system that he had learned the 
art of fairyland. They had tried 
to help him by giving him the 
pyramid and he had not under 
There had been a failure of com- 
munication, an easy thing to hap- 
pen in the Babel of the galaxy. 

For the pyramid of spheres was 
a wonderful and simple mecha- 
nism. It was the fixation agent 
that banished illusion. It made a 
fairyland real. You made some- 
thing as you wanted it and then 
turned on the pyramid — and 
you had what you had made, as 
real as if it had never been illu- 
sion. 

Except, he thought, in some 
things you couldn’t fool yourself. 
You knew it was illusion, even if 
it should turn real. 

He reached out toward her ten- 
tatively, but her hand dropped 
from his arm and she took a slow 
step backward. 

In the terrible, lonely silence 
of the room they stood facing one 
another, while the colored lights 
ran like playing mice as the pyra- 
mid twirled its rainbow. 



“I am sorry,” Mary said. “It 
isn’t any good. We can’t fool our- 
selves.” 

He stood mute and shamed. 

“I waited for it,” she said. “I . 
thought and dreamed about it.” 
“So did I,” said Enoch. “I never 
thought it would happen.” 

And that was it, of course. So 
long as it could not happen, it 
was a thing to dream about, ro- 
mantic and impossible. Perhaps 
it had. been romantic only be- 
cause it had been so far-off and 
impossible. 

“As if a doll had come to life,” 
she said, “or a beloved teddy 
bear. I am sorry, Enoch, but you 
could not love a doll or a teddy 
bear that had come to life. You 
always would remember them 
the way they were before. The 
doll with the silly, painted smile; 
the teddy bear with the stuffing 
coming out of it.” 

“No!” cried Enoch. “No!” 

“Poor Enoch,” she said. “It will 
be so bad for you. I wish that I 
could help. You’ll have so long 
to live with it.” 

“But you!” he cried. “But you? 
What can you do now?” 

It had been she, he thought, 
who had the courage that it took 
to face things as they were. 

How, he wondered, had she 
sensed it? How could she have 
known? 

“I shall go away,” she said. “I 
shall not come back. Even when 



178 



GALAXY 



you need me, I shall not come 
back. There is no other way.” 

“But you can’t go away! You 
are trapped the same as I.” 

She shook her head, moved 
swiftly and the pyramid of 
spheres was in her hand and lifted. 

“No, not that!” he shouted. 
“No, Mary!” 

The pyramid flashed, spinning 
in the air, and crashed against 
the fireplace. 

The flashing lights went out. 
Something — glass? metal? stone? 
— tinkled on the floor. 

“Mary!” Enoch cried, striding 
forward in the dark. 

But there was no one there. 

“Mary!” he whimpered. 

She was gone and she would 
not be back. Even when he 
needed her, she would not be 
back. 

He stood quietly in the dark 
and silence. The voice of a cen- 
tury of living seemed to speak 
to him. All things are hard, it 
said. Nothing is easy. 

There had been the farm girl 
living down the road, and the 
southern beauty who had watched 
him pass her gate, and now there 
was Mary, gone forever from him. 



He turned heavily in the room 
and moved forward, groping for 
the table. He found it and 
switched on the light. 

He stood beside the table and 
looked about the room. In this 
corner where he stood there once 
had been a kitchen, and there, 
where the fireplace stood, the liv- 
ing room, and it all had changed 
— it had been changed for a long 
time now. But he still could see it 
as if it were only yesterday. 

All the days were gone and all 
the people in them. 

Only he was left. 

He had lost his world. He had 
left it behind him. 

But so, on this day, had all the 
other humans alive. They might 
not know it. But they, too, had 
left their world behind them. 

“Good-by, Mary,” he said. 
“Forgive me. God keep you.” 

He sat down at the table and 
pulled the journal that lay upon 
its top in front of him. He flipped 
it open, searching for the pages 
he must fill. 

He had work to do, and now 
he was ready for it. 

He had said his last good-by.

THE IMMENSE AND THE OUTRAGEOUS 



T^EXT to the unresolved ques- 
’ tion, “What is science fic- 
tion?”, the most fascinating ar- 
gument in the field is that 
concerning sf as literature, or, as 
some people prefer to call it, as 
Art. A great many of those who 
hold that the best of sf stands up 
with the best of any literature, 
seem to lose sight of the fact 
that it is perforce different from 
other fields. If it weren’t there’d 
be no fen, no Cons, no Hugo. 
My own objections to the lay- 

180 



man’s attitude has come down to 
this: good sf out of the main 
stream, like On the Beach or Fail 
Safe, ought to be acknowledged 
as such. Likewise, good literature 
within our field ought to be recog- 
nized as such. 

What brings out these cogita- 
tions just now is the appearance 
of two remarkable books, wildly 
different one from the other, and 
from most of anything you have 
ever read, yet both works of real 
stature. 

GALAXY 



L 



Harry Martinson is one of the 
Immortals of the Swedish Acad- 
emy. In 1953 he published a 
short volume of “songs” called 
Cicada, a version of which formed 
the libretto for an opera per- 
formed at the Edinburgh Festival 
in ’59 and at Covent Garden, 
London, in 1960. Aniara (Knopf, 
133 pp., $4.00) contains the 29 
“songs” of Cicada and a great 
many more, to total 103. 

Aniara is the story of a space- 
ship loaded with four thousand 
immigrants from Earth to Mars. 
It encounters asteroids, is flung 
off course and damaged so that 
it can’t be turned. The whole 
book, then, is an examination of 
bottled-up humanity in an abso- 
lutely inescapable predicament 
which can end only in death. We 
see them in the sixth, the ninth 
and the twentieth years, in epi- 
sodes of fad and fashion, of re- 
ligion, of love and fear. 

I have read somewhere that 
Swedish is not a language that 
lends itself to literary excellence. 
Either this is not so, or the trans- 
lators (Hugh Macdiarmid and 
Elspeth Harley Schubert) are 
people of unusual literary skill; 
for the language is simply beau- 
tiful. I nominate for anyone’s 
high shelf of immortal lines-out- 
of-context (like, “Forever shalt 
thou love, and she be fair,” and 
“. a rose-red city, half as old 
as Time,”) this from Aniara: 



She wounds, but as a rose may 
wound, not always, as expected, 
with its thorn. A rose will always 
wound you with its rose . 

Martinson’s achievement here 
is an inexpressible, immeasurable 
sadness. It is something that tran- 
scends panic and terror and even 
despair, which is after all a roiling 
and acidulous condition. He 
leaves you in the quiet immen- 
sities, with the feeling that you 
have spent time, and have been 
permanently tinted, by and with 
an impersonal, larger-than-God 
force which is inimical exactly to 
the extent that you are alive and 
have being. 

I cannot and will not accept 
Martinson’s profound disgust with 
humanity : 

. describe the men who there 
in beauty stitched the white 
shrouds of their race until God 
and Satan hand in hand from a 
defiled and poisoned land past 
plains and mountains fled the 
face of man; the King of Ashes. 

— preferring to regard this and 
other documents, (like 1984, or 
Jean Genet’s The Balcony) as 
terrifying and accurate projec- 
tions of what might be, and there- 
fore informative of how to change 
course actively and with purpose. 
Nevertheless I feel personally en- 
riched and enlarged by this book, 
one which I shall surely always 
keep and read and ponder.

I^NE-TIME sf-ist Philip Wylie, 
who went on to hate middle- 
aged ladies for a living, called 
his greatest book, Finnley Wren, 
“a novel in a new manner.” It’s 
a nice concept, and a challenging 
one — to write a novel in a new 
manner. 

I know a guy who has done it 
twice. Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., whose 
Sirens of Titan is a perfect exam- 
ple of the piece of fine literature 
denied the general public by its 
Buck Rogers syndrome, has done 
it again with Cat’s Cradle (Holt, 
231 pp., $3.95). The 231 pages of 
this outrageous novel (on the dust 
jacket the word “novel” bears an 
asterisk for a footnote; the foot- 
note reads “a harmless untruth”) 
contain no less than 127 chapters. 
Some have such titles as Commu- 
nists, Nazis, Royalists, Parachut- 
ists and Draft Dodgers and run 
all of nine short paragraphs; yet 
the author never deceives (not 
in this manner, anyhow) and 
you’ll find the chapter does in- 
deed deal with Communists, 
Nazis, etc., etc. Throughout the 
book are quotations from a 
skewed gospel called The Books 
of Bokonon, which may just pos- 
sibly be Vonnegut’s impertinent 
way of demanding who’s to say 
whose gospels are skewed? “Live 
by the foma,” says Bokonon, 
“that make you brave and kind 
and healthy and happy.” Foma 
are harmless untruths. 



The narrative on which the 
book’s appalling, hilarious, shock- 
ing and infuriating events and 
characters are strung deals with 
a great scientist, now dead, the 
search for biographic material by 
a free-lance writer, his encounter 
with the scientist’s past employ- 
ers, acquaintances and fellow- 
townspeople, and his children: an 
angry midget, an ugly daughter 
who plays fabulous clarinet, and 
a moral degenerate who has be- 
come the weak power behind the 
meaningless throne of a tropical 
island called San Lorenzo. The 
writer goes to San Lorenzo 
spurred primarily by a Sunday 
supplement picture of the ward 
of the dictator, the most beautiful 
girl in the word. He finds himself 
affianced to her; and how would 
you feel if your beloved’s idea of 
you-know-what was to take off 
your shoes, and you take off her 
shoes, and there you sit with the 
soles of your feet pressing to- 
gether in ecstasy? 

Along with these highest of 
jinks goes the grim specter of 
Ice-nine, a scientific development 
of horrendous proportions, about 
which I will say not one more 
word. I will and must say, how- 
ever, that this is an annoying 
book, and you must read it. 

And you better take it lightly, 
because if you don’t you’ll go off 
weeping and shoot yourself.

¥NGOMAR Bjorgson knew he 
■*• was going to die. 

He turned his back on his use- 
less ship and went inside the bub- 
ble house that had been his home 
for ninety-nine days. Methodical- 
ly he donned his all-weather 
clothes, his environment suit. He 
did not want to die in this place. 
Here was food and refrigeration 
for the days, warmth and com- 
fort for the nights. He could not 
bring himself to put a gun to his 
head, or end it by any other di- 
rect, willful act. But out there in 
the desert, away from man-made 
helps for survival ... there a man 
could get himself into circum- 
stances where nature took care 
of it. 

That was his reason for being 
here on this lonely planet, in the 
first place — the promise of find- 
ing intelligent life. For intelli- 
gence was rare in the universe, 
after all. A lone adventurer, a 
year before, forced down on this 
planet by a cosmic storm, had 
waited a week here for the storm 
to subside, then had landed on 
Earth with the feverish news of 
intelligent life. Ingomar Bjorgson 
had come to investigate. 

Birds, yet. 

T hey were only two. Two 
birds with minds like the 
edge of a razor, living alone on 
this planet that was one hundred 
per cent desert. 



OF LORRANE 



185 





He took one last look around 
the bubble, then walked out, 
leaving the door open. From ten 
feet away he watched the sand 
already blowing in through the 
doorway, and he felt very lonely 
and small. He knew that his 
death, like his life, would never 
be marked anywhere with any 
degree of permanence. 

He walked. There was no hur- 
ry, so he walked slowly, stopping 
occasionally to turn and stare at 
the tracks his feet had scuffed in 
the sand, watching sand drift in- 
to them. He smiled wryly. The 
universe was so eager to be rid 
of him — as if he were a disease. 

He looked up again, studying 
the whole sky. But there was no 
movement of wings, no silver 
streak of a ship coming to pick 
him up. Only one spot marred 
the desert’s domain — the tiny 
bright reflection of the burning 
sun on the now distant bubble. 

The birds had promised him. 
They had been so sure of them- 
selves. 

When he knew that the fierce 
sun and wind would kill him be- 
fore he could get back to the 
bubble, he started removing his 
all-weather clothes. He flung 
them aside like a dancer. Coat 
to the left, trousers to the right. 
The hot wind threw the trousers 
back against his face. He tore 
them off with a curse. Shirt to 
the left. He kept the shoes on. 



out of respect for his feet. Then 
he trudged on, wondering vague- 
ly how a half dressed man, dying 
on his feet, could make the same 
marks in the sand as a fully 
clothed, comfortable one. 

He stumbled on an outcrop- 
ping of rock. He fell. He picked 
himself up again. It would be 
quick, after all. The sun was in 
league with the rest of the uni- 
verse. He would die soon. 

He fell again. 

He had found the planet of 
Lorrane easily. The adventurer’s 
charts were accurate. It was a 
dry, barren place, an old, worn- 
out world where only wind and 
sand moved, where mountains 
shoved their eroded peaks into 
the impotent sky. But Ingomar 
found, upon emerging from his 
ship, that there was another 
movement. Two black dots ap- 
peared far away in the sky and 
rapidly grew larger. He had been 
told that the planet was popu- 
lated by an intelligent form of 
bird life. Two were approaching 
now. 

He smiled to himself. “Imagine 
that,” he said to himself, “A 
smart bird. How should you meet 
a smart bird? Should you shake 
hands?” 

The birds alighted in the sand 
before him. They eyed him with 
bright, intelligent eyes. They 
were quite large, standing at 
least two feet tall. Their gray 



186 



GALAXY 



feathers lay smooth and straight, 
immaculately cared for. Ingomar 
cast around in his mind for some- 
thing to say, or some sign to 
make that indicated friendship. 

Then one of the birds looked 
at the other and said, “This one is 
larger.” 

“Much,” the other replied. 

Ingomar was astonished. “You 
can talk?” he asked, “In Eng- 
lish?” 

“Certainly. Didn’t the first man 
tell how he instructed us?” 

“Yes, yes, of course,” Ingomar 
said, confused. “But I didn’t re- 
mem . that is . Well, I didn’t 
believe it.” 

The birds eyed each other 
again. “I like him,” one said. “If 
there’s anything I hate, it’s a 
completely honest person.” 

The other gave him a vicious 
peck on his back. “Shut up!” it 
said, “Do you want him to think 
we condone dishonesty?” 

“Of course not,” the other re- 
torted hotly, “I just meant that, 
considering social protocol, it is 
sometimes kind to tell a very 
small lie.” 

TNGOMAR was speechless. He 
looked back at his ship, 
standing tall and straight, ready 
to blast itself into the sky again. 
He glanced around at the lonely 
landscape. Finally he said, “It is 
difficult to see a difference be- 
tween you two. Do you have 



names that I might be able to 
use?” 

“Oh, yes. We beg your pardon. 
How uncivil of us. Our name, 
translated into your tongue, is 
Pisces.” 

“The fish?” 

“Well,” they said, “from our 
home planet the constellation 
does not look like a fish.” 

“Oh. Well, are both of you 
named Pisces? Oh, I see. That is 
your species. I am called Man; 
you are called Pisces.” 

“Of course not,” they said, 
“You were right the first time. 
Pisces is our name. You can say, 
‘Pisces, get me that ship.’ And 
we would do so.” 

“How can both of you have 
the same name? Are you actually 
one intelligence? And see that 
you keep your hands ... I mean, 
see that you leave my ship 
alone.” 

One said, “We wouldn’t think 
of touching your ship.” The 
other said, “No, we are two sep- 
arate entities.” 

Ingomar passed a hand over 
his face, thinking. The two very 
Earth-looking birds stood quietly 
before him, their feet buried in 
the sand so that it looked like 
their legs were two stilts shoved 
into the ground. At last he said, 
“Well, I know what we’ll do. I 
will call you Pisces I,” he pointed 
to the bird on his left, “and your 
companion Pisces II.” 



THE BIRDS OF LORRANE 



187 



The identical birds glanced at 
each other, then leapt into the 
air. They circled high above his 
head. They swooped low. They 
engaged in marvelous aerial gym- 
nastics wonderful to see. Ingomar 
made notes in his book concern- 
ing their agility. Finally they 
came to rest before him again, so 
suddenly that he stepped back- 
ward quickly, frightened. 

“Now,” they said, “which one 
of us is Pisces I and which is 
Pisces II?” 

Puzzled, Ingomar studied 
them carefully. The one with the 
quick temper might show this 
characteristic in some way. He 
pointed to the bird on his right. 
“You,” he said, “are Pisces I”. 

They laughed. It was a verbal 
sound only. No expression 
showed in their eyes. 

44 A LL right,” Ingomar said, 
after some thought. “I can 
fix that.” He entered his ship and 
rummaged around in his clothes 
locker, then emerged with a bril- 
liant red ribbon of plastic. “I’ll 
tie this to your leg. That way I’ll 
know that you are Pisces I. If 
you promise not to move it from 
one to the other.” ^ 

“We promise.” 

He stooped over to tie the 
plastic on the leg of the one he 
thought was Pisces I, and was al- 
most caught in the sudden flurry 
of slashing beaks and raking 



claws, like a mating fight in an 
aviary. 

“I am Pisces I,” one screamed, 
administering a resounding peck 
on the other’s back. 

“No, you’re hot. I am.” This 
one leapt into the air and landed 
on the other’s back. He raked 
vicious, long talons across the 
well-groomed feathers. “I am 
more intelligent than you. / 
should be Pisces I.” 

From a safe ten feet away, In- 
gomar threw the ribbon at them. 
“Stop it!” he yelled. 

They obeyed instantly, and 
stood quietly side by side facing 
him. Ingomar drew his hand gun 
and pointed it at them. “Now 
stop your fighting, or I’ll blow 
you to kingdom come.” 

“Fine,” they said. “Anything to 
get off this miserable planet. How 
far is it?” 

Ingomar smiled, in spite of his 
anger. “It’s an expression. It 
means I will destroy you.” 

One of the birds quickly 
picked up the plastic ribbon and 
carried it to the other, and 
dropped it near the leg. Then 
both took it in their beaks and 
together they tied it around the 
leg. It was done so quickly that 
Ingomar stood there aghast, sur- 
prised into immobility. He had 
never before seen birds tie knots. 

“It would not be wise to de- 
stroy us,” Pisces I said. ‘We can 
help you.” 



188 



GALAXY 



“How?” 

“You need help,” Pisces II 
said. “A storm is coming.” 

“A cosmic §torm?” Ingomar 
asked. “I’m not worried about 
that. I’ll stay here until it moves 
on.” 

Pisces I shook his head. “A 
planetary storm.” 

“When?” 

“Sometime tonight.” 

“Okay,” Ingomar said. 
“Thanks. I’ll stay inside.” 

“It’s not so easy as that. You 
must blast off and put your ship 
in orbit for the night.” 

“Why? Do you know how 
much fuel it takes to get into 
orbit? I have none to spare.” 
Pisces II scratched in the sand 
with his claws, thinking. Then he 
said, “Only one alternative exists. 
If you remain, the storm will 
wreck your ship. Take us aboard 
now, and blast off for your home 
planet. To stay here means 
death.” 

Ingomar snorted and turned 
back toward his ship. He thought, 
“Take them aboard my ship? 
Not in a million years.” He saw 
their plan, now. They wanted to 
get into his ship. Then, by some 
means he could not now forsee, 
they would take the ship away 
from him. 

TTE WAS so shaken by this 
conclusion that he quickly 
retreated to safety, closing the 



airlock. The birds stayed outside. 
They were arguing between 
themselves. He could tell by the 
gesticulations they made with 
their heads. Once Pisces I at- 
tacked Pisces II viciously, raking 
him mercilessly with sharp ta- 
lons. Pisces II fought back fero- 
ciously. They rolled over and 
over in the sand. Ingomar threw 
a switch that gave him communi- 
cation outside, the ship, and 
yelled at them. 

They stopped fighting at once. 
He said, “Have you two lost your 
minds?” 

Pisces II laughed. “Now how 
could one lose his mind? It goes 
with him everywhere.” 

“All right,” Ingomar said. “I 
meant, have you become in- 
sane?” 

“Of course not,” Pisces I said. 
“We are peaceful entities. We in- 
tentionally developed this argu- 
ment to break the monotony of 
life here.” 

“Is it so bad as that?” 

“It is terrible. Will you take 
us aboard?” 

Ingomar did not answer, but 
switched the communicator off 
and busied himself with record- 
ing his observations. He took ad- 
vantage of their continued pres- 
ence and took photographs. 

Finally, after several hours, 
they leapt into the air and flew 
away toward the distant moun- 
tains. Ingomar was sorry to see 



THE BIRDS OF LORRANE

them leave, and more than once 
checked his instruments for signs 
of a coming storm in case they 
were right. But nothing outside 
had changed. 

After they had left he opened 
the ship and stepped outside, tak- 
ing readings with instruments to 
record the character of the planet. 
He trudged through the eternally 
drifting sand, looking for some 
sign of life. No plants, insects, 
animals anywhere. Only the fine, 
mobile sand, occasionally an out- 
cropping of rock not yet eroded 
away. And the heat! Ingomar 
was forced to turn the controls 
of his environment suit almost all 
the way up to keep comfortable. 
Then, when the sun receded be- 
hind the ghostly barren moun- 
tains, the cold came creeping in. 
Ingomar turned his controls in 
the other direction, while walking 
back to his ship. He was afraid he 
would not keep the cold outside. 

The landscape, with the sun’s 
absence, was dark and. fearful. 
Shadows moved in the wind, 
shadows of drifting sand that 
took on the shapes of monsters 
lurking in the darkness. Ingomar 
was not one to frighten easily, 
but the night took on such omi- 
nous sighs and moans and move- 
ments that his imagination be- 
gan to magnify them beyond rec- 
ognition. When he finally saw 
the ship loom up before him he 
ran, stumbling toward it. He 



fumbled in the darkness for the 
control knob to open the lock 
and found it at last. He leapt in- 
side, accompanied by a cold blast 
of wind and sand, and stood there 
panting, hearing his heart pound 
in his ears. 

The night was long and lonely. 
He was too far from civilization 
for his radio equipment to bring 
the comfort of familiar sounds. 
He tried to read, but found con- 
centration impossible. He thought 
of the birds, wondering where 
they were now, how they kept 
from freezing to death at night. 
He rewrote his notes, adding re- 
membered facts and impressions. 
Finally he decided sleep was the 
most painless way of spending 
the night, and swallowed a small 
capsule designed to induce total 
sleep for at least six hours. 

TTE awoke the next morning 
standing on his head. 

The bed, horizontal the night 
before, was now vertical. The 
whole room was vertical. Panic 
swept over him like a wave of 
burning fire. He scrambled to the 
airlock. It opened grotesquely. 

The ship, which last night 
had stood so proudly, now lay on 
its side. And in his drugged sleep 
he had not known when it fell. 
For Ingomar, the bottom dropped 
out of everything, and his heart 
dropped with it. There was no 
resetting of a ship once it had 



190 



GALAXY 



fallen. This took special equip- 
ment. Ingomar Bjornson was a 
doomed man, and he knew it. 

While he stood outside in the 
morning sun, staring at the hor- 
rible spectacle before him, the 
two birds alighted, one on each 
side. 

“Why didn’t you listen to us?” 
Pisces I said in an accusing tone. 

“Yes,” Pisces II echoed angrily. 
“You make me sick, thinking 
you’re so smart, coming down 
here in your big ship and strut- 
ting around like you think you’re 
a God, or something. Now, how 
big do you feel? Do you realize 
that this is our first opportunity 
to leave this planet? I’ve a good 
notion to peck your stupid eyes 
out right here and now.” 

“Leave him be,” Pisces I said. 
“He may not be so bright, but I 
think he would have taken us 
with him, after he got used to us 
and saw how harmless we are.” 
Pisces II leapt at him, almost 
knocking Ingomar off his feet. 
“Shut up! I’ve a good notion to 
peck your eyes out, too.” 

“Oh, stop it!” Ingomar said 
wearily. “We’re all doomed to 
spend the rest of our lives here. 
How was I to know that the 
storm would be so bad? My in- 
struments gave no indication 
whatever.” 

“Actually, it was our fault,” 
Pisces II said, more calmly. “We 
failed to mention the nature of 



the storm. We thought you knew. 
It was a magnetic storm. A shift- 
ing of magnetic currents sur- 
rounding the planet. We had no 
idea that you would think of the 
weather.” 

They walked with him around 
the fallen ship. It was not in- 
jured, that much Ingomar could 
see. The soft bed of sand had 
cushioned its fall. If it could only 
be righted! Ingomar knew it was 
impossible. 

“It is pointed toward that knoll 
out there. See? Suppose we all 
got inside and blasted off. We 
would slide along and maybe 
when we reached the knoll we’d 
have enough speed to keep on 
going in a straight line until we 
could point her nose upward.” 
Ingomar shook his head, but 
he appreciated the suggestion. It 
indicated that they were willing 
to try anything. He knew their 
motives were not entirely philan- 
thropic, but he liked them more 
for it, anyway. 

He said, “There is only one 
way out, and that is for some- 
one to come in and get us.” 
“Well,” Pisces II said, “What 
are you waiting for? Call them.” 
“I can’t. We are too far out for 
communication.” 

The two gray birds eyed one 
another in disbelief. Pisces I 
scratched his breast impolitely. 
Then he said, “Are you telling us 
that you have come this far from 



THE BIRDS OF LORRANE 



191 




your own solar system, knowing 
that you could not call for help, 
if necessary?” 

Ingomar nodded. 

¥)ISCES II snorted through his 
beak, and scratched in the 
sand. “Stupidity,” he said. “There 
is no other word for it.” 

“Yes, there is,” Pisces I an- 
swered, somewhat sharply. “In 
fact, there are several possible 
words. Bravery. Desperation. Ac- 
tually I think it is a combination 
of both. I am sure that you are 
aware how rare intelligent life is 
in the universe. When you heard 
of us, you rushed out here at 
once. I would call it bravery to 
go beyond the sound of the voices 



of your kind. You are desperate 
because you are lonely in an al- 
most empty universe.” 

“We must help him,” said 
Pisces II. 

“Of course. But first let’s make 
him comfortable. It will be a 
long wait.” 

“Thank you,” Ingomar said, 
moved by their sympathy. “But 
you cannot help. Or do you have 
a way to send messages?” 

“Yes, in a way,” Pisces II said, 
“You see . .” 

Pisces I lifted a huge wing and 
knocked Pisces II in the sand. He 
turned to Ingomar. “Do you 
promise to take us with you, if 
we should succeed in getting 
help?” 



192 



GALAXY 



Ingomar did not think it over. 
“Yes,” he said. 

“Then we will do it. But first 
we must make you comfortable. 
Do you have equipment for 
shelter, besides the ship?” 

“Yes, there is the bubble. It 
can be expanded to become a 
house.” 

“Get it,” Pisces II said. 
Ingomar did. He dragged it 
outside and began to unfold it, 
in preparation for inflation. But 
Pisces II stopped him. “Not here,” 
he said. “It will be a long time. 
Our calculation is that it will take 
at least forty-five days to get 
help. The trip from your planet 
alone is at least forty days. You 
will not wish to stare at your 
toppled ship for so long. I suggest 
we go beyond the first knoll.” 
Pisces I laughed and said to 
Ingomar, “For once he is using 
his brain. We will carry it.” 

He grasped the bubble in his 
claws, flapped his enormous 
wings and sailed off. Soon he re- 
turned, and among the three of 
them all his food and books and 
any equipment he might need 
was carried over the knoll out of 
sight of the wrecked ship. 

“We will not return,” they said, 
“until the rescue ship arrives. So 
make yourself comfortable. Do 
not stray too far from the ship. 
This is the most miserable planet 
in the universe. Give us plenty of 
time. We know we can summon 



help, but we do not know how 
long it will take. We may need 
as many as seventy-five days.” 
Ingomar settled down to wait. 

T he fierce, burning sun had 
turned Ingomar’s face and 
naked arms into fried areas of 
intense pain, but he regained con- 
sciousness when he felt the cool- 
ness of the ointment. It pene- 
trated deep down, under the 
burned skin, into flesh and mus- 
cle, soothing injured cells. 

He opened his eyes. He moved 
his head. The eyes were burned 
and bloodshot, but he could see 
a ship standing a hundred feet 
away. It was not sleek and long, 
pointing its needle nose at the 
sky, though. It was round, dull 
white, like a giant egg laid by a 
giant bird. 

Bird? Ingomar chuckled, 
senses returning, thinking through 
his pain of Pisces I or Pisces II 
laying an egg. Then he laughed 
aloud. 

He stopped, quite abruptly, 
and looked again. The egg was 
still there, but it was not an egg. 
It was actually a ship and the 
airlock was open and Pisces II 
was backing out, dragging a sort 
of stretcher on wheels. 

“It’s a . a . ship!” he ex- 
claimed, tears running down his 
cheeks, over the ointment. 
“Whose ship is it?” 

“Ours,” said Pisces I. 



THE BIRDS OF LORRANE 



193 



“Yours?” Ingomar said, after a 
long pause while the pain raged 
over his skin. He tried to sit up, 
and Pisces I got behind him and 
pushed, nudging him upright. 
“Where did you get it?” 

“Oh,” Pisces II interrupted. 
“We had it all the time.” 

“Shut up!” Pisces I yelled. “He 
asked me.” 

“Hold your tongue,” Pisces II 
retorted hotly, “or I’ll take off 
and leave you here. I’ve had 
enough of you in the past century 
to last a lifetime.” 

Pisces I said to Ingomar, “Pay 
no attention to that p>easant.” He 
helped Pisces II push the stretch- 
er next to Ingomar. Then he 
pushed a lever and the stretcher 
reduced itself to ground height. 
It was too short for Ingomar’s 
body, having been designed for 
the body of a bird. “He’s right, 
though,” Pisces I continued, giv- 
ing the stretcher a kick because 
it wasn’t long enough. “We had 
the ship all along. It was despic- 
able of us to deceive you, but our 
ship was defective, and we 
needed yours for parts.” 

Ingomar shook his head. 
“There was no magnetic storm?” 
Pisces II nodded his head. “Oh, 
yes, there was a storm. But not 
a natural phenomenon, I’m sorry 
to say. Too bad. The natural 
storms are much more beautiful.” 
“And you had the bubble set 
up away from 'the ship so I 



wouldn’t see you steal the parts?” 
They hung their heads. “De- 
spicable,” they said. “A rotten 
thing to do.” 

Ingomar was too ill for anger. 
“Let me understand this,” he 
said. “You ruined my ship to get 
parts for yours. Why? Why not 
just take my ship?” 

“Too slow,” Pisces II said. He 
took the container of ointment 
in his beak and set it beside In- 
gomar’s hand. “Here, you can rub 
it on by yourself now. Get busy.” 
Pisces I said. By your stand- 
ards our planet is a terrible dis- 
tance away. Your ship would 
take too long. Hurry, now. We’ve 
got to take you to . what do 
you call it. Earth? What an odd 
name! We’re in sort of a hurry to 
get home, as you might imagine.” 
Ingomar hurried. With the 
help of the mysterious, healing 
ointment he was soon able to get 
up and make his way to the ship. 

“One more question,” he said. 
“Your ship was defective and you 
set down here and you’ve been 
here for a long time, and you’re 
a long way from home. What 
were you doing so far from home, 
in the first place?” 

“What do you suppose?” said 
Pisces I irritably. “We were look- 
ing for intelligent life. Get a 
move on, now. If we don’t waste 
too much time on this Earth, we 
may still find some!”
