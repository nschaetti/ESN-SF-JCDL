“We want to test your writing aptitude” 



If you have ever wanted 
to write, here is your 
opportunity to find out if you 
have talent worth developing. 
Take this revealing 
Aptitude Test created 
by 1 5 famous authors 

By Rod Serling 

If you want to write, my colleagues and 
I would like to test your writing aptitude. 
We’ll help you find out if you have the 
talent it takes to become a successful 
writer. 

Several years ago, I joined together 
with Max Shulman, Faith Baldwin, Ben- 
nett Cerf, Bruce Catton, J. D. Ratcliff 
and several others to form the Famous 
Writers School. Our aim was to help 
qualified people acquire the skills they 
need to break into print. We poured 
everything we know about writing into a 
new kind of professional training course, 
which you take at home in your free time. 
After a solid grounding in the fundamen- 
tals of all good writing, you get advanced 
training in the specialty of your choice. 

Each of your writing assignments is 
examined by instructors who are them- 
selves professional writers or editors. 
Your instructor goes over your work 
word by word, blue-penciling corrections 
right on it— much as an editor does with 
established writers. Then he returns it to 
you with a long, personal letter of advice. 
This training works well. Our students 




Rod Serling, six-time Emmy Award 
winner, made TV writing an art form with 
Patterns, Requiem for a Heavyweight and 
Twilight Zone. He has also written many 
short stories and motion picture scripts. 

have sold their writing to hundreds of 
publications including Redbook and True. 

Free Aptitude Test offered 

To find out if you can benefit from this 
training, send for the School’s free Apti- 
tude Test. If you test well, or offer other 
evidence of writing ability you may en- 
roll. But there is no obligation.

Less than a year ago I was sur- 
prised to find that a scientist shar- 
ing a discussion panel with me did 
not know what I meant by science 
fiction. But after a few minutes 
during which I tried to summarize 
the field his face cleared. 

“Oh,” he said, with a mixture of 
nostalgia and contempt in his voice. 
“You mean Buck Rogers. Yeah, 1 
used to read that stuff every Sun- 
day.” 

It used to be the standard way 
of defining science fiction. “That 
Buck Rogers stuff.” Men who had 
never heard of Verne or Wells - 
much less of Asimov or Heinlein 
had read at least a few episodes of 
the comic strip widely syndicated 
between 1929 and 1967. Thus for a 
generation most people derived 



their ideas of space and rockets 
from the exploits of Buck Rogers 
and Wilma Deering. 

And during that generation, 
science-fiction writers and enthu- 
siasts tried to overcome that asso- 
ciation of their literature with its 
comic-strip relative. However nos- 
talgic they might be about their 
own first aquaintance with Buck, 
they felt the comparison was odi- 
ous. Maybe they were right, since 
most outsiders cited it with some 
contempt to dismiss the whole 
genre. 

In any case, now we can all take 
a second look at those daily strips.

Man had his choice of external 
environments— -and inner hells 



I 

S TEPHEN DEMEREST gazed 
up at the textured sky. He 
found the blue opaque and revolt- 
ing. 

He had unwarily looked at the 
sun, for there was nothing to 
blank it out automatically, and 
had snatched his eyes away in 
panic. He had not been blinded, 
but his vision swam with after- 
images. Even the sun was washed 
out. 

Involuntarily, he thought of 
Ajax’s prayer in Iliad : Make the 
sky clear, grant us to see with our 
eyes ! Kill us in the light, since it 
is thy pleasure to kill us! 

Demerest thought: Kill us in 
the light . 

Kill us in the^ clear light on the 
Moon, where the sky is black and 
soft, where the stars shine brightly, 
where the cleanliness and purity 
of vacuum sharpen the sight . 

— Not in this low-clinging, 
fuzzy blue. 

He shuddered. The shudder was 
physical and real — it shook his 
lanky body and he was annoyed. 
He was going to die. He was sure 
of it. And not under this blue sky 
but under black — and no sky. 

It was as though in answer to 
that thought that the ferry pilot, 
short, swarthy, crisp-haired, came 
up to him and said, “Ready for 
the black, Mr. Demerest?” 

Demerest nodded. He towered 
over the other as he did over most 



of the men of Earth. They were 
thick, all of them, and took their 
short, low steps with ease. He 
himself had to feel his footsteps, 
guide them through the air — even 
the impalpable bond that held him 
to the ground was textured. 

“I’m ready,” he said. He took 
a deep breath and deliberately re- 
peated his earlier glance at the 
sun. It stood low in the morning 
sky, washed out by dusty air, and 
he knew it wouldn’t blind him. 
He didn’t think he would ever see 
it again. 

He had never seen a bathy- 
scaphe before. He tended to think 
of it in terms of prototypes — an 
oblong balloon with a spherical 
gondola beneath. It was as though 
he persisted in thinking of space- 
flight in terms of tons of fuel 
spewed backward in fire and an 
irregular module feeling its way, 
spiderlike, toward the Lunar sur- 
face. 

The bathyscaphe was not like 
the image in his thoughts at all. 
Under its skin it might still be 
buoyant bag and gondola but it 
was all engineered sleekness now. 

“My name is Javan,” said the 
ferry pilot, “Omar Javan.” 

“Javan?” 

“Queer name to you? I’m Ira- 
nian by descent — Earthman by 
persuasion. Once you get down 
there nationalities cease to mat- 
ter.” He grinned and his com- 
plexion grew darker against the 
even whiteness of his teeth. “If

you don’t mind, we’ll be starting 
in a minute. You’ll be my only 
passenger so I guess you carry 
weight.” 

“Yes,” said Demerest, dryly, 
“At least a hundred pounds more 
than I’m used to.” 

“You’re from the Moon? I 
thought you had a queer walk on 
you. I hope it’s not uncomfort- 
able.” 

“It’s not exactly comfortable 
but I manage. We exercise for 
this.” 

“Well, come on board.” He 
stood aside and let Demerest 
walk down the gangplank. “I 
wouldn’t go to the Moon my- 
self.” 

“You go to Ocean-Deep.” 

“About fifty times, so far. 
That’s different.” 

Demerest got on board. The 
space was cramped but he didn’t 
mind that. The ’scaphe’s interior 
might be a space module’s except 
that it was more— well, textured. 
There was that word again. The 
overriding feeling was that mass 
didn’t matter. Mass was held up 
— it did not have to be hurled up. 

They were still on the surface. 
The blue sky could be seen green- 
ishly through the clear thick glass. 

Javan said, “You don’t have 
to be strapped in. There’s no ac- 
celeration. Smooth as oil, the 
whole thing. It won’t take long — 
just about an hour. You can’t 
smoke.” 



“I don’t smoke,” said Demer- 
est. 

“I hope you don’t have claus- 
trophobia.” 

“Moonmen don’t have claus- 
trophobia.” 

“All that open — ” 

“Not in our cavern. We live in 
a — ” he groped for the phrase— 
“Lunar-Deep, a hundred feet 
deep.” 

“A hundred feet?” The pilot 
seemed amused but he didn’t 
smile. “We’re slipping down 
now.” 

The interior of the gondola was 
fitted into angles but here and 
there a section of wall beyond the 
instruments seemed to be an ex- 
tension of his arms — his eyes and 
hands moved over them lightly, 
almost lovingly. 

“We’re all checked out,” he 
said, “b,ut I like a last minute 
lookover — we’ll be facing a thou- 
sand atmospheres down there.” 
His finger touched a contact, and 
the round door closed massively 
inward and pressed against the 
beveled rim it met. “The higher 
the pressure, the tighter that will 
hold. Take your last look at sun- 
light, Mr. Demerest.” 

The light still shone through the 
thick glass of the window. It was 
wavering now; there was water be- 
tween the Sun and themselves 
now. 

“The last look?” said Demerest. 

Javan snickered. “Not the last 
look. I mean for the trip. I sup-

pose you’ve never been on a bathy- 
scaphe before.” 

“No, I haven’t. Have many?” 
“Very few,” admitted Javan. 
“But don’t worry. It’s just an 
underwater balloon. We’ve intro- 
duced a million improvements 
since the first bathyscaphe. We’re 
nuclear-powered now and we can 
move freely by water jet up to cer- 
tain limits— but cut it down to 
basics and it’s still a spherical gon- 
dola under buoyancy tanks. And 
it’s still towed out to sea by a 
mother ship because it needs what 
power it carries too badly to waste 
any on surface travel. Ready?” 

T HE supporting cable of the 
mother ship flicked away and 
the bathyscaphe settled lower, 
then lower still, as seawater fed 
into the buoyancy tanks. For a 
few moments, caught in surface 
currents, it swayed, and then there 
was nothing. Neither sense of mo- 
tion nor lack of it. The bathy- 
scaphe sank slowly through a 
deepening green. 

Javan relaxed. 

He said, “John Bergen is head 
of Ocean-Deep. You’re going to 
see him?” 

“That’s right.” 

“He’s a nice guy. His wife’s 
with him.” 

“She is?” 

“Oh, sure. They have women 
down there. There’s a bunch down 
there, fifty people. Some stay for 
months.” 



Demerest put his finger on the 
narrow and nearly invisible seam 
where door met wall. He took it 
away and looked at it. He said, 
“It’s oily.” 

“Silicony, really. The pressure 
squeezes some out. It’s supposed 
to. Don’t worry. Everything’s 
automatic. Everything’s fail safe. 
The first sign of malfunction, any 
malfunction at all, our ballast is 
released and up we go.” 

“You mean nothing’s ever hap- 
pened to these bathyscaphes?” 
“What can happen?” The pilot 
looked sidewise at his passenger. 
“Once you get too deep for sperm 
whales, there’s nothing that can go 
wrong.” 

“Sperm whales?” Demerest’s 
thin face creased in a frown. 

“Sure. They dive as deep as 
half a mile. If they hit a bathy- 
scaphe — well, the walls of the 
buoyancy chambers aren’t par- 
ticularly strong. They don’t have 
to be, you know. They’re open to 
the sea and when the gasoline, 
which supplies the buoyancy, com- 
presses, seawater enters.” 

Darkness became tangible. 
Demerest found his gaze fastened 
to the viewport. The inside of the 
gondola was lighted but it was 
dark in that window. And the 
darkness was not the darkness of 
space — it was thick, solid. 

Demerest said sharply, “Let’s 
get this straight, Mr. Javan. You 
are not equipped to withstand the 
attack of a sperm whale. Presum- 




ably, you are not equipped to 
withstand the attack of a giant 
squid. Have there been any actual 
incidents of that sort?” 

“Well, it’s like this — ” 

“No games, please, and don’t 
try ragging the greenhorn. I am 
asking out of professional curios- 
ity. I am head safety engineer at 
Luna City and I am asking what 
precautions this bathyscaphe can 
take against possible collision 
with large creatures.” 

Javan looked embarrassed. He 
muttered, “Actually, there have 
been no incidents.” 

“Are any expected? Even as a 
remote possibility?” 

“Anything is remotely possible. 
But actually sperm whales are 
too intelligent to monkey with us 
and giant squid are too shy.” 

“Can they see us?” 

“Yes, of course. We’re lit up.” 
“Do you have floodlights?” 
“We’re already past the large- 
animal range but we have them. 
I’ll turn them on for you.” 

Beyond the black of the win- 
dow suddenly appeared a snow- 
storm, inverted, upward-falling. 
The blackness had come alive with 
stars in three-dimensional array 
and all moving upward. 

Demerest said, “What’s that?” 
“Just crud. Organic matter. 
Small creatures. They float, don’t 
move much, and they catch the 
light. We’re going down past 
them. They seem to be going up in 
consequence.” 



Demerest’s sense of perspective 
adjusted itself and he said, 
“Aren’t we dropping too quick- 
ly.” 

“No, we’re not. If we were I 
could use the nuclear engines if 
I wanted to waste power — or I 
could drop some ballast. I’ll be 
doing that later but for now 
everything is fine. Relax, Mr. 
Demerest. The snow thins as we 
drive and we’re not likely to see 
much in the way of spectacular 
life forms. There are small angler 
fish and such but they avoid us.” 

Demerest said, “How many do 
you take down at a time?” 

“I’ve had as many as four pas- 
sengers in this gondola but that’s 
crowded. We can put two bathy- 
scaphes in tandem and carry 
ten but that’s clumsy. What we 
really need are trains of gondolas, 
heavier on the nukes— the nuclear 
engines — and lighter on the buoy- 
ancy. Stuff like that is on the 
drawing board, they tell me. Of 
course, they’ve been telling me 
that for years.” 

“There are plans for large-scale 
expansion of Ocean- Deep, then?” 

“Sure, why not? We’ve got 
cities on the continental shelves — 
why not on the deep-sea bottom? 
The way I look at it, Mr. Demer- 
est, where man can go he will go 
and he should go. The Earth is 
ours to populate and we will pop- 
ulate it. All we need to make the 
deep sea habitable are completely 
maneuverable ’scaphes. The buoy- 



WATERCLAP

ancy chambers slow us, weaken us 
and complicate the engineering.” 

"‘But they also save you, don’t 
they? If everything went wrong 
at once the gasoline on board 
would still float you to the sur- 
face. What would do that for you 
if your nuclear engines went 
wrong and you had no buoyan- 
cy?” 

“If it comes to that — you can’t 
expect to eliminate the chances of 
accident altogether, not even fatal 
ones.” 

“I know that very well,” said 
Demerest feelingly. 

Javan stiffened. The tone of 
his voice changed, “Sorry. Didn’t 
mean anything by that. Tough 
about that accident.” 

Fifteen men and five women 
had died on the Moon. One of the 
individuals listed among the 
“men” had been fourteen years 
old. It had been pinned down to 
human failure. What could a head 
safety engineer say after that? 

“Yes,” he said. 

A pall dropped between the two 
men, a pall as thick and as turgid 
as the pressurized sea water out- 
side. How could one allow for 
panic, distraction and depression 
all at once? There were the Moon 
Blues — stupid name — but they 

struck men at inconvenient times. 
When the Moon Blues came was 
not always noticeable but it made 
men torpid and slow to react. 

How many times had a mete- 
orite come along and been averted 



or smothered or successfully ab- 
sorbed? How many times had a 
Moonquake done damage and 
been held in check? How many 
times had human failure been 
backed up and compensated for? 
How many times had accidents 
not happened? 

But you don’t pay off on acci- 
dents not happening. Now twenty 
were dead. 

II 

J AVAN said — how many long 
minutes later? — “There are the 
lights of Ocean-Deep.” 

Demerest could not make them 
out at first. He didn’t know where 
to look. Luminescent creatures 
had flicked past the windows twice 
before— at a distance and with 
the floodlight off again Demerest 
had thought them the first sign of 
Ocean-Deep. Now he saw nothing. 

“Down there,” said Javan, 
without pointing. He was busy 
now, slowing the drop and edging 
the ’scaphe sideways. 

Demerest could hear the dis- 
tant sighing of the water jets, 
steam-driven, the steam formed 
by the heat of momentary bursts 
of fusion power. 

Demerest’s thought had a filmy 
transparency. It did not distract 
him. 

Deuterium is their fuel and it’s 
all around them. Water is their 
exhaust and it's all around 
them .

IF 




Javan was dropping some of 
his ballast, too, and began a kind 
of distant chatter. 

“The ballast used to be steel 
pellets and they were dropped by 
electromagnetic controls. Any- 
where up to fifty tons of it were 
used in each trip. Conservationists 
worried about spreading rusting 
steel over the ocean floor — so we 
switched to metal nodules that are 
dredged up from the continental 
shelf. We put a thin layer of iron 
over them so they can still be 
electromagnetically handled and 
the ocean bottom gets nothing 
that wasn’t subocean to begin 
with. Cheaper, too. But when we 
get our real nuclear ’seaphes, we 
won’t need ballast at all.” 

Demerest scarcely heard him. 
Ocean-Deep could be seen now. 
Javan had turned on his floodlight 
and far below was the muddy floor 
of the Puerto Rican Trench. Rest- 
ing on that floor like a cluster of 
equally muddy pearls was the 
spherical conglomerate of Ocean- 
Deep. 

Each unit was a sphere such as 
the one in which Demerest was 
now sinking * toward contact — but 
much larger. As Ocean-Deep ex- 
panded — expanded — expanded, 
new spheres were added. 

They're only Jive and a half 
miles from home, not a quarter of 
a million . 

“How are we going to get 
through?” asked Demerest. 

The ’scaphe had made contact. 



Demerest had heard the dull 
sound of metal against metal but 
for minutes afterward the only 
sound had been a kind of occa- 
sional scrape as Javan bent over 
his instruments in rapt concentra- 
tion. 

“Don’t worry about that,” Ja- 
van said at last, in belated answer. 
“There’s no problem. The delay 
now is caused by my having to 
make sure we fit tightly. An elec- 
tromagnetic joint holds at every 
point of a perfect circle — when the 
instruments read correctly we fit 
over the entrance door.” 

“Which then opens?” 

“It would if there were air on 
the other side. But there isn’t. 
There’s sea-water and that has to 
be driven out. Then we enter.” 
Demerest did not miss this 
point. He had come here on this, 
the last day of his life, to give that 
same life meaning and he in- 
tended to miss nothing. 

He said, “Why the added step? 
Why not keep the airlock— ^if 
that’s what it is — a real airlock 
and have air in it at all times.” 
“They tell merit’s a matter of 
safety,” said Javan. “Your spe- 
cialty. The interface has equal 
pressure on both sides at all times, 
except when men are moving 
across. This door is the weakest 
point of the whole system because 
it opens and closes — it has joints 
— it has seams. You know what I 
mean?” 

“I do,” murmured Demerest. 



WATERCLAP 



11 




He saw a logical flaw here and 
that meant there was a possible 
chink through which — but later. 

He asked, “Why are we waiting 
now?” 

“The lock is being emptied. The 
water is being forced out.” 

“By air.” 

“Hell, no. They can’t afford to 
waste air like that. It would take 
a thousand atmospheres to empty 
the chamber of its water and fill-, 
ing the chamber with air at that 
density, even temporarily, takes 
more air than they can afford to 
expend. Steam is what does it.” 

“Of course. Yes.” 

Javan said cheerfully, “You 
heat the water. No pressure in the 
world' can stop water from turning 
to steam at a temperature of less 
than 374° C. And the steam forces 
the seawater out through a one- 
way valve.” 

“Another weak point,” said 
Demerest. 

“I suppose so. It’s opver failed 
yet. The water in the lock is being 
pushed out now. When hot steam 
starts bubbling out the valve the 
process automatically stops and 
the lock is full of overheated 
steam.” 

“And then?” 

“And then we have a whole 
ocean to cool it with. The temper- 
ature drops and the steam con- 
denses. Once that happens ordi- 
nary air can be let in at a pressure 
of one atmosphere. And then the 
door opens.” 



“How long must we wait?” 

“Not long. If anything were 
wrong sirens would be sounding. 
At least so they say. I never heard 
one in action.” 



S ILENCE held for a few min- 
utes. Then came a sudden 
sharp clap and a simultaneous 
jerk. 

Javan said, “Sorry, I should 
have warned you. I’m so. used to 
it, I forgot. When the door opens 
a thousand atmospheres of pres- 
sure on the other side forces us 
hard against the metal of Ocean- 
Deep. No electromagnetic force 
can hold us hard enough to pre- 
vent that last hundredth-of-an- 
inch slam.” 

Demerest unclenched his fist 
and released his breath. 

He asked “Is everything all 
right?” 

“The walls didn’t crack, if 
that’s what you mean. It sounds 
like doom, though, doesn’t it. It 
sounds even worse when I leave 
and the airlock fills up again. Be 
prepared for that.” 

But Demerest was suddenly 
weary. 

Let's get on with it — I don't 
want to drag it out. 

He asked, “Do we go through 
now?” 

“We go through.” 

The opening in the ’scaphe wall 
was round and small — even 
smaller than the one through 



12 



IF 




which they had originally entered. 
Javan went through it sinuously, 
muttering that it always made him 
feel like a cork in a bottle. 

Demerest had not smiled since 
he entered the ’scaphe. Nor did 
he really smile now but a corner 
of his mouth quirked at the 
thought that a skinny Moonman 
would have no trouble. 

He went through also, feeling. 
Javan’s hands firmly at his waist, 
helping him through. 

Javan said, “It’s dark in here. 
No point in introducing an ad- 
ditional weakness by wiring for 
lighting. But that’s why flashlights 
were invented.’’ 

Demerest found himself on a 
perforated walk, its stainless me- 
tallic surface gleaming dully. And 
through the perforations he could 
make out the wavering surface of 
water. 

He said, “The ^chamber hasn’t 
been emptied.’’ 

“You can’t do any better, Mr. 
Demerest. If you’re going to use 
steam to empty it you’re left with 
that steam. And to get the pres- 
sures necessary to do the emptying 
that steam must be compressed 
to about one third the density of 
liquid water. When it condenses 
the chamber remains one third 
full of water — but it’s water at 
just one-atmosphere pressure. 
Come on, Mr. Demerest.” 

J OHN BERGEN’S face wasn’t 
entirely unknown to Demerest. 



Recognition was immediate. Ber- 
gen, as head of Ocean-Deep for 
nearly a decade now, was a fa- 
miliar face on the TV screens of 
Earth — just as the leaders of Luna 
City had become familiar. 

Demerest had seen the head of 
Ocean-Deep both flat and in 
three-dimensions, in black-and- 
white and in color. Seeing him in 
life added little. 

Like Javan, Bergen was short 
and thickset, opposite in struc- 
ture to the traditional Lunar pat- 
tern of physiology. He was fairer 
than Javan by a good deal and his 
face was noticeably asymmetric, 
though his somewhat thick nose 
leaned a little to the right. 

He was not handsome. No 
Moonman would think he was. 
But then Bergen smiled and a 
sunniness emanated from him as 
he held out a large hand. 

Demerest extended his own thin 
one, steeling himself for a hard 
grip that did not come. Bergen 
shook hands and let go. 

He said, “I’m glad you’re here. 
We don’t have much in the way 
of luxury, nothing that will make 
our hospitality stand out. We 
can’t even declare a holiday in 
your honor but the spirit is there. 
Welcome!” 

“Thank you,” said Demerest 
softly. 

He remained unsmiling. He was 
facing the enemy and he knew it. 
Surely Bergen must know it also. 
His smile was hypocrisy.

And at that moment a clang 
like metal against metal sounded 
deafeningly and the chamber 
shuddered. Demerest leaped back 
and staggered against the wall. 
Bergen did not budge. 

He said quietly, “That was the 
bathyscaphe unhitching and the 
waterclap of the airlock filling. 
Javan ought to have warned you.” 
Demerest panted and tried to 
make his racing heart slow. 

“Javan did warn me. But I was 
still caught by surprise.” 

Bergen said, “Well, it won’t 
happen again for a while. We 
don’t often have visitors, you 
know. We’re not equipped for it 
and fight off all kinds of big 
wheels who think a trip down here 
would be good for their careers. 
Politicans of all kinds, chiefly. 
Your case is different, of course.” 

Is it? 

Demerest wondered. It had 
been hard enough to get permis- 
sion to make the trip down. His 
superiors back at Luna City had 
not approved in the first place 
and had scouted the idea that a 
diplomatic interchange would be 
of any use (“diplomatic inter- 
change” was what they had called 
it). And when he had overridden 
them he had run into Ocean- 
Deep’s reluctance to receive him. 

Persistence alone had made his 
present visit possible. 

Bergen said, “I suppose you 
have your junketing problems on 
Luna City, too?” 



Demerest said, “Your average 
politician isn’t as anxious to make 
a half-million-mile roundtrip as 
he is to make a ten-mile one.” 

“I can see that,” agreed Bergen, 
“and it’s more expensive out to 
the Moon, of course. In a way, 
this is the first meeting of inner 
and outer space. No ocean man 
has ever gone to the Moon as far 
as I know and you’re the first 
Moonman to visit a subsea sta- 
tion of any kind. No Moon man 
has even been to one of the settle- 
ments on the continental shelf.” 

“It’s a historic meeting, then,” 
said Demerest and tried to keep 
the sarcasm out of his voice. 

If any leaked through, Brand 
showed no sign. 

He rolled up his sleeves as 
though to emphasize his attitude 
of informality (or the fact that 
they were very busy, so that there 
would be little time for visitors?) 
and asked, “Do you want coffee? 
I assume you’ve eaten. Would you 
like to rest before I show you 
around? Do you want to wash up, 
for that matter, as they say euphe- 
mistically?” 

For a moment curiosity stirred 
in Demerest; yet not entirely aim- 
less curiosity. Everything in- 
volving the interface of Ocean- 
Deep with the outside world could 
be of importance. 

He spoke carefully. 

“How are sanitary facilities 
handled here?” 

“It’s cycled mostly — as on the 



14 



IF 




Moon, I imagine. We can eject if 
we want to or have to. Man has a 
bad record of fouling the environ- 
ment but as the only deep-sea 
station, what we eject does no per- 
ceptible damage. Adds organic 
matter.” 

He laughed. 

Demerest filed that away, too. 
Matter was ejected. Ejection 
mechanisms existed. Their work- 
ings might, be of interest and he, 
as a safety engineer, had a right 
to exhibit interest. 

“Actually,” he said, “I’m com- 
fortable at the moment. If you’re 
busy — ” 

“That’s all right. We’re always 
busy but I’m the least so — if you 
see what I mean. Suppose I show 
you around. We’ve got over fifty 
units here, each as big as this one, 
some bigger.” 

Demerest looked about. He saw 
angles everywhere but beyond the 
furnishings and equipment he 
detected signs of the inevitable 
spherical outer wall. Fifty units! 

“Build up,” went on Bergen, 
“over a generation of effort. The 
unit we’re standing in is actually 
the oldest and there’s been some 
talk of demolishing and replacing 
it. Some of the men say we’re 
ready for second-generation units 
but I’m not sure. It would be ex- 
pensive— everything’s expensive 

down here — and getting money 
out of the Planetary Project Coun- 
cil is always a depressing experi- 
ence.” 



Demerest felt his nostrils flare 
involuntarily and a spasm of an- 
ger shot through him. It was a 
thrust surely. Luna City’s misera- 
ble record with the PPC must be 
well known to Bergen. 

But Bergen went on, unnoticing. 

“I’m a traditionalist, too— just 
a little bit. This is the first deep- 
sea unit ever constructed. The 
first two people to remain over- 
night on the floor of an ocean 
trench slept here with nothing ex- 
cept a miserable portable fusion 
unit to work the escape hatch. 
I mean the airlock — we called it 
the escape hatch to begin with — 
and just enough controls for the 
purpose. Reguera and Tremont — 
those were the men. They never 
made a second trip to the bottom, 
either; stayed topside forever af- 
ter. Well, they served their pur- 
pose and both are dead now. And 
here we are with fifty people and 
with six months as the usual tour 
of duty. I’ve spent only two weeks 
topside in the last year and a 
half.” 

He motioned vigorously to De- 
merest to follow him, slid open a 
door that moved evenly into a re- 
cess to give access to the next 
unit. Demerest paused to examine 
the opening. He could detect no 
seams between the adjacent units. 

B ERGEN took note and said, 
“When we add on units 
they’re welded under pressure in- 
to the equivalent of a single piece

of metal and then reinforced. We 
can’t take chances as I’m sure you 
understand. I have been given to 
understand that you’re the chief 
safe — ” 

Demerest cut him off. 

“Yes,” he said, “We on the 
Moon admire your safety record.” 

Bergen shrugged. 

“We’ve been lucky. Our sympa- 
thy, by the way, on the rotten 
break you fellows had. I mean 
that fatal — ” 

Demerest cut him off again. 

“Yes.” 

Bergen, the Moonman decided, 
was either a naturally voluble man 
or else was eager to drown him in 
words and get rid of him. 

“The units,” said Bergen are 
arranged in a highly branched 
chain — three dimensional actual- 
ly. We have a map we can show 
you if you’re interested. Most of 
the end units represent living- 
sleeping quarters. For privacy, you 
know. The working units tend to 
be corridors as well, which is one 
of the embarrassments of having 
to live down here.” He gestured. 

“This is our library, part of it, 
anyway. Not big. But it holds our 
records on carefully indexed and 
computed microfilm, so that for 
its kind it’s not only the biggest in 
the world but the best and the 
only. And we have a special com- 
puter designed to handle the ref- 
erences to meet our needs exactly. 
It collects, selects, coordinates, 
weighs, then gives us the gist. We 



have another library, too, book 
films and even some printed vol- 
umes. But that’s for amusement.” 

A voice broke in on Bergen’s 
cheerful flow of talk. 

“John? May I interrupt?” 

Demerest started — the voice 
had come from behind him. 

Bergen said, “Annette — I was 
going to get you. This is Stephen 
Demerest of Luna City. Mr. De- 
merest, may I introduce my wife, 
Annette.” 

Demerest had turned. 

He said stiffly, a little mechani- 
cally, “I’m pleased to meet you, 
Mrs. Bergen.” 

But he was staring at her waist- 
line. 

Annette Bergen seemed in her 
early thirties. Her brown hair was 
combed simply and she wore no 
makeup. Attractive, not beauti- 
ful, Demerest noted vaguely. But 
his eyes kept returning to that 
waistline. 

She shrugged. 

“Yes, I’m pregnant, Mr. De- 
merest. I’m due in about two 
months.” 

“Pardon me,” Demerest mut- 
tered. “So rude of me — I did 
not—” 

His voice faded. He felt as 
though the blow had been a physi- 
cal one. He hadn’t expected wom- 
en, though he didn’t know why. 
He knew there would have to be 
women in Ocean-Deep. And the 
ferry pilot had said Bergen’s wife 
was with him. 



16 



IF 




Annette Bergen remained silent 
and Demerest stammered when he 
asked, “How many women are 
there in Ocean-Deep, Mr. Ber- 
gen?” 

“Nine at the moment,” said 
Bergen. “All wives. We look for- 
ward to a time when we can have 
the normal ratio of one to one, but 
we still need workers and research- 
ers primarily and unless women 
have important qualifications of 
some sort — ” 

“They all have important qual- 
ifications of some sort, dear,” said 
Mrs. Bergen. “You could keep the 
men for longer duty if — ” 

“My wife,” said Bergen, laugh- 
ing, “is a convinced feminist but 
is not above using sex as an ex- 
cuse to enforce equality. I keep 
telling her that that is the femi- 
nine way of doing it and not the 
feminist way, and she keeps say- 
ing that’s why she’s pregnant. You 
think it’s love, sex mania, yearn- 
ing for motherhood? Nothing of 
the sort. She’s going to have a ba- 
by down here to make a philo- 
sophical point.” 

Annette said coolly. “Why not? 
Either this is going to be home for 
humanity or it isn’t going to be. If 
it is, we’re going to have babies 
here, that’s all. I want a baby 
born in Ocean-Deep. There are 
babies born in Luna City, aren’t 
there, Mr. Demerest.” 

Demerest took a deep breath, “I 
was born in Luna City, Mrs. Ber- 
gen.” 



“And well she knew it,” mut- 
tered Bergen. 

“And you are in your late twen- 
ties, I think?” she said. 

“I am twenty-nine,” said De- 
merest. 

“And well she knew that, too,” 
said Bergen with a short laugh. 
“You can bet she looked up all 
possible data on you when she 
heard you were coming.” 

“That is quite beside the point,” 
said Annette. “The point is that 
for twenty-nine years at least chil- 
dren have been born in Luna City 
and no children have been born in 
Ocean-Deep.” 

“Luna City, my dear,” said 
Bergen, “is longer established. It 
is over half a century old — we are 
not yet twenty.” 

“Twenty years is quite enough. 
It takes a baby nine months.” 

Demerest interposed. “Are 
there any children in Ocean- 
Deep?” 

“No,” said Berg. “No. Some 
day, though.” 

“In two months, anyway,” said 
Annette Bergen, positively. 

Ill 

T HE tension grew inside De- 
merest and when they re- 
turned to the unit in which he had 
first met Bergen he was glad to sit 
down and accept a cup of coffee. 

“We’ll eat soon,” said Bergen 
matter-of-factly. “I hope you 
don’t mind sitting here, mean-

while. As the prime unit this place 
isn’t used for much except, of 
course, for the reception of ves- 
sels, an item I don’t expect will in- 
terrupt us for a while. We can talk 
if you wish.” 

“I do wish,” said Demerest. 

“I hope I’m welcome to join 
in,” said Annette. 

Demerest looked at her doubt- 
fully but Bergen said to him, 
“You’ll have to agree. She’s fas- 
cinated by you and by Moonmen 
generally. She thinks they’re — uh 
— you’re a new breed. I think that 
when she’s quite through being a 
Deepwoman she wants to be a 
Moonwoman.” 

“I just want a word in edge- 
wise, John, and when I get that 
in, I’d like to hear what Mr. De- 
merest has to say. What do you 
think of us, Mr. Demerest?” 

Demerest said cautiously, “I’ve 
asked to come here, Mrs. Bergen, 
because I’m a safety engineer. 
Ocean-Deep has an enviable safe- 
ty record.” 

“Not one fatality in almost 
twenty years,” said Bergen cheer- 
fully. “Only one death by acci- 
dent in the C-shelf settlements 
and none in transit by either sub 
Or ’scaphe. I wish I could say, 
though, that this was the result of 
wisdom and care on our part. We 
do our best, of course, but the 
breaks have been with us- ” 

“John,” said Annette, “I really 
wish you’d let Mr. Demerest 
speak.” 



“As a safety engineer,” said 
Demerest, “I can’t afford to be- 
lieve in luck and breaks. We can- 
not stop Moonquakes or large me- 
teorites out at Luna City but we 
are designed to minimize the ef- 
fects even of those. There are no 
excuses or there should be none 
for human failure. We have not 
avoided failure on Luna City — 
our record recently has been — ” 
his voice dropped — “bad. While 
humans are imperfect, as we all 
know, machinery should be de- 
signed to take that imperfection 
into account. We lost twenty men 
and women needlessly.” 

“I know. Still, Luna City has a 
population of nearly one thou- 
sand, doesn’t it? Your survival 
isn’t in danger.” 

“The people on Luna City num- 
ber nine hundred and seventy-two, 
including myself — but our survi- 
val is in danger. We depend on 
Earth for essentials. That need not 
always be so. It wouldn’t be so 
right now if the Planetary Project 
Council could resist the tempta- 
tion toward pygmy economies — ” 

“There, at least, Mr. Demer- 
est,” said Bergen, “we see eye to 
eye. We are not self-supporting, 
either, and we could be. What’s 
more, we can’t grow much beyond 
our present level unless nuclear 
’scaphes are built. As long as we 
are bound to the buoyancy princi- 
ple we are limited. Transportation 
between Deep and Top is slow — 
slow for men, slower still for ma-

terial &nd supplies. I’ve been 
pushing, Mr. Demerest, for — ” 

“Yes, and you’ll be getting it 
now, Mr. Bergen, won’t you?” 

“I hope so. But what makes you 
so sure?” 

“Mr. Bergen, let’s not play 
around. You know very well that 
Earth is committed to spending a 
fixed amount of money on expan- 
sion projects — on programs de- 
signed to expand the human habi- 
tat — and that it is not a terribly 
large amount. Earth’s population 
is not going to lavish resources in 
an effort to expand either outer 
space or inner space if it thinks 
this will cut into the comfort and 
convenience of the prime habitat 
of humans — the land surface of 
Earth.” 

Annette broke in. 

“You make Earthmen sound 
callous, Mr. Demerest, and that’s 
unfair. It’s only human, isn’t it, to 
want to be secure? Earth is over- 
populated and is only slowly re- 
versing the havoc inflicted on the 
planet by the mad Twentieth. 
Surely man’s original home must 
come first, ahead of either Luna 
City or Ocean-Deep. Heavens, 
Ocean-Deep is almost home to me 
— but I don’t want to see it flour- 
ish at the expense of Earth’s 
land.” 

“It’s not an either-or, Mrs. Ber- 
gen,” said Demerest earnestly. “If 
the ocean and outer space are 
firmly, honestly and intelligently 
exploited, it can only rebound to 



Earth’s benefit. A small invest- 
ment will be lost but a large one 
will redeem itself with profit.” 
Bergen held up his hand. “Yes, 
I know. You don’t have to argue 
with me on that point. You’d be 
trying to convert the converted. 
Come, let’s eat. I tell you what. 
We’ll eat here. If you’ll stay with 
us overnight, or several days for 
that matter — you’re quite welcome 
— there will be ample time to meet 
everybody. Perhaps you’d rather 
take it easy for a while, though.” 
“Much rather,” said Demerest. 
“Actually, I want to stay here. I 
would like to ask, by the way, why 
I met so few people when we went 
through the units.” 

“No mystery/’ said Bergen, ge- 
nially. “At any given time, some 
fifteen of our men are asleep and 
perhaps fifteen more are watching 
films or playing chess or, if their 
wives are with them — ” 

“Yes, John,” said Annette. 

“ — and it’s customary not to 
disturb them. The quarters are 
constricted and what privacy a 
man can have is cherished. A few 
are out at sea — three right now, I 
think. That leaves a dozen or so at 
work in here and you met them.” 
“I’ll get lunch,” said Annette, 
rising. 

She smiled and stepped through 
the door, which closed automati- 
cally behind her. 

B ERGEN looked after her. 
“That’s a concession. She’s

playing woman for your sake. Or- 
dinarily, it would be just as likely 
for me to get the lunch. The choice 
is not defined by sex but by the 
striking of random lightning.” 
Demerest said, “The doors be- 
tween units, it seems to me, are of 
dangerously limited strength.” 
“Are they?” 

“If an accident happened and 
one unit were punctured — ” 

Bergen smiled. 

“No meteorites down her?.” 

“Oh yes, wrong word. If there 
were a leak of any sort, for any 
reason, could a unit or a group of 
units be sealed off against the full 
pressure of the ocean?” 

“You mean, the way Luna City 
can have its component units au- 
tomatically sealed off in case of 
meteorite puncture in order to 
limit damage to a single unit.” 
“Yes,” said Demerest, with a 
faint bitterness. “As did not hap- 
pen recently.” 

“In theory we could do that — 
but the chances of accident are 
much less down here. As I said, 
there are no meteorites and, 
what’s more, there are no currents 
to speak of. Even an earthquake 
centered immediately below us 
would not be damaging since we 
make no fixed or solid contact 
with the ground beneath and are 
cushioned by the ocean itself 
against the shocks. So we can af- 
ford to gamble on no massive in- 
flux.” 

“Yet if one happened?” 



“We could be helpless. You see, 
it is not so easy to seal off compo- 
nent units here. On the Moon 
there is a pressure differential of 
just one atmosphere — one atmo- 
sphere inside and the zero atmo- 
sphere of vacuum outside. A thin 
seal is enough. Here at Ocean- 
Deep the pressure differential is 
roughly a thousand atmospheres. 
To secure absolute safety against 
that differential would take a 
great deal of money and you know 
what you said about getting mon- 
ey out of PPC. So we gamble. 
And so far we’ve been lucky.” 

“And we haven’t,” said Demer- 
est. 

Bergen looked uncomfortable 
but Annette distracted both men 
by coming in with lunch at this 
moment. 

She said, “I hope, Mr. Demer- 
est, that you’re prepared for Spar- 
tan fare. All our food in Ocean- 
Deep is prepackaged and requires 
only heating. We specialize in 
blandness and nonsurprise and 
the nonsurprise of the day is a 
bland chicken a la king, with car- 
rots, boiled potatoes, a piece of 
something that looks like a brown- 
ie for dessert and, of course, all 
the coffee you can drink.” 

Demerest rose to take his tray 
and tried a smile. 

“It sounds very like Moon fare, 
Mrs. Bergen, and I was brought 
up on that. We grow our own mi- 
croorganismic food. It is patriotic 
to eat it but not particularly en- 



20 



IF 




joyable. We hope to keep improv- 
ing it, though.” 

“I’m sure you will improve it.” 

Demerest said, as he ate with a 
slow and methodical chewing, “I 
hate to ride my specialty but how 
secure are you against mishaps in 
your airlock entry?” 

“It is the weakest point of 
Ocean-Deep,” said Bergen. He 
had finished eating and was near- 
ly through with his first cup of 
coffee. “But there’s got to be an 
interface, right? The entry is as 
automatic as we can make it and 
as fail safe. Number one: there 
has to be contact at every point 
about the outer lock before the 
fusion generator begins to heat the 
water within the lock. What’s 
more, the contact has to be metal- 
lic and of a metal with just the 
magnetic permeability we use on 
our ’scaphes. Presumably, a rock 
or some mythical deep-sea mon- 
ster might drop down and make 
contact at just the right places — 
but if so, nothing happens. Then, 
too, the outer door doesn’t open 
until the steam has pushed the 
water out and then condensed — 
in other words, not till both pres- 
sure and temperature have 
dropped below a certain point. At 
the moment the outer door begins 
to open a relatively slight increase 
in internal pressure, as by water 
entry, will close it again.” 

Demerest said, “But once men 
have passed through the lock, the 
inner door closes behind them and 



seawater must be allowed into the 
lock again. Can you do that grad- 
ually against the full pressure of 
the ocean outside?” 

“No.” Bergen smiled. “It 
doesn’t pay to fight the ocean too 
hard. You have to roll with the 
punch. We slow it down to about 
one tenth of free entry but even so 
it comes in like a rifle shot — loud- 
er, a thunderclap — or waterclap, 
if you prefer. The inner door can 
hold it, though, and it is not sub- 
jected to the strain very often. 
You heard the waterclap when we 
first met — when Javan’s ’scaphe 
took off again. Remember?” 

“I remember,” said Demerest. 
“But here is something I don’t un- 
derstand. You keep the lock filled 
with ocean at high pressure at all 
times to keep the outer door with- 
out strain. But that keeps the in- 
ner door at full strain. Somewhere 
there has to be strain.” 

“Yes, indeed. But if the outer 
door, with a thousand-atmosphere 
differential on its two sides, breaks 
down, the full ocean in all its mil- 
lions of cubic miles tries to enter 
and that would be the end of all. 
If the inner door is the one under 
strain and it gives, then it will be 
messy indeed— but the only water 
that enters Ocean-Deep will be the 
limited quantity in the lock and its 
pressure will drop at once. We will 
have plenty of time for repair — 
the outer door will certainly hold a 
long time.” 

“But if both go at once?”

“We are through.” Brand 
shrugged. “I need not tell you 
that neither absolute certainty nor 
absolute safety exist. You have to 
live with some risk and the chance 
of double and simultaneous failure 
is so microscopically small that it 
can be lived with easily.” 

“If all your mechanical contri- 
vances fail — ” 

“They fail safe,” said Brand 
stubbornly. 



D EMEREST nodded. He fin- 
ished the last of his chicken. 
Mrs. Bergen was already begin- 
ning to clean up. 

“You’ll pardon my questions^ 
Mr. Bergen, I hope.” 

“You’re welcome to ask. I 
wasn’t informed, actually, as to 
the precise nature of your mission 
here. ‘Fact-finding’ is a weasel 
phrase. However, I assume there 
is keen distress on the Moon over 
the recent disaster and as safety 
engineer you rightly feel the re- 
sponsibility of correcting whatever 
shortcomings exist and would be 
interesting in learning, if possible, 
from the system used in Ocean- 
Deep.” 

“Exactly. But, see here, if all 
your automatic contrivances fail 
safe for some reason, for any rea- 
son, you would be alive but all 
your escape mechanisms would be 
sealed permanently shut. You 
would be trapped inside Ocean- 
Deep and would exchange a slow 



death for a fast one, that’s all.” 

“It’s not likely to happen but 
we’d hope we could make repairs 
before our air supply gave out. 
Besides we do have a manual 
backup system.” 

“Oh?” 

“Certainly. When Ocean-Deep 
was first established and this was 
the only unit — the one we’re sit- 
ting in now — manual controls 
were all we had. That was unsafe, 
if you like. There they are, right 
behind you — covered with friable 
plastic.” 

“In emergency, break glass,” 
muttered Demerest, inspecting the 
covered setup. 

“Pardon me?” 

“Just a phrase commonly used 
in ancient fire-fighting systems. 
Well, do the manuals still work or 
has the system been covered with 
your friable plastic for twenty 
years to the point where it has all 
decayed into uselessness with no 
one noticing.” 

“Not at all. It’s periodically 
checked — as all our equipment is. 
That’s not my job but I know it is 
done. If any electrical or electron- 
ic circuit is out of its normal work- 
ing condition, lights flash, signals 
sound, everything happens but a 
nuclear blast. You know, Mr. De- 
merest, we are as curious about 
Luna City as you are about 
Ocean-Deep. I presume you would 
be willing to invite one of our 
young men — ” 

“How about a young woman?”

interposed Annette at once. 

“I am sure you mean yourself, 
dear,” said Bergen. “And I can 
only answer that you are deter- 
mined to have a baby here and to 
keep it here for a period of time 
after birth — and that effectively 
eliminates you from considera- 
tion.” 

Demerest said stiffly, “We hope 
you will send men to Luna City. 
We are anxious to have you un- 
derstand our problems.” 

“Yes, a mutual exchange of 
problems and of weeping on each 
others’ shoulders might be of 
great comfort to all. For instance, 
you have one advantage on Luna 
City that I wish we could have. 
With low gravity and a low pres- 
sure-differential you can make 
your caverns take on any irregular 
and angular fashion that appeals 
to your esthetic sense or is re- 
quired for convenience. Down 
here we’re restricted to the sphere 
— at least for the foreseeable fu- 
ture — and our designers develop a 
hatred for the spherical that sur- 
passes belief. Actually it isn’t fun- 
ny. It breaks them down. They 
eventually resign rather than con- 
tinue to work spherically.” Bergen 
shook his head and leaned his 
chair back against a microfilm 
cabinet. “You know, when Wil- 
liam Beebe built the first deep-sea 
chamber in history in the nine- 
teen-thirties — it was just a gondo- 
la suspended from a mother ship 
by a half-mile cable. It had no 



buoyancy chambers and no en- 
gines — and if the cable broke, 
good night. Only it never did. 
Anyway, what was I saying? Oh, 
when Beebe built his first deep- 
sea chamber he was going to make 
it cylindrical; you know, so a man 
would fit in it comfortably. After 
all, a man is essentially a tall, 
skinny cylinder. However, a friend 
of his argued him out of that and 
into a sphere on the very sensible 
grounds that a sphere would re- 
sist pressure more efficiently than 
any other possible shape.” 

Demerest considered that brief- 
ly but made no comment. He re- 
turned to the earlier topic. 

“We would particularly like 
someone from Ocean-Deep,” he 
said, “to visit Luna City because 
it might lead to a great enough 
understanding of the need, on 
Ocean-Deep’s part for a course of 
action that might involve consid- 
erable self-sacrifice.” 

“Oh?” Bergen’s chair came 
down on all four legs. “How’s 
that?” 

“Ocean-Deep is a marvelous 
achievement — I wish to detract 
nothing from that. I can see where 
it will become greater still, a won- 
der of the world. Still—” 

“Still?” 

“Still the oceans are only a part 
of the Earth — a major part but 
only a part. The deep sea is only 
part of the ocean. It is inner space 
indeed — it works inward, narrow- 
ing constantly to a point.”

“I think,” broke in Annette, 
looking rather grim, “that you’re 
about to make a comparison with 
Luna City.” 

I NDEED. I am,” said Demer- 
est. “Luna City represents out- 
er space, widening to infinity. 
There is nowhere to go down here 
in the long run — everywhere to go 
out there.” 

“We don’t judge by size and 
volume alone, Mr. Demerest,” 
said Bergen. “The ocean is only a 
small part of Earth, true, but for 
that very reason it is intimately 
connected with over five billion 
human beings. Ocean-Deep is ex- 
perimental but the settlements on 
the Continental Shelf already de- 
serve the name of cities. Ocean- 
Deep offers mankind the chance 
of exploiting the whole planet — ” 
“Of polluting the whole plan- 
et,” broke in Demerest, excitedly. 
“Of raping it, of ending it. The 
concentration of human effort to 
Earth itself is unhealthy and even 
fatal if it isn’t balanced by a turn- 
ing outward to the frontier.” 

“There is nothing at the fron- 
tier,” said Annette, snapping out 
the words. “The Moon is dead. 
All the other worlds out there are 
dead. If there are live worlds 
among the stars, light-years away, 
they can’t be reached. The ocean 
is living.” 

“The Moon is living, too, Mrs. 
Bergen. And if Ocean-Deep al- 
lows it, the Moon will become an 



independent world. We Moonmen 
will then see to it that other worlds 
''are reached and made alive and, 
if mankind has the patience, we 
will reach the stars. We! We! It is 
only Moonmen, used to space, 
used to a world in a cavern, used 
to an engineered environment who 
could endure life in a spaceship 
that may have to travel centuries 
to reach the stars.” 

“Wait, wait, Demerest,” said 
Bergen, holding up his hand, 
“Back up. What you do mean — if 
Ocean-Deep allows it? What have 
we to do with it?” 

“You’re competing with us, Mr. 
Bergen. The Planetary Project 
Commission will swing your way, 
give you more, give us less, be- 
cause in the short term, as your 
wife says, the ocean is alive and 
the Moon, except for a thousand 
men, is not— because you are a 
half-dozen miles away and we a 
quarter of a million — because you 
can be reached in an hour and we 
only in three days. And because 
you have an ideal safety record 
and we have had — misfortunes.” 

“The last, surely, is trivial. Ac- 
cidents can happen at any time, 
anywhere.” 

“But the trivial can be used,” 
said Demerest angrily. “It can be 
made to manipulate emotions. To 
people who don’t see the purpose 
and the importance of space ex- 
ploration the death of Moonmen 
in accidents is proof enough that 
the Moon is dangerous, that its 



24 



IF 




colonization is a useless fantasy. 
Why not? It’s their excuse for sav- 
ing money and they can then salve 
their conscience by investing part 
of it in Ocean-Deep instead. 
That’s why I said the accident on 
the Moon had threatened the sur- 
vival of Luna City even though it 
killed only twenty people out of 
nearly a thousand.” 

“I don’t accept your argument. 
There has been enough money for 
both for a score of years.” 

“Not enough money. That’s ex- 
actly it. Not enough to make the 
Moon self-supporting in all these 
years — and then they use that 
lack of self-support against us. 
Not enough to make Ocean-Deep 
self-supporting either — but now 
they can give you enough if they 
cut us out altogether.” 

“Do you think that will hap- 
pen?” 

“I’m almost sure it will — unless 
Ocean-Deep shows a statesman- 
like concern for man’s future.” 
“How?” 

“By refusing to accept addition- 
al funds. By not competing with 
Luna City. By putting the good of 
the whole race ahead of self-inter- 
est.” 

“Surely you don’t expect us to 
dismantle — ” 

“You won’t have to. Don’t you 
see? Join us in explaining that Lu- 
na City is essential, that space ex- 
ploration is the hope of mankind 
— that you will wait, retrench if 
necessary.” 



Bergen looked at his wife and 
raised his eyebrows. She shook her 
head angrily. 

Bergen said, “You have a rath- 
er romantic view of the PPC, I 
think. Even if I made noble, self- 
sacrificing speeches, who’s to say 
they would listen. There’s a great 
deal more involved in the matter 
of Ocean-Deep than my opinion 
and my statements. There are eco- 
nomic considerations and public 
feeling. Why don’t you relax, Mr. 
Demerest? Luna City won’t come 
to an end. You’ll receive funds. 
I’m sure of it. I tell you I’m sure 
of it. Now let’s break this up—” 
“No, I’ve got to convince you 
one way or another that I’m seri- 
ous. If necessary, Ocean-Deep 
must come to a halt unless the 
PPC can supply ample funds for 
both.” 

Bergen ^aid, “Is this some sort 
of official mission, Mr. Demerest? 
Are you speaking for Luna City 
officially or just for yourself?” 
“Just for myself — but maybe 
that’s enough, Mr. Bergen,” said 
Demerest. 

“I don’t think it is. I’m -sorry, 
but this is turning out to be un- 
pleasant. I suggest that after all 
you had better return topside on 
the first available ’scaphe.” 

“Not yet! Not yet!” Demerest 
looked about wildly, then rose un- 
steadily and put his back against 
the wall. He was a little too tall 
for the room and he became con- 
scious of life receding. One more 



WATERCLAP 



25 




step and he would have gone too 
far to back out. 



IV 

H E HAD told them back on 
the Moon that there would be 
no use talking, no use negotiating. 
It was dog-eat-dog for the avail- 
able funds and Luna City’s desti- 
ny must not be aborted— not for 
Ocean-Deep, not for Earth — no, 
not for all of Earth, since mankind 
and the Universe came even be- 
fore the Earth. Man must out- 
grow his womb. 

Demerest could hear his own 
ragged breathing and the inner 
turmoil of his whirling thoughts. 
The other two were looking at him 
with what seemed concern. 

Annette rose and said, “Are 
you ill, Mr. Demerest?” 

“I am not ill. Sit down. I’m a 
safety engineer and I want to 
teach you about safety. Sit down, 
Mrs. Bergen.” 

“Sit down, Annette,” said Ber- 
gen. “I’ll take care of him.” 

He rose and took a step for- 
ward. 

But Demerest said, “No. Don’t 
you move either. I have some- 
thing right here. You’re too naive 
concerning human dangers, Mr. 
Bergen. You guard against the sea 
and against mechanical failure 
and you don’t search your humdn 
visitors, do you? I have a weapon, 
Bergen.” 

Now that it was out and he had 



27 



taken the final step from which 
there was no returning — for he 
was now dead, whatever he did — 
he was quite calm. 

Annette said, “Oh, John,” and 
grasped her husband’s arm. 

Bergen stepped in front of her. 

“A weapon? Is that what that 
thing is? Now slowly, Demerest, 
slowly. There’s nothing to get hot 
over. If you want to talk we’ll talk. 
What is that?’’ 

“Nothing dramatic. A portable 
laser beam.’’ 

“But what do you want to do 
with it?’’ 

“Destroy Ocean-Deep.’’ 

“But you can’t, Demerest. You 
know you can’t. You can pack 
only so much energy into your 
fist and any laser you can hold 
can’t pump enough heat to pene- 
trate the walls.’’ 

“I know that. TJiis packs more 
kick than you think. It’s Moon- 
made and there are some advan- 
tages to manufacturing an energy 
unit in a vacuum — but you’re 
right. Even so it’s designed only 
for small jobs and requires fre- 
quent recharging. So I don’t in- 
tend to try to cut through a foot- 
plus of alloy steel. But it will do 
the job indirectly. For one thing it 
will keep you two quiet. There’s 
enough energy in my fist to kill 
two people.’’ 

“You wouldn’t kill us,’’ said 
Bergen evenly. “You have no rea- 
son.’’ 

“If by that,’’ said Demerest, 



“you imply that I am an unrea- 
soning being to be somehow made 
to understand my madness, forget 
it. I have every reason to kill you 
and I will kill you. By laser beam 
if I have to, though I would rath- 
er not.’’ 

“What good will killing us do 
you? Make me understand. Is it 
that I have refused to sacrifice 
Ocean-Deep funds? I couldn’t do 
anything else. I’m not really the 
one to make the decision. And 
your killing me won’t help force 
the decision in your direction, will 
it? In fact, quite the contrary. If a 
Moonman is a murderer, how will 
that reflect on Luna City? Con- 
sider human emotions on Earth.’’ 
An edge of shrillness was in An- 
nette’s voice as she joined in: 
“don’t you see there will be peo- 
ple who will say that solar radia- 
tion on the Moon has dangerous 
effects? That the genetic engineer- 
ing which has reorganized your 
bones and muscles has affected 
mental stability? Consider the 
word ‘lunatic,’ Mr. Demerest. 
Men once believed the Moon 
brought madness.’’ 

“I am not mad, Mrs. Bergen.’’ 
“It doesn’t matter,’’ said Ber- 
gen, following his wife’s lead 
smoothly. “Men will say that you 
were — that all Moonmen are — 
and Luna City will be closed down 
and the Moon itself closed to all 
further exploration, perhaps for- 
ever. Is that what you want?’’ 

“That might happen if they 



28 



IF 




thought I killed you — but they 
won’t. It will be an accident.” 

With his left elbow, Demerest 
broke the plastic that covered the 
manual controls. 

“I know units of this sort,” he 
said. “I know exactly how they 
work. Logically, breaking that 
plastic should set up a warning 
flash — after all, it might be brok- 
en by accident — and then some- 
one would be here to investigate 
or, better yet, the controls should 
lock until deliberately released to 
make sure the break was not 
merely accidental.” He paused, 
then said, “But I’m sure no one 
will come, that no warning has 
taken place. Your manual system 
is not fail safe because in your 
heart you were sure it would never 
be used.” 

“What do you plan to do?” said 
Bergen. 

H E WAS tense and Demerest 
watched his knees carefully. 
He said, “If you try to jump to- 
ward me I’ll shoot at once — and 
then keep right on with what I’m 
doing.” 

“I think maybe you’re giving 
me nothing to lose.” 

“You’ll lose time. Let me go 
right on without interference and 
you’ll have some minutes to keep 
on talking. You may even be able 
to talk me out of it. There’s my 
proposal. Don’t interfere with me 
and I will give you your chance to 
argue.” 



“But what do you plan to do?” 
“This,” said Demerest. He did 
not have to look. His left hand 
snaked out and closed a contact. 
“The fusion unit will now pump 
heat into the airlock and the steam 
will empty it. It will take a few 
minutes. When it’s done, I’m sure 
one of those little red-glass but- 
tons will light.” 

“Are you going to—” 

Demerest said, “Why do you 
ask? You know that I must be in- 
tending, having gone this far, to 
flood Ocean-Deep?” 

“But why? Damn it, why?” 
“Because U will be marked 
down as an accident. Because your 
safety record will be spoiled. Be- 
cause it will be a complete catas- 
trophe and will wipe you out. The 
PPC will then turn from you and 
the glamor of Ocean-Deep will be 
gone. We will get the funds. We 
will continue. If I could bring this 
to pass in some other way I would 
— but the needs of Luna City are 
the needs of mankind and those 
are paramount.” 

“You will die, too,” Annette 
managed to say. 

“Of course. Once I am forced to 
do something like this — woulcM 
want to live? I’m not a murderer.” 
“But you will be. If you flood 
this unit you will flood all of 
Ocean Deep and kill everyone in 
it — and doom those who are out 
in their subs to slower death. Fifty 
men- and women — an unborn 
child—”

“That is not my fault,” said 
Demerest, in clear pain. “I did not 
expect to find a pregnant woman 
here but now that I have — I can’t 
stop because of it.” 

“But you must stop,” said Ber- 
gen. “You plan won’t work unless 
what happens can be shown to be 
an accident. They’ll find you with 
a beamemitter in your hand and 
with the manual controls clearly 
tampered with. Do you think they 
won’t deduce the truth?” 

Demerest was feeling very tired. 

“Mr. Bergen, you sound des- 
perate. Listen — when the outer 
door opens, water under a thou- 
sand atmospheres of pressure will 
enter. It will be a massive batter- 
ing ram that will destroy and 
mangle everything in its path. The 
walls of the Ocean-Deep units will 
remain but everything inside will 
be twisted beyond recognition. 
Human beings will be mangled in- 
to shredded tissue and splintered 
bone and death will be instantane- 
ous and unfelt. Even if I were to 
burn you to death with the laser 
there’d be nothing left to show it 
had been done, so I won’t hesi- 
tate, you see. This manual unit 
will be smashed anyway — any- 
thing I can do will be erased by 
the water.” 

“But the beam-emitter; the la- 
ser gun. Even damaged, it will be 
recognizable,” said Annette. 

“We use such things on the 
Moon, Mrs. Bergen. It is a com- 
mon tool; it is the optical analog 



of a jackknife. I could kill you 
with a jackknife, you know, but 
one would not deduce that a man 
carrying a jackknife — or even 
holding one with the blade open — 
was necessarily planning murder. 
He might be whittling. Besides, a 
Moon-made laser is not a projec- 
tile gun. It doesn’t have to with- 
stand an internal explosion. It is 
made of thin metal, mechanically 
weak. After it is smashed by the 
waterclap I doubt that it will make 
much sense as an object.” 

Demerest did not have to think 
to make these statements. He had 
worked them out within himself 
through months of self-debate. 

“In fact,” he went on, “how 
will the investigators ever know 
what happened in here? They will 
send ’scaphes down to inspect 
what is left of Ocean-Deep but 
how can they get inside without 
first pumping out the water. They 
will, in effect, have to build a new 
Ocean-Deep and that would take 
— how long? Perhaps, given pub- 
lic reluctance to throw good mon- 
ey after bad, they might never do 
it at all and content themselves 
with dropping a laurel wreath on 
the dead walls of the d«ad Ocean- 
Deep.” 

Bergen said, “The men on Luna 
City will know what you have 
done. Surely one of them will have 
a conscience. The truth will be 
known.” 

“One truth,” said Demerest, “is 
that I am not a fool. No one on 



30 



IF 




Luna City knows what I planned 
to do or will suspect what I have 
done. They sent me down here to 
negotiate cooperation on the mat- 
ter of financial grants. I was to ar- 
gue and nothing more. There’s not 
even a laser beam-emitter missing 
up there. I put this one together 
myself out of scrapped parts. And 
it works. I’ve tested it.” 

Annette said slowly, “You 
haven’t thought it through. Do 
you know what you’re doing?” 

“I’ve thought it through. I 
know what I’m doing. And I 
know also that you are both con- 
scious of the lit signal. I’m aware 
of it. The airlock is empty and 
time’s up, I’m afraid.” 

Rapidly, holding his weapon 
tensely high, he closed another 
contact. A circular part of the 
unit wall cracked into a thin cres- 
cent and rolled smoothly away. 

O UT of the corner of his eye 
Demerest saw the gaping 
darkness, but he did not look. A 
dank salt vapor issued from it — a 
queer odor of dead steam. He 
even imagined he could hear the 
flopping sound of the gathered 
water at the bottom of the lock. 

He said, “The outer door ought 
to be frozen shut now if the man- 
ual unit had been rationally de- 
signed. With the inner door open, 
nothing ought to make the outer 
door budge. I suspect, though, 
that the manuals were put togeth- 
er too quickly at first for proper 



precautions to have been taken. 
And if I need further evidence 
that I’m guessing correctly you 
wouldn’t be sitting there so tense- 
ly. The outer door will open. I 
need to touch one more contact 
and the waterclap will come. We 
will feel nothing.” 

Annette said, “Don’t push it 
just yet. I have one more thing to 
say. You said we would have time 
to persuade you.” 

“While the water was being 
pushed out.” 

“Just let me say this. A minute. 
A minute. I said you didn’t know 
what you were doing. You don’t. 
You’re destroying the space pro- 
gram, the space program. There’s 
more to space than space.” 

Her voice had grown shrill. 

“What are you talking about? 
Make sense or I’ll end it all. I’m 
tired. I’m frightened. I want it 
over.” 

Annette said, “You’re not in 
the inner councils of the PPC. 
Neither is my husband. But I am. 
Do you think because I am a 
woman that I’m secondary here. 
I’m not. You, Mr. Demerest, have 
your eyes fixed on Luna City only. 
My husband has his fixed on 
Ocean-Deep. Neither of you know 
anything. Where do you expect to 
go, Mr. Demerest, if you had all 
the money you wanted? Mars? 
The asteroids? The satellites of the 
gas giants? These are all small 
worlds — all dry surfaces under a 
blank sky. It may be generations 



WATERCLAP 



31 




before we are ready to try for the 
stars and till then we’d have only 
pygmy real estate. Is that your 
ambition? My husband’s is no 
better. He dreams of pushing 
man’s habitat over the ocean 
floor, a surface not much larger in 
the last analysis than the surface 
of the Moon and the other pygmy 
worlds. We of the PPC, on the 
other hand, want more than either 
of you — and if you push that but- 
ton, mankind’s greatest dream will 
come to nothing.” 

Demerest found himself inter- 
ested despite himself but he said, 
“You’re just babbling.” 

It was possible, he knew v that 
somehow they had warned others 
in Ocean-Deep, that any moment 
someone would come to interrupt, 
someone would try to shoot him 
down. He was, however, staring at 
the only opening and he had only 
to close one contact without even 
looking — a second’s movement. 

Annette said, “I’m not babbl- 
ing. You know it took more than 
rocket ships to colonize the Moon. 
To make a successful colony pos- 
sible men had to be altered geneti- 
cally and adjusted to low-gravity. 
You are a product of such genetic 
engineering.” 

“Well?” 

“And might not genetic engi- 
neering also help adjust men to 
greater gravitational pull? What is 
the largest solar planet?” 

“Jupiter.” 

“Yes, Jupiter. Eleven times the 



diameter of the Earth — forty times 
the diameter of the 'Moon. A sur- 
face a hundred and twenty times 
that of the Earth in area— sixteen 
hundred times that of the Moon. 
Conditions so different from any- 
thing we can encounter anywhere 
on the worlds the size of Earth or 
less that any scientist of any per- 
suasion would give half his life to 
observe them at close range.” 

“But Jupiter is an impossible^ 
target.” 

“Indeed?” said Annette and 
even managed a faint smile. “As 
impossible as the Moon? As im- 
possible as flying? Why is it im- 
possible? Genetic engineering 
could design men with stronger 
and denser bones, stronger and 
more compact muscles. The same 
principles that enclose Luna City 
against the vacuum and Ocean- 
Deep- against the sea can also en- 
close the future Jupiter-Deep 
against its ammoniated surround- 
ings.” 

“The gravitational field — ” 

“Can be negotiated by nuclear 
ships now on the drawing board. 
You don’t know that but I do.” 

“We’re not even sure about the 
depth of the atmosphere. The 
pressures — ” 

“The pressures! Mr. Demerest, 
look about you. Why do you sup- 
pose Ocean-Deep was really built? 
To exploit the ocean? The settle- 
ments on the Continental Shelf 
are doing that quite adequately. 
To gain knowledge of the deep- 



32 



IF 




sea bottom? We could do that by 
’scaphe easily and we could then 
have spared the hundred billion 
dollars invested in Ocean-Deep. 

“Don’t you see, Mr. Demerest, 
that Ocean-Deep must mean 
something more than that? The 
purpose of Ocean-Deep is to de- 
vise the ultimate vessels and 
mechanisms that will explore and 
colonize Jupiter. Look about you 
and see the beginnings of a Jovian 
environment — the closest ap- 
proach to it we can achieve on 
Earth. It is only a faint image — 
but it’s a beginning. Destroy this, 
Mr. Demerest, and you destroy 
any hope foF Jupiter. On the oth- 
er hand, let us live and we will, 
together, penetrate and settle the 
brightest jewel of the solar system. 
And long before we can reach the 
limits of Jupiter we’ll be ready for 
the stars, for the Earth-type plan- 
ets circling them — and the Jupi- 
ter-type planets, too. Luna City 
won’t be abandoned because both 
are necessary for this ultimate 
aim.” 

For the moment Demerest had 
altogether forgotten about that 
last button. 

He said, “Nobody on Luna City 
has heard of this.” 

“You haven’t. There are those 
on Luna City who know. If you 
had told them of your plan of de- 
struction they would have stopped 
you. Naturally, we can’t make 
this common knowledge and only 
a few people anywhere can know. 



The public supports only with dif- 
ficulty the planetary projects now 
in progress. If the PPC is parsi- 
monious it is because public opin- 
ion limits its generosity. What do 
you suppose public opinion would 
say if they thought we were aim- 
ing toward Jupiter? What a super- 
boondoggle that would be in their 
eyes. But we continue and what 
money we can save and make use 
of we place in the various facets of 
Project Big World.” 

“Project Big World?” 

“Yes,” said Annette. “You 
know now and I have committed 
a serious security breach. But it 
doesn’t matter, does it? Since 
we’re all dead and since the pro- 
ject is, too.” 

“Wait now, Mrs. Bergen.” 

“If you change your mind now 
— don’t think you can ever talk 
about Project Big World. That 
would end the project just as ef- 
fectively as destruction here 
would. And it would end both 
your career and mine. It might 
end Luna City and Ocean-Deep, 
too — so now that you know, may- 
be it makes no difference anyway. 
You might just as well push that 
button.” 

Demerest’s brow was furrowed 
and his eyes burned with anguish. 
“I don’t know — ” 

Bergen gathered for the sudden 
jump as Demerest’s tense alert- 
ness wavered into uncertain in- 
trospection but Annette grasped 
her husband’s sleeve. 



WATERCLAP

A timeless interval that might 
have been ten seconds long fol- 
lowed and then Demerest held out 
his laser. 

“Take it,” he said. “I’ll consid- 
er myself under arrest.” 

“You can’t be arrested,” said 
Annette, “without the whole story 
coming out.” She took the laser 
and gave it to Bergen. “It will be 
enough that you return to Luna 
City and keep silent. Till then we 
will keep you under guard.” 

Bergen was at the manual con- 
trols. The inner door slid shut and 
after that came the thunderous 
waterclap of the water returning 
into the lock. 

H USBAND and wife were 
alone again. They had not 
dared to say a word until Demer- 
est was safely put to sleep under 
the watchful eyes of two men de- 
tailed for the purpose. The unex- 
pected waterclap had aroused ev- 
erybody and a sharply bowdler- 
ized account of the incident had 
been given out. 

The manual controls were now 
locked off and Bergen said, “From 
this moment on the manuals will 
have to be adjusted to fail safe. 
Visitors will have to be searched.” 
“Oh, John,” said Annette. “I 
think people are insane. There we 
were, facing death for us and for 
Ocean-Deep, just the end of ev- 
erything. And I kept thinking — I 
must keep calm, I mustn’t have a 
miscarriage.” 



“You kept calm all right. You 
were magnificent. I mean, Project 
Big Planet! I never conceived of 
such a thing but, by Jove, it’s an 
attractive thought. Wonderful!” 
“I’m sorry I had to say all that, 
John. It was all a fake, of course. 
I made it up. Demerest wanted 
me to make something up, really. 
He wasn’t a killer or destroyer — 
he was, according to his own over- 
heated lights, a patriot. And I 
suppose he was telling himself he 
must destroy in order to save — a 
common enough view among the 
small-minded. But he said he 
would give us time to talk him out 
of it and I think he was praying 
we would manage to do so. He 
wanted us to think of something 
that would give him the excuse 
and I gave it to him. I’m sorry I 
had to fool you, John.” 

“You didn’t fool me.” 

“I didn’t?” 

“How could you? I knew you 
weren’t a member of PPC.” 

“What made you so sure of 
that? Because I’m a woman?” 

“Not at all. Because I’m a 
member, Annette, and that’s con- 
fidential. And, if you don’t mind, 
I will begin a move to initiate ex- 
actly what you suggested — Project 
Big World.” 

“Well!” Annette considered 
that and, slowly, smiled. “Well! 
Women do have their uses.” 
“Something,” said Bergen, 
smiling also, “I have never de- 
nied.” •

IF 





TO TOUCH A STAR 

ROBERT F. YOUNG 

The blue star was an anti-paradox 
manifestation . Powers, falling 
helplessly into it, was a paradox 



35 



1. ChiMuZeta was discovered in 
ancient times, possibly as early as 
4000 A.D. However, its discover- 
ers knew only its initial properties 
mnd doubtless this was why they 
classified as radiation and nick- 
named “saltpeter" a force that 
transcends both space and time 
and supervises the consistency of 
the history of man . 

T HE spaceship Powers had 
stolen in his bid to regain his 
manhood was one of the new su- 
perfreighters the Company had re- 
cently put into use. Powers was no 
stranger to sophisticated ships but 
this one was not merely sophisti- 
cated — it was ultra-sophisticated. 
It did his laundry, prepared his 
meals and made his bed. It 
thought up games for the two of 
them to play and told him stories 
to amuse him. It kept him com- 
pany when he was lonely and sang 
Brahms’ Lullaby to him when he 
couldn’t sleep. It was all things to 
him — mentor, servant, maid, 
slave. The only function it 
couldn’t perform was that of mis- 
tress. But Powers had no need of 
a mistress. That was why he was 
journeying to the Blue Star. 

The ship’s name was M.A.R.Y. 
M for Morning Mist 
A for Afterglow 
R for Reawakening 
Y for Yearning. 

These were the planets it had 
been commissioned to serve; this 



was how freighters derived their 
names. 

The Blue Star had no name — 
only a catalog number: X-10-D. 
But catalog numbers frequently 
become names and this had hap- 
pened in the case of the Blue Star. 
Over the years X-10-D had trans- 
muted to Extend. 

Centered in the viewscreen of 
the Mary , it brought to mind a 
bright blue diamond lying in a jew- 
eler’s showcase. There are other 
diamonds in the showcase — red 
ones, yellow, green, orange — but 
these were relatively insignificant 
in the Blue Star’s presence: mere 
grains of cosmic dust the cosmic 
jeweler had forgotten to flick 
from his cosmic show-cushion. 

Powers, who had begun life as 
a foundling and who had once 
been an hermaphrodite, had been 
staring at the star for some time. 
Now he turned his eyes away to 
rest them. But the Blue Star went 
right on burning on his retina al- 
most as intensely as it burned in 
his brain. 

He bent over the star map he 
had come into the chart room to 
study. If he succeeded in regain- 
ing his virility he would need a far- 
away place to expend it— prefer- 
ably one on the other side of the 
galaxy from both Crag and Sub- 
lime. Crag was the home of the 
penal colony in which he had 
abided for four years and Sublime 
was the home of the Institute for 
Sublime Learning — more com- 



36 



IF 




monly known as “Salt Peter’s 
Cathedral” — where he had been 
impotentialized. 

He had a second reason for 
studying the map. TJie Beta Tau 
Storms. He knew that only the 
ship could see him safely through 
them but he wanted to know 
where they were. 

A S HE sat staring at the little 
purple spirals that denoted 
their general whereabouts, the 
door of the chart room opened 
and the “stewardess” came in. 
Powers didn’t want to look at her 
but he did anyway. The ship was 
some forty hours out from Twi- 
light, the Company-owned planet 
where he had stolen it, yet he still 
wasn’t wholly accustomed to this 
compelling combination of pos- 
tures, attitudes, charm, compan- 
ionableness, erudition and femi- 
ninity electronically transformed 
into a comely girl. 

He watched her as she walked 
toward him across the room, 
looked at her hungrily as she 
paused beside him. Faint golden 
fuzz grew upon her rounded 
forearms; her perfume made him 
think of terrestrial fields of but- 
tercups and clover. The curve of 
her chin made his heart ache. 

Her name was the ship’s name 
— Mary. 

She said, “Have you charted 
the storms to your satisfaction, 
Ben?” 

“I’m afraid only you can see us 



safely through the storms,” Pow- 
ers said. 

She smiled. “I’ll do my best.” 

He felt the material of her blue 
blouse touch his cheek as she ti- 
died up the chart table. This was 
not wholly illusion. A projection 
she might be— an electronically 
brewed personification of the ship 
— but she had a substance of sorts. 
Without it she would not have 
been able to do his laundry, pre- 
pare his meals and make his bed. 
And her reality went even deeper, 
for the ganglions of supership- 
computers were duplicates of the 
human brain. 

She said suddenly, “Are we fol- 
lowing an orthodox course to 
Morning Mist, Ben?” 

Caught off guard. Powers 
played for time. 

“Does it seem unorthodox?” 
She laughed. “I pay little at- 
tention to such matters. The pilot 
programs me and I obey.” She 
paused. Then: “But I am curious 
to know why you only partially 
programed me. As matters stand 
we shall proceed to Extend and 
make precisely two orbits around 
it at a mean altitude of 
14,021,636.2 miles. Then what?” 
“Then,” said Powers, seeing his 
way clear, “I will reprogram you, 
correcting the error I made in my 
original programing and putting 
us on an orthodox course to 
Morning Mist.” 

She said, “Oh, I see.” And 
then: “I thought of a different 



TO TOUCH A STAR 



37 




game for us to play tonight, Ben. 
It’s an awfully old one, but it’s 
lots of fun. It’s called checkers.” 
Powers had never heard of it. 
But playing it might get the Blue 
Star off his mind. 

“I’ll look forward to it,” he 
said. 

“Fine. See you at supper.” 

A FTER she left the room Pow- 
ers got up and stepped over 
to the drink dispenser. He dialed 
a cold daiquiri and drank it slow- 
ly. I wonder what I’d do, he 
thought, if she were a real wom- 
an. 

The answer, of course, was — 
nothing. 

When they impotentialized you 
they burned a little ditty into your 
brain for you to think of and hum 
the music to when doubts assailed 
you. It went like this: 

Impotent I may be 
But I will see 
Stars lovers know as dust 
In the blindness of their lust . 
He hummed the tune now, think- 
ing the words. 

And the words danced in his 
mind — twisted, turned, attenu- 
ated, took on flesh and shaped 
themselves into naked nymphs 
and the nymphs cavorted licen- 
tiously around a grotesque Pan 
— and the Pan was himself, 
hooves rooted in the ground, 
straining straining to be free, the 
while idiotically playing the impo- 
tentialization tune upon a syrinx. 



The techs at Salt Peter’s Cathe- 
dral hadn’t known that he had 
once been an hermaphrodite and 
he hadn’t told them. He kept that 
part of his life a deep dark secret. 
But he should have told them. 
Maybe they would have known 
what Powers had subsequently 
found out — that ex-hermaphro- 
dites have a partial immunity to 
ChiMuZeta — and would have ex- 
posed him for a longer period of 
time. As it was they had taken 
away just enough of his manhood 
to make it impossible for him to 
have a woman and left just enough 
of it for him to want one. 

I RONICALLY, Powers had 
been serving a life sentence for 
multiple rape when the penal col- 
ony officials had put the proposi- 
tion to him. However, it was a 
crime he was not guilty of — could 
not possibly have been guilty of 
for the simple reason that he had 
not been on the scene when it had 
been committed. The proposition 
the penal colony officials put to 
him was as follows: if he would 
submit to impotentialization and 
accept a lifetime job as a long-run 
pilot for Stellar Carriers, Inc., he 
would be given his freedom. The 
reason long-run pilots were impo- 
tentialized was that the runs some- 
times lasted as long as four years 
and a man who did not want a 
woman could live alone for longer 
periods of time than one who did. 
The proposition was a standard 



38 



IF 




one and had been put to innumer- 
able lifers before Powers — this 
was the only way the carriers 
could obtain long-run pilots. 
None of the lifers had refused. 
Powers hadn’t refused either. A 
little bit of freedom was better 
than none. 

He had been sent directly to 
Sublime. There the techs at Salt 
Peter’s Cathedral had briefed him 
on ChiMuZeta in accordance 
with the law and had given him the 
Treatment. It had required exact- 
ly one long run — a relatively 
short one — for Powers to discov- 
er that the Treatment hadn’t tak- 
en. At first, naturally enough, he 
had assumed that it had had no 
effect upon him at all and he had 
rejoiced in the thought that he 
had cheated both the penal colony 
and the Company. Thdn, in a mir- 
rored room in an orbital brothel 
off Twilight he had discovered 
that he had cheated no one except 
himself. 

2. At first the ancients knew only 
that ChiMuZeta came from the 
star X-IO-D, that exposure to it 
for the duration of a single orbit 
at a mean altitude of 14,021,636.2 
miles (or the' equivalent thereof ) 
resulted in impotence and that 
exposure for the duration of two 
orbits at the same mean altitude 
(or the equivalent thereof ) re- 
sulted in restoration of virility. 
They would not even have known 
this much had not one of them. 



apparently by accident, made an 
orbit at this altitude and had not 
another of them, years later under 
a galactic government grant and 
in company with a female of the 
species, made two . 

S UPPER was at seven. Mary 
served it. 

As was her custom, she sat 
across the table from him and kept 
him company while he ate. To- 
night she had served roast leg of 
lamb, baked sweet potato, diced 
carrots, mint jelly and hot but- 
tered rolls — all synthetics, of 
course, but extremely tasty. 

Powers asked for a second help- 
ing of mint jelly and Mary, clear- 
ly pleased, spooned him out a gen- 
erous one. He enjoyed the meal 
immensely, as he did all her meals. 
They were a far cry from the fare 
he’d been accustomed to on Crag 
and an even farther one from the 
fare he’d known in the Our Moth- 
er of Moses Orphanage on Sinai 
where he’d spent the first sixteen 
years of his life. The Our Mother 
of Moses Orphanage, though, 
hadn’t been responsible for its 
meager fare. Sinai was a barren 
planet and had to import all its 
foodstuffs, and practical consid- 
erations, such as money, posed 
severe limitations on what could 
be imported. 

But while Powers couldn’t 
blame Our Mother of Moses for 
the skimpiness of her meals, he 
could— and did— blame her for 



TO TOUCH A STAR 



39 




abysmal ignorance he had been 
kept in during the early part of his 
life. It wasn’t till after he left the 
place behind him and worked his 
way to Lebanon on a food frieght- 
er that he found out what was 
wrong with him. Fortunately 
Lebanon, even in those days, had 
been an enlightened’ planet and 
he’d had no trouble getting the 
wrongness set right. 

“Come on,’’ Mary said, sweep- 
ing the remnants of the meal into 
the dissolver. “Let’s play check- 
ers.’’ 

He followed her out of the little 
galley and down the corridor to 
the lounge. The lounge was small 
and compact, and contained 
among other things a little round 
table with two chairs. A checker- 
board l^y on the table, a stack of 
red checkers on one side of it and 
a stack of black ones on the other. 

They sat down. Mary placed the 
checkers on their proper squares 
and explained the rules of the 
game to him. Powers made the 
first move. 

She won the first game— he, the 
second. He knew, of course, that 
she had let him win. But he caught 
on swiftly, began to plan three, 
sometimes four moves ahead. 
Mary of course could plan any 
number of moves ahead but this 
posed a challenge and served to 
make the game all the more intri- 
guing. 

For some reason his mind was 
unusually keen tonight. As he 



continued to play it grew keener 
yet and he found himself looking 
six moves ahead. Nine. Finally, 
when they stood at ten games 
apiece, the following pattern ap- 
peared upon the board. All of the 
men were kinged, and it was Pow- 
ers’ turn: 




The sharpness of Powers’ mind 
was now such that he could see 
simultaneously every possible 
move he could make, every possi- 
ble move Mary could make, the 
subsequent patterns that would 
emerge and the new sets of possi- 
ble moves that went with them. 
Thus, he saw not only the pattern 
itself, but all of its potential rami- 
fications. 

The overall pattern was fasci- 
nating in its complexity. He stared 
at it intently, studying its intricate 
lines and angles. The original pat- 
tern was no longer distinguish- 
able: fact and extrapolation had 
become one. He found presently 
that he could no longer tell which 
of the lines represented his po- 
tential moves and which Mary’s. 
But that was all right; it was the 
pattern that counted — not its in- 
dividual parts. 

H E RAISED his eyes to 
Mary’s face, intending to tell 



40 



IF 




her about the fascinating pattern 
— but he saw that she already 
knew about it. She had stood up, 
he noticed, and was gesturing for 
him to do the same. He obeyed. 
It seemed only natural that he 
should. Now she was leaving the 
lounge, looking back at him over 
her shoulder. Follow me, her 
eyes said. He did so. 

Along the corridor to the com- 
panionway. Down the companion- 
way to the lower deck. Across the 
lower deck to the lifts. 

“Follow me,” Mary said. “Yes, 
I’ll follow you,” he said. “I’ll fol- 
low wherever you go.” 

He followed her into Lift-A, 
dropped down with her to the 
deck-level of Hold-A. Here, locks 
confronted them. Atmosphere 
was never maintained in the holds 
of freighters unless the goods be- 
ing transported required it and 
the holds of the Mary were emp- 
ty. 

The first note of wrongness 
struck Powers when Mary began 
turning the deactivator on the in- 
ner lock. Shouldn’t he be suited? 

He asked her. 

She did not answer but went on 
turning the activator. 

The inner lock swung open. 

She stepped into the intra-lock 
compartment. He almost fol- 
lowed. The pattern was less clear 
in his mind now. Its lines were 
wavering, running together. 

What was he doing in the hold- 
area? 



“Mary, why have we come 
here?” he asked. 

She did not answer. She was 
busy turning a dial on the inner 
wall. He knew the function of the 
dial. It controlled the mechanism 
that closed the inner lock and then 
opened the outer one. Whoosh! 
the pocket of air in the intra-lock 
compartment would go as it 
rushed into Hold-A and dispersed 
— and Powers’ blood would gush 
from his nose and mouth and his 
lungs would come in clots from 
his mouth and his ghost would 
join the other ghosts that walked 
the black boulevard of space. 

“Mary!” 

He leaped through the narrow- 
ing aperture and sought to seize 
her arm and pull her away from 
the deadly dial. But while she had 
substance of sorts it was not the 
substance of flesh and bone and 
he could not hold on to her. 

The inner lock had almost 
closed. He jumped through the 
narrow opening, barely in time. 
The pattern was no more but 
traces of his trance still remained. 
He watched, horrified, as the lock 
closed the rest of the way, sealing 
Mary in the airless hold. 

Then the last traces of the trance 
vanished and sanity returned. 

The ship had tried to kill him. 
Why? 

He reentered the lift, reacti- 
vated it. He was sweating when 
he stepped out on the lower deck. 
Why should the ship want to kill 



TO TOUCH A STAR 



41 




him? He climbed the companion- 
way to the living quarters, walked 
down the corridor to the lounge. 
Entering, he swept checkerboard 
and checkers from the table and 
sat down. He noticed that his 
hands were trembling. 

H E WASN’T particularly sur- 
prised when Mary material- 
ized opposite him. She was sitting 
in the other chair as though she’d 
been there all along. Her right el- 
bow rested on the tabletop and 
her chin was cupped in the palm 
of her right hand. 

She said, “You have more indi- 
viduality than I thought.’’ 

“Why?’’ he asked hoarsely. 
“Why, Mary — why?’’ 

“I’m a supership — remember?’’ 
The truth came hdme to him 
then. Superships were conditioned 
to react when stolen. 

But how did tftey know when 
they were stolen? Specifically, 
how had this one known? How 
had he betrayed himself? 

He put the question to Mary. 

She answered, “By that glib lie 
you told this afternoon when I 
asked why you had only partially 
programed me. It would have 
taxed the credulity of an idiot and 
an idiot I am not. I should have 
guessed the truth from the empti- 
ness of my holds,’’ she added al- 
most ruefully, “but I did not, be- 
cause according to my data 
freighters occasionally do leave 
home port without cargo.’’ 



“Do you know why I stole 
you?’’ Powers asked. “Do you 
know, Mary, why I’m going to 
Extend?’’ 

She shook her head. “It makes 
no difference.’’ 

“But it does make a differ- 
ence,’’ Powers said desperately. 
“All you have to do is bear with 
me for another forty-eight hours. 
We’ll have reached Extend by that 
time and have completed two or- 
bits around it. That’s all I want 
— two orbits. Then I’ll program 
you to return to Twilight and the 
minute we arrive I’ll turn myself 
in to the port authority.” 

“Talk sense, Ben.” 

“All right, I will,” Powers said. 
“If you kill me you’re as good as 
dead yourself, because you can’t 
reprogram yourself. You’ll simply 
stay on your present course, go 
into orbit around Extend and 
stay in orbit.” 

She shook her head. “Ben, Ben 
— why do you persist in thinking 
superships are dumb? The only 
reason I can’t reprogram myself 
is because like all superships I’m 
conditioned to obey the, program- 
ing of the pilot. But only as long 
as the pilot is alive. The minute 
you’re dead I’ll be free to go 
wherever I please.” 

Powers sighed. It had been a 
lousy hand but he had played it 
for all it was worth. 

For some reason Mary’s face 
was less distinct now than it had 
been a few moments ago. But he 



42 



IF 




was aware of this only in the back 
part of his mind. 

“I’ll tell you one thing,’’ he 
said. “You’ll find me a little more 
difficult to deal with now that I’m 
alerted. You won’t be able to hyp- 
notize me with a checker game 
again — that’s for sure. Nor,” he 
added with a rueful smile, “get 
me into a prehypnotic state by 
feeding me souped-up mint jelly.” 

A thought struck him. Why 
hadn’t she simply poisoned him 
and been done with it? But he 
didn’t bother to ask the question, 
not only because she wouldn’t 
have given him a straight answer 
but because he guessed the truth— 
there were no suitable toxins on 
board. 

He said, “Well, anyway, it was 
a good try.” 

“I’ll do better next time.” 

The matter-of-fact way she said 
it sent a shiver through him. He 
realized suddenly— consciously 
this time — that her face was 
blurred. Transferring his gaze to 
the wall behind her he found that 
it, too, was blurred. So were the 
other aspects of the room. For a 
moment he thought that she had 
somehow contrived to drug him 
again — then he noticed that the 
air was shimmering, as though 
filled with foreign matter, and the 
truth overwhelmed him. 

He was on his feet, shouting, 
“We’re entering a Beta Tau 
storm! Why aren’t your alarms 
sounding?” 



She smiled demurely up at him. 
“Don’t shout at me, Ben. You 
programed the course.” 

He whirled, ran out of the room 
and down the corridor toward 
the protective-equipment lockers. 
Laughter sounded behind him — 
Mary’s. It died abruptly when he 
reached the storage room and 
slammed the door behind him. 
The lockers were on the opposite 
wall. 



3. Later the ancients discovered 
that prolonged exposure to Chi - 
MuZeta resulted in disintegra- 
tion. Their first inkling of this 
came when the special-alloy tanks 
they had devised for transporting 
and storing the “ radiation ' trans- 
muted from a solid to a translu- 
cent and finally to a transparent 
state. They suspected that there 
might be still another phase and 
tentatively named it “ transinte- 
gration' " — a term that endures to 
this day. But despite the acciden- 
tal accuracy of the term the an- 
cients still hadn't the faintest con- 
ception of the true nature of the 
force at their fingertips , nor would 
they guess for another hundred 
years that ChiMuZeta in its ulti- 
mate form is an Anti-Paradox 
Manifestation — a force created 
in a star by the cosmos in order to 
stabilize the present by filling in 
hiatuses — and correcting their 
accompanying inconsistencies — 

in the past — hiatuses occasioned

by mankind's unconscious ability 
to create en masse . 

HEN POWERS next saw 
Mary he was seated before 
the viewscreen in the chart room 
wearing a synthi-lead suit that 
weighed nearly one hundred 
pounds. He was looking at the 
Blue Star, which now filled the 
screen and about which the ship 
would shortly go into orbit. 

Mary materialized next to the 
screen — it was as though she had 
stepped through the bulkhead. 
The photon filter had toned down 
Extend’s brilliance to a gentle hue 
that almost matched the color of 
her uniform. 

She asked, “Comfortable, 
Ben?” 

He glared at her through the 
suit’s faceplate. 

“I know who you are now,” he 
said into the transmitter. “Keats 
saw you by the lake. You’re La 
Belle Dame Sans Merci. You’re 
Death.” 

“You’re jumping the gun, Ben. 
When Keats saw the lady he was 
dying. You didn’t get anywhere 
near enough Beta-Tau radiation 
to put you in an analogous fix.” 

“You sound disappointed.” 

“Iam.” 

“Bitch.” 

She grinned. “Why don’t you 
take off your suit, Ben? The 
storm’s safely behind us.” 

It was true and he almost fell 
for her suggestion. Then he saw 



that rime was forming on the 
viewscreen controls and on all 
the other metal parts in the room. 
Cold sweat came out on his fore- 
head and ran down into his eyes. 

“You’d like that, wouldn’t 
you?” he said. And then: “What’s 
the temperature out there?” 

“A cool minus four hundred 
and ten Fahrenheit and dropping. 
Come on out, Ben — it’s quite re- 
freshing.” 

“You opened all the locks?” 

“Every one. And that’s not all 
I did, Ben.” 

He did not need to ask what 
she meant. For some time now he 
had been aware of a growing heav- 
iness in his limbs. Tentatively he 
tried to raise his right arm, found 
that he could barely do so. And 
when he tried to stand he only 
half-succeeded, then collapsed 
back into the chair. 

He estimated his weight, suit 
and all, to be about eight hundred 
and seventy pounds. 

Mary was grinning at him. 

“Three G’s were all I could 
muster. My artificial-grav unit 
isn’t what it should be.” 

How long could he endure 
three G’s? And how much oxygen 
did he have left? A glance at the 
indicator informed him that he 
had a thirty-five-hour supply. 
More than enough to see him 
through two orbits. As for the 
suit, it would be no hindrance — 
it kept out Beta-Tau radiation 
but not ChiMuZeta.

IF 




But what then? How would he 
reprogram the ship if he couldn’t 
move out of his chair? 

But he would be able to move 
out of his chair. When all of the 
chips were down, Mary would 
have to turn down the grav-unit. 
If she didn’t she, too, would face 
disintegration. 

She hadn’t won, then, after all. 
From the way she continued to 
grin at him, though, you would 
have thought she had. 

She <said, “In about a day and 
a half you’ll be dead. Why don’t 
you give up the ghost now?’’ 

“In a day and a half,’’ Powers 
said, “we’ll be in our third orbit 
around Extend. Doesn’t that 
mean anything to you?’’ 

“Only that you’ll be dead.’’ 
Clearly she did not know — 
probably because her builders, in 
view of the fact that none of the 
commercial routes came anywhere 
near Extend, hadn’t thought it 
necessary to include the data in 
her memory banks — that if she 
exceeded two orbits around Ex- 
tend she would be running the 
risk of disintegration. Would he, 
when the time came, be able to 
convince her that the only way 
she could save her own “life’’ was 
by saving his? 

It was a chance he would have 
to take. Because if he tried to con- 
vince her now and succeeded she 
would try another means of kill- 
ing him and this time the attempt 
might very well come off. By keep- 



ing her in ignorance for a while he 
could obtain the time he needed. 

“Well, I’ll leave you to your 
thoughts, Ben,” she said. “I imag- 
ine you have quite a few.” 

And so saying, she dematerial- 
ized. 

The Mary gave a slight shudder 
as the first braking rocket fired. 
A series of shudders followed as 
successive rockets discharged 
themselves. Then the Mary was in 
orbit. 

4. Most paradoxes involve reli- 
gious legends that through the 
ages successive generations of be- 
lievers have turned into fact . Anti- 
Paradox Manifestations occur 
when such legends finally become 
fact and lie in wait till mankind 
discovers them and — in the case 
of the ancients — misinterprets 
them and unwittingly supplies 
them with the ingredients neces- 
sary for the correction. In ancient 
times, APMs sometimes endured 
for thousands of years. 

W HEN Mary next material- 
ized the ship had entered its 
second orbit around Extend. She 
was furious. 

“What kind of a pilot are you, 
Powers?” she demanded. “We’re 
falling into the sun!” 

At first Powers thought she was 
lying. Then he saw that the rime 
had vanished from the control 
knobs and he discovered that he 
could stand up.

“How — how much altitude 
have we lost?” 

“Four million miles and every 
second we stand here we’re losing 
thousands more. Get out of that 
suit and into the programing 
room before it’s too late!” 

He could only stand there. Four 
million miles — more like five mil- 
lion by now. It was already too 
late. According to the briefing he 
had received from the ChiMuZeta 
techs, the intensity of ChiMuZeta 
radiation at even minus one mil- 
lion miles was double that of im- 
potentialization level. 

He had spent hours program- 
ing the course, had checked and 
double-checked the orbital-velo- 
city-altitude ratio. How could he 
possibly have erred? 

^Suddenly out of a corner of 
his mind came a thought he had 
kicked around shortly after the 
briefing and then forgotten about: 
how could the first man to orbit 
Extend have found the impoten- 
tialization level by accident? The 
odds against his doing so were 
staggering. 

Perhaps he hadn’t found it by 
accident. 

And perhaps Powers’ miscal- 
culation wasn’t an accident either. 
Perhaps he and Mary were pieces 
on a cosmic checkerboard with 
no more volition than the check- 
ers they themselves had used so 
short a time ago. 

But his insight went no deeper. 
He felt the awesome shudder 



that passed through the ship as 
its overheated drive went off, saw 
the fiery surface of Extend take 
on dreadful detail as the Mary’s 
fall accelerated. He heard Mary’s 
screams as she tried vainly to pull 
him from the room. He saw the 
bulkheads shimmer, then fade 
away as disintegration began. 

And then he knew no more. 



5. APMs, being a part of basic 
reality, are not subject to time: 
this is a restriction which we our - 
selves impose upon them. Hence 
the seeming anachronism result - 
ing from an A PM correction is an 
anachronism only in our own 
eyes, and not a true anachronism 
at all. 

I N THE dream that was not a 
dream Powers climbed a black 
mountain, descended into a dark 
abyss from whose depths stars 
could be seen shining high in the 
immensities. He stood there dark- 
ly, looking up at them, then lifting 
his arms to them he seized their 
light and wove a golden ladder 
which he climbed like Jacob into 
heaven. There lay the stars before 
him in a great black river of space- 
time — he straddled the river and 
looked down into its depths and 
saw that it did not flow but lay 
there like a dark immobile inter- 
val; and through the interval 
swam the fishes of men. He saw 
other things in the river, too, he 



46 



IF 




saw nebulae and planets and ships 
and suddenly he saw the Mary — 
and Mary and the Mary were 
one, swimming in the darkness of 
the river. 

He could see all of the river be- 
cause it occupied neither space 
nor time although it embodied- 
both. It lay there Mobius-strip- 
like beneath him, with its stars 
and planets and ships and silly 
men-fish going nowhere. It was 
his river, there for him to fish in 
and if he chose he could become a 
fish himself. Around him in the 
darkness he sensed other beings 
like himself and knew that they 
owned rivers, too, with fishes in 
them. I will become a fish for a 
while, he thought evilly, and di- 
minished down into the static 
stream and stepped out upon a 
planet called Sacred Heart. 

He saw a park and entered into 
the cool shade of trees and made 
his way to a round white building 
with a tall tower on top. He 
thought whimsically, Here are 
mortals who presume to be my 
wives , and he passed through a 
wide entranceway and into the 
Cloister and climbed a flight of 
stairs to the chapel where the 
Holy Sisters were praying. When 
they saw him, they screamed his 
crime. 

He left the building and ex- 
ceeded and stood above his river, 
looking down into the oneness of 
past-present-future. There was a 
girl named Mary, he remembered, 



who had tried to kill him. She 
was not flesh and blood like the 
other fishes. She was a projection, 
but she had been devised by men 
and therefore had been com- 
pounded of race memories — and 
where those memories began, 
there would he find the basic Mary 
... He looked down into his riv- 
er and after a while he saw her in 
the fields and he diminished and — 

— stood before her. When the 
girl Mary saw him she did not 
flee. It was as though she had 
known that he was coming, as 
though she had prayed that he 
would come. She did not struggle 
when he seized her arm and pulled 
her into the dim shadows of an 
olive grove, nor when he divested 
her of her robes. “I shall have a 
child by thee,” she said when he 
had taken his revenge, “and he 
will be of virgin birth. For I know 
that thou art not like other men — 
that I have been chosen from 
amongst a thousand women to 
do thee honor.” 

He was mollified and no long- 
er bore her ill will. She was the 
basic Mary and she was good. It 
was the false memories that had 
intruded over the millennia that 
had given her guile and robbed 
her of compassion. 

He exceeded and looked down 
into his river and saw that all was 
well. After a while he caused a 
bright star to appear where none 
had been before, to show that he 
was pleased. •

LEE HARDING 



they had stopped over on Island 
One. In fact, he couldn’t recall 
a time when it had not been rain- 
ing on that vast oceanic world and 
its scattered islands. Never once 
had he looked out over the island 
without the gentle pervading film 
of rain coming between himself 
and the landscape, while overhead 
an unseen sun burnished the deep 
layer of cloud a hazy shade of cop- 
per. 



Hydria was only a whistlestop 
on the great bustle Outward. The 
water world was inexhaustible and 
it allowed the thirsty ships from 
Earth to drink their fill of reac- 
tion mass before they moved on 
with their urgent business of re- 
making the universe. There were 
richer prizes to be won than this 
almost landless world and the Ser- 
vice had contented itself with carv- 
ing out a landfall and stop-over 





port for its ships on one of the 
equatorial islands. So perfunctory 
was this activity that they hardly 
bothered to give the place a name, 
only a number. Hydria had noth- 
ing more that they could plunder 
and so she was spared the indigni- 
ties commensurate with terraform- 
ing, a rapacious process that had 
already remolded many brave new 
worlds in the delightful image of 
mother Earth. 

Yes, it had been raining and the 
Barain had loomed large on the 
wet tarmac — a great metal canis- 
ter from Earth, tended by Service- 
men in their smooth plastic suits, 
moving around the base of the mo- 
nolith like pale white grubs grop- 
ing around the carcass of some 
dead animal. 



S UITING up had become some- 
thing of a ritual. 

Marnsworth had first disposed 
of his captain’s uniform and then 
pulled on a flimsy transparent 
plastic sheath over his underwear. 
It would insulate his body and en- 
sure that it was maintained at the 
proper temperature regardless of 
his external environment. Over 
this he donned a heavier but in no 
way cumbersome survival suit. It 
was fitted out with a number of 
tiny powerpacks, from which fine 
cables sprouted like delicate vines, 
fed the thermostatic insulator un- 
derneath and provided power for 
the faint but adequate deadfield 



that radiated outward from the 
wide belt at his waist. He checked 
this carefully before he zipped shut 
the transparent parka fitted to the 
suit — the field would annihilate 
any dangerous microorganisms for 
quite some distance around him, 
ensuring that he could venture 
safely beyond the controlled en- 
vironment of his ship without fear 
of any serious contamination. 

Such caution was necessary. 
Many lives had been forfeited in 
the early and clumsy days of space 
exploration to inadequate person- 
nel protection. These days full sur- 
vival suiting was mandatory for all 
Servicemen, even if they only 
stepped outside for a few moments 
to urinate. More than a century 
of modifications had made living 
in spacesuits comfortable and he 
was the animal spirit of his age— a 
spaceman. A starship was his nat- 
ural environment. 

The Barain surrendered him to 
the Island. He was escalated to 
ground level with all the care that 
a child could expect from its moth- 
er. He planted his protected feet 
on the wet tarmac and waited while 
they broke out a skiff. 

He looked up and felt a sudden 
longing for the clear controlled 
skies of Earth. Through the sifting 
rain he could barely distinguish 
the Service buildings crowding the 
perimeter of the field. Fine detail 
was blurred by the pervading driz- 
zle, so that they loomed squat and 
ugly in the coppery sunlight. 



50 



IF 




Vaguely he could discern the fig- 
ures of some local landmen loung- 
ing against the buildings and 
studying the stranded starship. 
They seemed not to notice the rain, 
seemed also to draw some nourish- 
ment from the humid wetness and 
the pallid sunshine. Their chests 
were bared to both and they were 
probably prepared to spend the 
rest of their lives covered with the 
same warm film of moisture that 
was clouding his parka. If their 
dull faces had anything to com- 
municate it was obliterated by the 
drifting rain. 

High up in the belly of the Ba- 
rain a panel opened and a compact 
surface craft nosed its way out. A 
driver adept at his task guided the 
skiff down to a neat landing only a 
few paces away from where Dami- 
an Marnsworth waited. The cap- 
tain stepped forward impatiently, 
thanked the young Serviceman 
and assumed solitary command of 
the sleek craft. 

He sat down before the sparsely 
detailed instrument panel, fidg- 
eted nervously with the toggles 
and switches. It had been some 
time since he had driven a surface 
craft and, although it was capable 
of automatic piloting, he felt it 
essential that he become confident 
with the few manual controls be- 
fore he moved off. 

He looked straight ahead, trying 
to pierce the solid veil of water 
that enveloped the hazy outlines 
of the landfall buildings. Beyond 



them stretched the great rain for- 
ests of Island One that had swal- 
lowed up Gerard Childers and now 
kept him jealously hidden from the 
Barain and its crew. 

Childers had been the best 
drivesman he had ever known. 
He had disappeared several stop- 
overs ago. An immediate, quick 
and cursory search of the settle- 
ment had been sufficient to con- 
vince Marnsworth that his man 
had taken to the forest and was 
too well hidden for them to be 
able to flush him out with the lim- 
ited time at their disposal. 

Childers had timed his break 
for the very last few minutes of 
landfall time. Once the initial flur- 
ry of excitement had been over 
Marnsworth had had no recourse 
but to up-ship on schedule and re- 
turn to Earth with his second 
drivesman in charge of the engines. 

Technicians were plentiful and 
Service Schedules were, like all 
parts of the Plan, impressively ex- 
pensive. Each day spent away 
from Earth cost the administra- 
tion mega-credits and the eager 
expansion of Earth’s embryonic 
stellar empire was being accom- 
plished with all the thoroughness 
that three centuries of red tape 
could muster. A maximum of eight 
hours stopover was mandatory for 
all ships and any captain who ex- 
ceeded this limit without proper 
justification was quickly broken. 

A minor technician just wasn’t 
worth it. 



SPACEMAN

B UT for Damian Marnsworth 
the situation went deeper than 
that; so deep that it hurt and had 
left a small weeping wound that 
refused to heal. Gerard Childers 
had been more than a mere tech- 
nical subordinate— he had been a 
friend. They had schooled together 
and stepped out in the great ships 
to master space together and in 
this respect Childers’ desertion 
had assumed the quality of a moral 
betrayal. He had left without a 
word of explanation, without any 
warning whatsoever — but this day 
Marnsworth was determined to 
challenge the rain forests and 
wrest from Childers the reason for 
his madness. 

In his hands he held a map, a 
clumsy effort drawn by one of the 
local landmen the trip before last. 
It had cost him a considerable 
amount of money — but not so 
much that it could not be safely 
written off into petty cash— and 
the information he had drawn 
from it and fed into the skiff’s 
auto-pilot would guide him to 
Childers. Marnsworth had 
wormed the crude drawing out of 
a drunken recluse in the Service 
bar — perhaps it was the way land- 
men disintegrated their society and 
fragmented into so many different 
forms that made them seem so 
disgusting — and he had been rest- 
lessly waiting for an opportunity 
that would enable him to put it to 
use. 

And this time he had one. Deep 



in the Barains belly an over- 
stressed and underserviced main 
drive unit was undergoing urgent- 
ly needed repairs. Tire work would 
take several days. The task was 
complex and only when the chief 
engineer had the massive engine 
stripped down and examined 
would he know what to do and how 
long it would take to reassemble 
and test the unit. 

There would be plenty of time. 
The clear canopy of the skiff was 
already beaded with moisture. 
Marnsworth moved a toggle that 
set the auto-pilot in motion. The 
skiff moved skyward, hesitated for 
a moment several hundred feet 
above the tarmac while it checked 
the coordinates for Childers’ hide- 
out and then skimmed off over the 
settlement in the direction of the 
great northern rain forest. 

As he passed over the shallow 
line of buildings Marnsworth saw 
several faces turned up toward the 
skiff. They were local landmen 
and for a brief moment he could 
see them clearly enough to note 
the wet hair plastered against their 
faces — he looked quickly away. All 
Servicemen shared this instinctive 
aversion to landmen, if only be- 
cause they were living proof that 
the Plan was not always infallible. 
Genetic prediction and selection 
were still infant sciences — but 
time would improve the techniques 
of control so that deviations from 
the goal would become fewer and 
ultimately disappear, and the

Empire would be populated by a 
truly space-bred society. In the 
meantime the Administration 
maintained a tolerant attitude to- 
ward its outcasts and sometimes 
even supported them in their ab- 
surd little enterprises. The un- 
wanted worlds had become an 
ideal dumping place for social 
misfits. 

The settlement disappeared be- 
hind him. The clouds and the rain 
closed in. The skiff gradually 
sought altitude so that it would be 
prepared for the mountain range 
that began some distance ahead. 

II 

I SLAND ONE was shaped like 
a blunt heart, inclined south- 
east across the equator. At the 
southern narrower end were two 
smaller islands grouped a few 
miles apart about thirty miles off- 
shore, inhospitable rocks un- 
worthy even of the numbers doled 
out to their larger brothers by the 
original cartographers of Hydria. 

The island was heavily timbered 
and bore a crooked back under- 
neath the lush, wet forests. This 
serrated ridge crossed the island 
from east to west and was the clos- 
est thing to a mountain range that 
the fresh young world had ever 
known. It made a long, slow climb 
for the small surface craft. 

But Marnsworth was in no par- 
ticular hurry now that the journey 
had finally been instigated. 



He had spent most of his life on 
board some sort of spacecraft, 
studying interminable viewscreens 
and printouts and had managed to 
achieve a most sought-after func- 
tion of all Servicemen — he could 
almost switch himself off for long 
periods of time and allay the 
boredom of travel. And he did so 
now. He relaxed and waited, for 
this was the measure of his trade. 

More out of idleness than from 
any genuine curiosity, he acti- 
vated the external sensors of the 
skiff. The whispered sounds of 
the world below drifted into the 
cabin. But the forest did not chat- 
ter incessantly like some forests 
he had known; nor did it scream 
or whimper. No predator moved 
through the unseen undergrowth. 
Here dominion had been divided 
between birds and insects and an 
occasional herbivore and that ex- 
plained why the ecology of the is- 
land had always moved at such an 
infinitesimal rate — time had bare- 
ly touched this great world of wa- 
ter. 

He drowsed. Perhaps he should 
have felt nervous and excited at 
the prospect of tracking down Ge- 
rard Childers but emotions that 
could overpower his logical mind 
had been bred from his strain sev- 
eral generations ago. He almost 
slept until the skiff broke through 
the clouds and challenged the 
timberline. A bare sky gaped mo- 
mentarily before him and a golden 
sun burned bright and naked into 



SPACEMAN 



53 




his face. He looked away. 

The land that swept back from 
the narrow ridge of mountains re- 
minded him of the great game re- 
serves of Africa. The broad veldt- 
like stretches were a striking con- 
trast to the rain-drenched 
landscape he had been traveling 
over. 

The skiff soared easily over the 
flimsy backbone of the island and 
plunged straight down into a dense 
mist. The wound in the sky healed 
over and the clouds closed in. He 
relaxed again in his seat and 
checked his watch against the trip- 
meter on the control panel. 

Ninety-seven minutes and one 
hundred and eleven miles away 
from the settlement. The long 
climb had slowed down the skiff 
but now that the mountains had 
been passed it was downhill all 
the way to Childers’ retreat. 

He had rehearsed all sorts of 
dialogues with himself but now 
that he was close to his quarry he 
found that he could cast serious 
doubts on them all. What would 
he say? What could he say? At the 
moment he could think of nothing 
that wouldn’t sound offensive and 
presumptuous. Perhaps — and this 
was what he wished — perhaps 
they would both blunder their way 
through the initial confrontation 
and then, over a pleasant drink or 
two, some of the friendship they 
had shared might begin to flow 
between them again. 

He missed that more than any- 



thing else. Space had become with- 
drawn and lonely since Childers’ 
had deserted the Service. There 
had been a time when the universe 
had been their oyster. Whatever 
had possessed Childers to turn his 
back to it in such a perfunctory 
manner? 

W ITHOUT any warning the 
mist and rain disappeared. 
The skiff plunged into a wide val- 
ley. Gone were the rain forests and 
the sparse veldts, to be replaced by 
sweeping grasslands. A river broke 
free from the distant forest and 
played tag under the speeding 
craft. The land began to rise steep- 
ly on either side and finally pushed 
it, roaring and foaming whitely, 
through a narrow gorge and out 
into another, narrower valley. The 
skiff shot quickly through this 
natural pass and, once it had en- 
tered the valley beyond, began to 
describe a wide gliding arc that 
broke for the first time the single- 
minded purpose of its flight. 

A persistent beeping began on 
the control panel. 

Mamsworth tensed. A human 
habitation lay somewhere ahead. 
Childers’ retreat — or somebody 
else’s? Was the map a fake? 

He had thought of radioing 
ahead to announce his arrival but 
he wasn’t sure that Childers would 
appreciate a call. There was no 
point in putting his old friend un- 
necessarily on edge. 

Cultivated fields passed by un-

IF 




derneath. He leaned forward, the 
better to observe the new land- 
scape. Human hands had molded 
this land to some purpose. Neat 
plantations of some sort of bush 
spread down the river’s edge. This 
was no fetid swamp — Childers 
had chosen well. Perhaps his mad- 
ness was not quite as intense as 
Marnsworth had imagined — this 
landscape had been designed with 
great care and affection. 

The skiff accelerated briefly to 
grab an extra few feet of altitude 
to fly over a wide belt of trees. It 
dropped abruptly into an enor- 
mous clearing. A small white 
house, festooned with colorful 
creepers, was set almost in the 
very center of this smooth area. It 
was U-shaped, its front aspect fac- 
ing southwest so that it took in the 
curving elbow of the river, the dim 
mountains in the distance — hid- 
den now by tumbling rain clouds 
— and Marnsworth’s descending 
surface craft. 

The control panel beeped three 
times and was still. The skiff hov- 
ered expectantly, waiting for 
Marnsworth to resume manual 
control and descend. But a cold 
nervousness had suddenly gripped 
him. It made him fumble at the 
controls with fingers that had sud- 
denly become inexpert. He won- 
dered if the common audacity of 
his visit had been ill-planned. 
What sort of a reception could he 
expect from a man who was al- 
ready three years a stranger? 



Well, he would soon find out. 
No sense turning back now that he 
had come this far. 

He sent the skiff gliding cau- 
tiously down. It set down on the 
grass and he cut the motors and 
sat for a few breathless moments 
while they idled away into silence. 
There was such an unnatural calm 
about the valley that he was reluc- 
tant to disfigure the silence with 
any abrupt movement. 

There was no sign of activity 
from the house, no indication 
that his arrival had been noted. 
Either Childers did not possess 
even a rudimentary sensor or he 
was deaf — or disinterested. 

Marnsworth slipped out of his 
seatbelt and swung back the can- 
opy. He jumped lightly to the 
ground. His suit lacked an ampli- 
fier, but the light gravity of Hydria 
made movement effortless even for 
his meager muscles. He felt the 
wet grass give under his weight. 
The outside temperature was high 
— so was the humidity — but his 
suit filtered out these unpleasant 
environmental things. He flicked 
on his sensors and allowed the 
moist and quiet sounds of Island 
One to make an impression. 

H E WAS still standing in the 
same spot several minutes 
later when the front door of the 
white house swung open. He saw 
a figure hesitating behind the deep 
shadow. Then it stepped forward 
into the sunlight. 



SPACEMAN 



55 




Marnsworth gave a start. At 
first he wasn’t sure that this actu- 
ally was Gerard Childers but as 
the man moved toward him with 
bold, unfrightened steps, he real- 
ized with a sinking heart that this 
— this creature — was indeed his 
old friend but scarcely recogniz- 
able, with the upper half of his 
body bared to the weather and 
with a heavy growth of beard dis- 
figuring his face. He wore only a 
pair of dun shorts and his bare feet 
crushed the wet grass. 

The sensors in Marnsworth’s 
suit were sensitive. They picked up 
the words the other man was 
mumbling. 

“Damian — good God, what 
brings you here?” 

The outward appearance of his 
friend might have been trans- 
figured by life under such alien 
conditions but at least the voice 
was familiar. Marnsworth stepped 
forward eagerly, reached out and 
Childers gripped his plastic hand 
and pumped it vigorously. 

“Hello, Gerard.” He felt shy 
and foolish, as though he didn’t 
really belong here, so far from his 
ship. “I came out to see what 
you’ve been doing with yourself.” 

Childers smile held an uncom- 
fortable edge. “I hope you haven’t 
come to try and impress me back 
into the Service or anything like 
that?” 

MarnswoTth shook his head. 
“No. It’s just that — well, the ship’s 



laid up for a few days at the settle- 
ment. I thought I’d take advan- 
tage of the break to come and look 
you up, find out what you’ve been 
doing these past few years.” 

Childers seemed to relax a little. 
“Always knew that rustbucket 
would let you down one day.” 

“Oh, it’s not the Queen” 
Marnsworth explained. “The Ba- 
rain. A new ship. This is only her 
third trip out. Her main drive’s 
been giving us hell ever since she 
was commissioned — ” 

Childers placed a brawny, sun- 
tanned arm around Marnsworth’s 
plastic shoulders and guided him 
toward the house. 

“Well, it isn’t every day we get 
a visiting spaceman—” 

The house was cool inside but 
Marnsworth could detect no 
threshold whirr of conditioning, so 
he did not unzip his parka. 

Childers eyed him quizzically. 
“Aren’t you going to take that 
damned thing off?” 

Without waiting for an answer 
he moved across the room and 
slid back a panel in the wall to re- 
veal an array of bottles and glass- 
es. Marnsworth began to feel wel- 
come but a residue of his curious 
embarrassment remained. He ges- 
tured awkwardly with his smooth 
hands. 

“I hope you realize that you’ve 
had a damned sight longer to get 
used to this air than I have.” 
Childers looked up from the 
dark drink he was pouring.

IF 




“Oh, yes. I’d forgotten that. 
Does that mean you’d turn your 
nose up at a local beverage?” 
“Hardly likely.” 

“Good.” 

Marnsworth took a deep breath 
and unzipped his parka. He shiv- 
ered as the humid air struck his 
face and his hand shook a little 
when it reached for the drink. 

The beverage was raw and un- 
familiar and it fought its way down 
his throat like a living animate But 
once it had arrived in his belly he 
found he could experience an 
agreeable warmth spreading 
through his body — intoxicants 
could vary in taste but their ef- 
fect never varied from one world 
to another. He found the stuffi- 
ness in the air most disagreeable 
but at this stage he felt much too 
polite to create any difficulties. 

Childers motioned him into a 
chair and sat down beside him. 

“Don’t often have people up 
from the settlement,” he said. “At 
least, not Service people.” 

Marnsworth found his chair un- 
comfortable. It had been hewn 
from some natural material and 
was quite hard beneath him. But 
he made no comment and avoided 
looking directly at Childers. He 
still felt residual horror at the 
changes in his friend. Something 
other than the fierce u.v. had 
burned Childers’ face into hard, 
coarse lines and bleached his hair 
with wide bands of gray. 

Both men were in their middle 



forties but in contrast to his host 
Marnsworth had the bland, un- 
troubled and smooth face of an 
adolescent. He sat behind his suit 
and it nursed him and cared for 
him, in much the same manner as 
his ship looked after him while 
they moved between one world 
and another, one year and the 
next. He was slim and fragile and 
unaccustomed to the hardships of 
living on the land. His environ- 
ment was space and his strength 
could be found a hundred thou- 
sandfold in any of the amplifiers 
he was called upon to use. 

Was it possible that Childers 
had been unable to maintain his 
rejuvenants since he had left the 
Service? Was that why he looked 
so old after only three short years? 

M arnsworth, coughed 

discreetly, suggesting that 
the liquor had troubled his throat. 

“You seem to have settled in 
rather well.” 

One had to be sociable, other- 
wise an embarrassed silence would 
epgulf them. 

Childers managed a wry gri- 
mace. “Well, the first few months 
were the worst. After that, well, 
everything became a little easier.” 
“I see.” But no, he did not really 
see. “The — acclimatization?” 
“Something like that. You like 
the wine?” 

Marnsworth said that he did— 
with reservations — and accepted 
another.

The house was large by the stan- 
dards he was accustomed to. Plen- 
ty of wide, full-length windows to 
let in the coppery sunlight and if 
the furniture seemed sparse and 
crude by some standards, it was 
at least functional. It was the ex- 
cess of free space that he found 
most disconcerting. On board ship 
and at home— in fact anywhere on 
Earth, for that matter — living 
space was at a premium. Marns- 
worth had been tailored to fit a 
cramped environment — and to fit 
graciously, without asking awk- 
ward questions. 

Childers was staring down at his 
drink. Without looking up he said, 
“I suppose you’d like to know why 
I left?” 

Marnsworth did not answer but 
let him continue. 

“Well, it was just something I 
had to do, that’s all. Then and 
there — at that moment. Without 
any temporizing. But I’m sorry if 
you’ve been through any trouble.” 

No, no trouble , Marnsworth 
thought. Only pain. 

“But you see, there wasn’t time 
to — to think about things like that. 
About the Service. About com- 
mand and all those other meaning- 
less things. I just couldn’t stand 
being locked up inside that great 
tin can any longer. I had to get 
out.” 

“And so you threw up your 
work, your career, your pension,” 
Marnsworth said. “And for what, 
Gerard, for what?” He gestured to 



take in their surroundings. “For 
this?” 

Childers didn’t answer. And his 
face had not yet lifted from con- 
templating an empty glass. 

Marnsworth felt failure like a 
great weight lodged in his lungs. 

“All I know, Gerard, is that 
you’ve changed — changed much 
since I saw you last. And have you 
done it all for this?” 

Childers raised his head slowly 
and^there was an honesty in his 
eyes that had not been there be- 
fore. 

“You haven’t changed much at 
all,” he said and then looked 
quickly away, as though embar- 
rased by what he saw. “As you’ve 
probably guessed, I haven’t been 
taking my shots since I left the 
Service — and there’s a rather 
frightening change in the first six 
months or so. But after that things 
tend to even out and you get used 
to your new appearance. You put 
on weight. If you’re working, then 
you start buildings muscles. The 
sun tans you — your body sweats. 
A lot of things happen. But I guess 
it’s in the face that a man shows 
it most.” 

Suddenly furious, Marnsworth 
jumped to his feet. “I can under- 
stand anybody wanting out,” he 
cried, “but why in God’s name did 
you throw away your youth?” 

Childers looked puzzled. “But 
did I do that, Damian? Did I real- 
ly? Has it ever occurred to you 
just how costly those treatments 



58 



IF 




are when you haven’t access to 
Service wages? Not everyone back 
home can afford them either — or 
perhaps you’ve conveniently for- 
gotten that? Spacemen tend to for- 
get everything that is not absolute- 
ly necessary to their profession. 
And I found that I could do with- 
out my shots — as I could do with- 
out most of the things that Earth 
had given me. Once you have dis- 
carded one myth you can discard 
them all.” 

Marnsworth said nothing and 
Childers continued. 

“Did yoir know that rejuvena- 
tion is our greatest lie? Oh, we 
keep ourselves young on the sur- 
face, on the skin where it shows — 
at least those of us who can afford 
to do so — but it’s only a sickly 
veneer. The flesh may stay young 
but our minds aren’t fooled. 
They’re much too clever to be 
tricked by our smart little drugs. 
We age our mind through exper- 
ience, regardless of the physical 
rejuvenation that continually re- 
makes us — but what, do you sup- 
pose, will be the end of all this? 
Will our minds get surfeited with 
accumulated inertia and finally 
stop from sheer exhaustion? I 
suppose it would be interesting to 
find out — but I no longer wish for 
that sort of knowledge. I have — 
other things.” 

M arnsworth was breath- 
ing heavily in the humid at- 
mosphere. His eyes were bright. 



“Some day,” he said, “some day 
they will find a way to — ” 

“To rejuvenate the mind? How 
awful. But I suppose they will do 
it if they’ve set their minds to it. 
Man has made a habit of accom- 
plishment. But really — one doesn’t 
need their clever chemicals. Re- 
juvenation of a tired mind is a sim- 
ple process for those who are pre- 
pared to look. I found it here. Oth- 
ers look elsewhere.” 4 

Marnsworth realized that he 
was as far from Gerard Childers 
as he had been back at the settle- 
ment. Was there no way of bridg- 
ing this enormous gulf? 

“Gerard,” he began, his voice 
soft and patient, “do you remem- 
ber how we used to talk in the old 
days, back at school?” 

“About how big the universe 
was and how mankind would chart 
its secrets and what an adventure 
it would be — ” 

“To be part of it--” 

“And wouldn’t it be grand?” 
“Then you haven’t forgotten?” 
“No, of course not. But that 
was all so long ago, Damian, and 
we were such fools.” 

“But your training — all those 
years — ” 

“And for what? A few years out 
of my life — not worth crying over. 
Oh, I won’t deny that I was once 
as starry-eyed as any young ca- 
det—” 

“You were more than that. You 
were one of the foremost physi- 
cists of your time — and the best 



SPACEMAN 



59 




damned drivesman I ever knew. 
And you left it all — ran away like 
some crazy kid. And only for 
this!” 

A shadow passed across Chil- 
ders’ face. He became very seri- 
ous. 

“Listen, Damian. I will tell you 
something. Something very im- 
portant to me — and to every- 
body. When I had finished all 
those wonderful years of school- 
ing, of breaking God down into 
little pieces so that I could measure 
Him and analyze Him and won- 
dering what to do with what I 
found — after I had accumulated 
all this useless knowledge, do you 
know where I found myself? That’s 
right — staring at gauges and me- 
ters and tapping out commands to 
machines more clever than my- 
self, nursing spaceships through 
hyper-space and watching little 
colored lights winking on and off. 
And that was all, Damian — only 
that. Ten years of my life studying 
so that I would wind up acting as 
caretaker to a machine.” 

“But such work demands that 
sort of study,” Marnsworth pro- 
tested. “Surely you don’t ex- 
pect—” 

“I expect nothing — not any 
more. Only never to waste my life 
in such a useless fashion. I want to 
feel the pressure of a world be- 
neath my feet; I want fresh air in 
my lungs and not the canned stuff 
we’re too used to accepting as the 
real thing. I don’t want to have to 



drag my environment around with 
me to every God-forsaken corner 
of the universe. Damn it all, we’ve 
become a race of galactic sculptors 
running around the cosmos put- 
ting Earth’s face on every habit- 
able world we find — can’t you see 
that’s blasphemous?” 

Ill 

ARNSWORTH’S thoughts 
were locked in a nexus of 
consternation; he could not speak. 
Impatient words had piled up into 
an unmanageable lump in his 
throat and his lips twitched in an 
agitation to free them. His whole 
body was shaking inside the pro- 
tective suit. 

The fierce light faded suddenly 
from Childers’ eyes. He looked 
past Marnsworth and his face 
softened. The spaceman followed 
the direction of his gaze and was 
surprised to find a young woman 
standing in the doorway. 

Childers stood up. “Rachel, 
this is Damian Marnsworth — Cap- 
tain Marnsworth. My old chief. 
Damian — my wife.” 

Her quiet entry helped to break 
the terrible stasis that had gripped 
the spaceman. He struggled awk- 
wardly to his feet and dipped his 
head sharply in a gentleman’s 
acknowledgment. 

“What a pleasant surprise, Mrs. 
Childers,’’ he said. “I had no 
idea — ” 

He had assumed that Childers 




60 



IF 




lived alone in his retreat — nobody 
had mentioned the woman. She 
was extraordinarily attractive 
even to a spaceman’s eyes — but 
she was regarding him with a cold 
grace he found disquieting. 

She wore a simple orange shift 
and her dark body — darker even 
than her husband’s — moved vis- 
ibly underneath the material as 
she crossed the room. Probably 
quite a bit of African and Euras- 
ian somewhere along the line, he 
reckoned — particularly when one 
considered the almost impercep- 
tible slant of her luminous dark 
eyes. Her body was strong, supple 
and well proportioned, if slightly 
plump by some standards and her 
jet-black hair was pulled back into 
a bun at the base of her neck. She 
extended a courteous hand to 
Marnsworth but she did not suc- 
ceed in concealing the hostility in 
her eyes. 

“How very nice to see you. Cap- 
tain.’’ Her voice was soft and 
husky. It disturbed Marnsworth. 
“You are — most welcome. We 
don’t often have people from the 
Service visiting us.’’ 

He grasped her moist hand with 
his plastic fingers and sensed her 
displeasure like a mild electric 
shock passing up his arm. 

“Thank you.’’ 

Childers made a disparaging 
noise. 

“Damn fool lives in that suit. 
You’ll never get him out of it. 
that’s for sure.’’ 



Feeling a trifle foolish, Marns- 
worth explained to the woman — 
in detail — why his survival suit was 
necessary and how unaccustomed 
he was to being off-ship. While he 
talked her ambivilance seemed to 
soften a little. 

“You have a very nice — ah — 
estate here,’’ he babbled on, un- 
able to stop now for fear that the 
terrible nexus would grab him 
again. “Mrs. Childers, I must con- 
fess that I never — ’’ 

“Oh, for God’s sake, call her 
Rachel, will you?’’ Childers ex- 
ploded, exasperated. And then 
turned attentively to his wife. 
“Would you like a drink?’’ 

She nodded. While her husband 
poured for her she moved grace- 
fully across the room and sat down 
on an upholstered divan under 
the east window. The copper sun- 
light made her skin blaze. The 
vivid color of the shift was almost 
blinding to Mamsworth’s weak, 
spaceman’s eyes. She crossed her 
legs and Marnsworth realized that 
her feet were bare, like her hus- 
band’s. 

Of course she had timed her en- 
try with discretion, waiting until 
the two old friends had established 
some sort of rapport and then, 
with the penchant for perfect tim- 
ing that only beautiful women 
seemed to possess, had announced 
herself when her presence was 
most needed — her arrival had 
made their disagreements unim- 
portant for the moment.

“When do you have to be 
back?” Childers asked. 

“Well, I don’t really know. That 
damned drive could take days to 
fix and — ” 

“Then why not stay here with us 
for a while? Have yourself a holi- 
day away from that damned Ser- 
vice—’’ He bit his lip and 
shrugged apologetically, realizing 
he had made a mistake. “Matter 
of fact, Rachel and I are visiting 
some friends of ours this evening — 
a sort of party, you might call it. 
I think you’d enjoy yourself. As I 
remember, you were always one for 
a good time.” 

A good time . 

The words had meant something 
once, long ago, between schooling 
and the Service, when there had 
been time for things without Pur- 
pose. Something else that Marns- 
worth had forgotten. 

They were both watching him — 
the woman sipping at her wine, 
frankly curious, Childers with an 
edge of nervousness about him 
he seemed not quite able to un- 
derstand. Marnsworth sniffed. It 
was a painful gesture — his sinuses 
were swollen and irritated and he 
was finding it difficult to breathe. 

“You see,” Childers elaborated, 
“there’s quite a colony of us 
around here. Murray’s place is 
only about fourteen miles north, 
on the other side of the river. Every 
month we have a gettogether at 
each other’s place — we take turns 
— and generally have ourselves a 



ball. It’s only when you’re isolated 
from people for a great deal of 
time that you begin to appreciate 
their company. I know you’re 
probably anxious to get back to 
your ship but we’d be delighted to 
have you with us, wouldn’t we Ra- 
chel?” 

Marnsworth looked at the wom- 
an. Only her eyes were visible as 
she raised her glass to her lips. 
She inclined her head a little to 
one side and her answer was a 
husky whisper. 

“Of course.” 

Marnsworth fidgeted nervously. 
“Well—” What could he say? Of 
course he felt uncomfortable but 
an insatiable curiosity made him 
want to find out more about these 
people. There was an enigma here 
he should be able to understand. 
“If you think it would be all right 
with your friends?” 

Childers laughed and looked 
relieved. “But of course they won’t 
mind. And wait until you see what 
a fine bunch of people we’ve got 
here.” 

Childers placed a brawny arm 
around Marnsworth’s narrow 
shoulders and grabbed his arm ex- 
citedly. On the divan the woman 
sipped her drink and studied 
Marnsworth thoughtfully with a 
distant and impenetrable expres- 
sion. 

D USK came slowly to the is- 
land. No spectacular sunset 
transfigured the dull sky — the cop- 



62 



IF 




pery haze simply faded gradu- 
ally away, as though a finely ad- 
justable rheostat had been brought 
into play. 

Mamsworth had spent most of 
the afternoon wandering around 
Childers’ estate in the company of 
his old friend. In the process he 
had come to understand the ac- 
tivities that occupied the ex-Ser- 
viceman but he was still no nearer 
to comprehending his motives. 

Childers tilled and cultivated 
many acres by hand and the use of 
a few simple tools — there were no 
automatons that Marnsworth 
could see. The main crop was cof- 
fee, a local transplanting that had 
thrived at this altitude and enabled 
Childers and his wife to live com- 
fortably. Export of the popular 
beans ensured that the space peo- 
ple and their home world could en- 
joy the occasional draught of a 
non-synthetic stimulant, although 
the price levied on outworld goods 
was prohibitively high for all but 
the chosen elite. 

“I understand it retails back 
home for something like five cred- 
its an ounce,” Childers observed, 
“and that’s refined and adulter- 
ated.” 

“Five thirty-four,” Marnsworth 
corrected. 

“Is that so?” Childers smiled 
ruefully. “Well, Service pays us 
five and a half cents a pound — I 
can’t imagine that all that extra 
is made up of freight and han- 
dling. Somebody has sure cor- 



nered themselves a market in nat- 
ural coffee.” 

“You don’t seem concerned that 
somebody is making an enormous 
profit from all your work.” 

“Huh? Oh, I can’t be bothered 
about those things, Damian. They 
can do what they like after it leaves 
my hands. Everything I care for 
is here. They can have the rest.” 

The rain had persisted all after- 
noon. Now they sat in comfortable 
cane chairs on the veranda of Chil- 
ders’ house and watched the sun- 
light fade from the heavy clouds. 
Marnsworth had apologized and 
zipped up his parka several hours 
earlier. He had been unable to tol- 
erate the oppressive island atmos- 
phere any longer. The constant 
fall of fine rain and the high hu- 
midity were causing pain through 
his nasal cavities and putting a 
constricting sensation into his 
chest where the unfiltered air ram- 
paged. Now the subtle mechan- 
isms whirred soundlessly in his 
suit and flushed out the excessive 
moisture and warmth, so that his 
breathing became easier and a lit- 
tle of the discomfort was eased 
out of his head. 

He sat and stared at the soft cur- 
tain of moisture. Occasionally a 
light breeze would puff some of it 
toward the house and it would fall 
like sea-spray upon the verandah. 

“Does it ever stop?” he asked. 

“Sometimes. Do you find it de- 
pressing? We don't really notice it 
any more— not when it falls like 



SPACEMAN

this. One of the many advantages 
of having a low surface gravity. 
Point six-eight — or is it six-four? 
I seem to have forgotten.” 

Childers’ eyes were bright and 
clear and he could see well out in- 
to the darkening landscape. But 
Marnsworth’s view had been ob- 
scured for some time by the dis- 
torting film of moisture on the out- 
side of his parka. 

“Is this why you left the Ser- 
vice? Simply to be a landman? To 
move dirt around with your fin- 
gers and never know the stars 
again?” 

Childers looked up at the dark 
clouds where the stars were rarely 
visible. 

“If you mean, did I come here 
only for that, then I can’t really 
answer you. You see, we’ve only 
begun to discover what we want to 
do. I’ve been too busy relearning 
what it is to be myself to worry 
about motivations — but yes, I like 
it here. We like it here. I can’t 
think of going back to the Ser- 
vice — even if they would have me, 
which I doubt — so* where’s the 
sense of asking?” 

“Because I have to know.” 

“Why, Damian? Why is it im- 
portant that you should know why 
I came here when I don’t even 
know the multileveled answer my- 
self? All I know is that I could 
never be a Servicepian again — 
not with all that emptiness outside 
crowding to get in. I guess I just 
wasn’t made for it. Maybe Control 



goofed. It must happen sometimes. 
Sure, they mold us into a pat- 
tern, but how much can they moti- 
vate our subconscious? I believe 
that there are worlds — and Hydria 
is one of them — that reach out to 
some deep part of us we are un- 
aware of and these worlds com- 
municate with our subconscious in 
a way that Control never planned. 
But only some of us have need of 
and heed their summons. The mis- 
fits. The failures. The dropouts. 
The ones ill-wrought by Control.” 
He laughed and waved a hand at 
Marnsworth’s distorted and hor- 
rified face behind the clouded 
parka. “Oh, don’t worry, Dam- 
ian — you’re all right, I think. Con- 
trol made a fine job of you. But 
with me — and some others — they 
were clumsy. You are a creature 
of space — something new. But 
Rachel and I are landpeople. Per- 
haps the ultimate destiny of the 
human race is to put a fresh new 
face on the universe — one day they 
might even find some way of fit- 
ting out Earth with some fantas- 
tic sort of drive that will enable 
them to take their whole synthetic 
world out to the stars. But our 
roots are deeper, Damian. We 
love the land. There is something 
there that spaceman should not 
entirely forget.” 

“But your youth — ” Marns- 
worth struggled to speak. “Why 
did you discard your youth?” 

Childers shrugged and smiled 
an enigmatic smile. “It’s late,” he 



64 



IF 




said, getting up and studying the 
encroaching darkness. “We’d best 
go inside and get ready or we’ll 
have Rachel on our backs.’’ 

N umerous exits led off the 
main room but Marnsworth 
could see no doors. 

An open house — how very ex- 
traordinary . 

Rachel was waiting for them. 
She was standing at one of the 
exits — or entrances — a slight im- 
patience in her manner. She had 
changed into a plain white smock 
that came freely down to mid- 
thigh and exposed her long brown 
limbs to advantage. She was bare- 
foot still — it seemed to be a custom 
of the island — and her dark skin 
made a dramatic contrast with the 
smock. As he moved closer Marns- 
worth saw that she had some ar- 
rangement in her hair — he rea- 
lized with surprise that it was a 
fresh red flower. He saw beads of 
moisture still on it. 

A peculiar people . 

He felt suddenly ill at ease. He 
had opened his parka again from a 
desire to be courteous to this wom- 
an but suddenly, facing here like 
this, ready to leave, he felt a little 
conspicuous in his survival suit. 
He wondere'd if it had been such a 
good idea to agree to attend the lo- 
cal festivity or whatever it was 
called. 

Childers deciphered his inde- 
cision. 

“Don’t worry about that,” he 



said quickly, indicating Marns- 
worth’s suit. “They won’t mind— 
really they won’t.” 

And am I to be a speciman — a 
curiosity ? Marnsworth’s confi- 
dence had been badly shaken in 
the past few hours. Could he, just 
this once, and for only a few hours, 
submit to some small discomfi- 
ture, so that he might meet these 
people as an equal and not some 
oddity from Earth? 

“If you have something I can 
wear,” he said, “I’ll leave this stuff 
behind. I’d feel a bit of a fool, you 
know, walking in on your friends 
like this.” 

Rachel smiled and he found a 
new warmth in her eyes. 

“But of course,” she said and 
turned back through the entrance. 
“I’ll get you something.” 

A few minutes later she returned 
and handed the spaceman a pair 
of tan shorts and a bone-colored 
sleeveless jacket from her hus- 
band’s wardrobe. The jacket was a 
trifle big but the shorts, he saw 
with relief, were a stretch fabric. 
He took them and then stood feel- 
ing foolish while they stared at 
him. 

It was a bad moment. And then 
Rachel, with an intuitive under- 
standing of the situation, whisked 
back out of the room murmuring 
something about makeup. 

Marnsworth hastily stripped 
off his suit — he stood naked for a 
moment like a skinned vegetable. 

“It must feel strange,” Childers 



SPACEMAN

observed, “after all this time.” 
Which was true enough. A 
spaceman was not accustomed un- 
der social conditions or aboard 
ship to exposing overmuch of him- 
self. Not even back home, where 
one always swam in carefully fil- 
tered waters and alone and .... 

He dressed as quickly as he 
could in the strange outfit the 
woman had provided. 

T HE solitary wan moon of 
Hydria was struggling to 
pierce the clouds when they left 
the house — only a pale glow was 
visible on the horizon. They left — 
not in Marnsworth’s skiff but in a 
similar machine adapted to Chil- 
ders’ requirements. It was low and 
wide with ample cargo space in the 
rear and a single bench seat up 
front. They sat close together and 
Marnsworth was uncomfortably 
conscious of the nearness of Chil- 
ders’ wife, of her pressing against 
him and of the rich, musky odor 
of her skin. The subtle perfume 
she had sprinkled over her body 
did not completely mask this un- 
pleasantness from his suddenly 
critical olfactory sensibilities. But 
it didn’t offend him as much as it 
should. Something — perhaps the 
very strangeness of the environ- 
ment he was experiencing so di- 
rectly — had induced in his 
thoughts a delightful euphoria, so 
he relaxed and let his mind wan- 
der, instead of marshaling it dis- 
agreeably for the evening ahead. 



The sky cleared in patches where 
some small stars sputtered. Some- 
thing gripped his stomach and he 
looked quickly away. Outside the 
perpetual drizzle enveloped the 
clear canopy of the craft. 

The journey could not have 
taken more than twenty minutes 
but for Marnsworth it was a time 
of increasing discomfort. He was 
unaccustomed to this sort of prox- 
imity, sandwiched between two 
people as lightly clad as himself. 
And the air inside the skiff had 
become increasingly sticky. The 
odor of his own sweat mingled 
with that of Childers and his wife. 
He could feel it running down his 
sides in small, embarrasing rivu- 
lets. His naked arms were slick 
with moisture and he could feel 
Rachel’s warm wet shoulder press- 
ing against his own — nervous side- 
long glances showed him that her 
white shift had darkened in patch- 
es where it stretched tightly across 
her breasts. Once he shifted un- 
easily and she turned and smiled, 
considerately, as though she were 
aware of his discomfort and were 
trying to reassure him that the 
flight would soon be over. 

His head did not feel too bad. 
With the lowering of the sun the 
temperature had dropped con- 
siderably and this made the gen- 
eral humidity easier to bear. 

A white arc of the river blazed 
suddenly before them in the newly 
victorious moonlight. The skiff 
dropped toward a cluster of bright

IF 




lights along one shore. 

“That’s it,’’ Childers an- 
nounced. 

Marnsworth breathed a cau- 
tious sigh of relief. 

A large clearing was spread out 
below them. From this height the 
surrounding forest glittered 
through the drizzle like a minia- 
ture fairyland. 

“Murray’s wife loves decor,’’ 
Rachel explained. “She just adores 
lighting the place up for these 
gettogethers.’’ 

They landed near a group of 
similar machines at the edge of the 
clearing. Childers swung back the 
canopy and climbed out, motion- 
ing to Marnsworth to follow. 

The spaceman tensed, then 
dropped lightly to the ground. His 
body reacted predictably at the 
feel of wet grass underneath his 
bare feet but he did what he could 
to dispel the revulsion. He turned 
around and extended his hand 
automatically to Childers’ wife. 
She accepted it, a glimmer of old- 
world charm in her eyes, and 
climbed down from the skiff. Her 
hand was soft, moist and warm, 
like his own. 

“Thank you,’’ she said. 

They looked at each other for a 
fragment of time and Marnsworth 
could see that, although she had 
not managed to completely sup- 
press a mixture of distaste and 
amusement, she had thawed grad- 
ually toward him. He still sensed 
a remaining difference between 



them — a region of acceptance 
beyond which she was not pre- 
pared to move. Perhaps it was the 
gulf that had always existed and 
was continually widening between 
landpeople and the space society 
Marnsworth was part of. 

“This way,’’ Childers directed 
and led them across the lawn to- 
ward the gaily decorated patio. A 
number of people were already as- 
sembled. Marnsworth had the un- 
easy feeling that the group had 
been buzzing with conversation 
prior to their arrival and that a 
sudden silence had descended up- 
on them when they had failed to 
recognize Childers’ companion. 

Childers introduced him 
around. They were all dressed 
more or less alike, in the casual 
manner of the island. The men 
were mostly bare-chested and in 
shorts — the women wore short, 
filmy dresses and sleeveless, bo- 
lero-type vests. Some were naked 
from the waist up, like their men- 
folk. But it was the colors of the 
clothes that surprised Marns- 
worth. These people seemed to 
prefer the loudness of primary col- 
ors the way some people wanted 
their music played always at a 
high, ear-crashing volume. In the 
dazzling illumination the vivid 
blues and reds and yellows seemed 
to possess a strange life of their 
own — he had never before seen a 
group so gaily and dramatically 
dressed. Each individual was 
wrapped in his own bright haze,

trapped by the sifting rain and the 
constantly changing lights. Marns- 
worth blinked constantly under 
the assault and moved sometimes 
like a man only half awake. 

F INALLY he was introduced 
to Murray Wiseman. The 
spacemen found him to be an 
anachronism of his age, a stout 
man. His belly protruded well 
over the top of his shorts and his 
navel was a monstrous exclama- 
tion. He had a great thick thatch 
of body hair that the rain had 
slicked down all over his chest but, 
with the exception of a few miser- 
able gray tufts around his ears, he 
was quite bald. His pate shone 
wetly under the lights — the film of 
moisture had made it a fine reflec- 
tive surface. 

“So this is your visitor.” He 
pumped Marnsworth’s hand 
soundly. His eyes were alive and 
fierce and they made the spaceman 
want to turn away. 

“Damian Marnsworth,” Chil- 
ders introduced. “He’s from the 
Service — a captain. And my old 
boss. Got his ship laid up for a few 
days and popped out to see us. 
Damian, this is Murray Wise- 
man.” 

“Well, enjoy yourself, enjoy 
yourself,” Murray admonished. 
“We don’t often have visitors from 
outside.” 

He nodded to Rachel and then 
moved off to join his other guests. 
Marnsworth felt strange. His 



head began to swim and he 
reached out to take hold of a balus- 
trade. He felt that he was drown- 
ing in an ocean of age. The faces 
of the guests moved around him 
like ragged leaves in a whirlpool — 
he had never seen so many old 
people. On each and every one of 
them death seemed to have made 
a claim and worked an insidious 
pleasure. 

Rachel’s fingers clamped around 
his arm where it clung to the bal- 
ustrade. 

“Come over here.” 

He allowed her to lead him away 
from the patio toward the darker 
area of the clearing. She found 
him a seat and told him to sit 
down. He smiled sheepishly. And 
he was glad that she was at least 
adequately dressed — he had been 
shocked to see that some of the 
older women here had decided to 
wear only skirts or shorts. There 
were some things so repulsive 
about old age that one should 
avoid displaying them. Not that 
anybody here was much past forty. 
It was the ugly patina of aging in 
all their faces that he found dis- 
quieting. 

“Stay here,” she suggested, 
“and take it easy. I’ll get you 
something to drink.” 

A few minutes later she reap- 
peared with ^ small wooden tray 
loaded with dishes filled with fine 
food and two small mugs of red 
wine. 

“Here, try some of this.” 



68 



IF 




He sat up. 

“I don’t know if I should.” 

One had to be careful eating off- 
ship. 

“Gerard chose the food,” she 
explained. “He said it shouldn’t 
interfere with your delicate diges- 
tion.” Her smile was mischievous. 
“And the wine will help. It’s very 
gentle.” 

He found that it was. His stom- 
ach did not complain, so he in- 
vestigated some of the unfamiliar 
savories Childers had piled up on 
the tray. 

“Are you my guardian angel 
for the evening?” he asked. 

His breath had become a little 
labored and he wished he had 
brought along his suit, just in case. 

She laughed. 

“Well, somebody’s got to keep 
an eye on you. How are you feel- 
ing?” 

He shrugged. 

“The climate, you know — ” 

“Yes, I understand. It must be 
difficult.” 

He noticed drops of rain upon 
her long eyelashes — they made her 
eyes seem brighter than before. 
She really was a very beautiful 
woman — and one day that beauty 
would fade, would decay and all 
because the miraculous rejuve- 
nants were beyond these people’s 
grasp. Such neglect seemed crimi- 
nal. Back home her beauty would 
last for a century or more. Here, 
on this worthless world, it would 
be doomed in a few short years. 



“Try one of these, Damian.” 

He roused out of the creeping 
mental fog that was threatening to 
betray him and looked down at the 
bundle of dark red grapes in her 
hand. 

“They’re delicious,” she said. 

She had called him by his first 
name and for some reason that 
helped him to feel better. But his 
stomach protested the prospective 
invasion of the small fruits. 

“No — thank you. Really, I 
couldn’t eat another thing.” 

“Not even one — just to try? 
They really are tasty.” 

Reflections of colored, flashing 
lights danced in her dark eyes. 

“All right,” he groaned. “But 
just one.” 

He picked one of the grapes 
awkwardly — his limbs were be- 
coming unresponsive; he really 
should have brought some anti- 
intoxicants with him — and placed 
it into his mouth. He closed his 
teeth around it cautiously and felt 
the juice spurt out and bite his 
tongue, the pulpy flesh collapse. 
Whatever flavor it possessed was 
pleasant enough but dulled by the 
amount of rich food and wine he 
had previously consumed. 

“I think,” he began and swal- 
lowed, “I’ve had a little too much 
of — everything.” 

“No more wine?” 

“No. Too much of that, too.” 
But it was more than that — it 
was the warmth of all these happy 
bodies around him, the rising hu-

midity and the weakening euphor- 
ia — he felt drowsy. He wanted to 
sleep and in fact he must have 
slipped off then into a quiet, un- 
fussed doze without really noticing 
how tired he was. He awoke later 
with a start and found himself 
alone. 

Rachel had disappeared and he 
was in darkness. Somebody had 
extinguished all but a few of the 
festive lights and the remaining 
ones were so distant that they shed 
no light upon him. 

He sat up at once, confused. His 
head gave a lurch that matched a 
similar movement in his stomach, 
and he dared not get up for fear of 
shaming himself. 

He looked closely around him. 
The guests had moved back from 
the patio and congregated in a si- 
lent semicircle between him and 
the house. The patio blazed sud- 
denly with light and he realized 
that their attention was directed 
that way and not toward him. He 
relaxed. 

He heard a far-off roll of drums 
or some such percussive instru- 
ment. His ears pricked up. A num- 
ber of people had moved out onto 
the black and white tiled mosaic of 
the patio. They were dressed dif- 
ferently from the others. The wom- 
en wore long flowing white gowns 
and the men white pants suits, in- 
tricately embroidered. Their faces 
were hidden by what he considered 
to be some sort of ceremonial 
masks, and there was no sound 



now other than the swish-swish of 
the womens’ skirts on the tiles. 

The drums had ceased. 

The people moved to what ap- 
peared to be predetermined posi- 
tions on the patio. Others, clad 
more discreetly in somber capes 
and cowls, assumed their places in 
the background. Marnsworth saw 
that they carried with them a vari- 
ety of instruments, although he 
could not recognize any of them 
from memory. 

The patio light dimmed and the 
masked figures in the foreground 
were picked out one at a time by 
individual spotlights. The guests 
crowded surreptitiously closer. A 
sudden hush descended upon the 
clearing. The dance, play or what- 
ever it was, was about to begin. 

IV 

M arnsworth could not 
move — his curiosity had 

transfixed him. He could not un- 
derstand what was happening. 
But if his mind could make no 
sense out of what was going on he 
found his body reacting to a stim- 
ulus he could not identify. 

The performance seemed to be 
a subtle blend of mime and dance 
and drama juxtaposed, moving 
smoothly and intricately from one 
form to the other as the needs of 
the composer were answered. The 
music was predominantly percus- 
sive — the delicate tremor of some- 
thing like castanets, muted gongs, 



70 



IF 




tabors and other instruments were 
quite alien to Marnsworth’s ears 
but not to his body — his cells re- 
membered when his conscious 
mind did not. The general effect 
was hypnotic, not upon his mind 
so much as on his body. Although 
he recognized only a word here 
and there — or a gesture or two — 
he became alarmed at the way his 
pulse throbbed and his forehead 
ached. The moving figures on 
the mosaic dazzled and blinded 
him and yet he could not turn 
away for fear of missing something 
profound. 

He had no idea of how long the 
performance lasted — time ceased 
to have any dominion for the du- 
ration of the play. But inevitably 
the dancers/actors brought the 
drama/dance to a close. They per- 
formed a rich and intricate coda 
and then moved quietly back to 
their original positions. A final 
murmur came from the hidden 
drums, muted and in rapport with 
the night, and then the spotlights 
dimmed. Silence and darkness 
rushed down upon the clearing. 
For perhaps a full minute nobody 
seemed to breathe. Then the play- 
ers shed their masks and robes and 
moved back among the guests. 

The lights returned gradually 
and, even when they were fully on, 
were somewhat duller than before. 
Marnsworth found that he could 
not easily dispel the feelings that 
the play had conjured up within 
his unsuspecting body. His eyes 



searched for Rachel and found 
her the center of an admiring 
number of guests. Her eyes flashed 
triumphantly as they met his. She 
smiled and waved, turned to say 
something to her husband. 

Childers stepped toward him. 
His eyes were bright with happi- 
ness. 

“Well, did you like it? Rachel 
excelled herself tonight.” 

And he knew then why he had 
followed the movements of one of 
the dancers with such intensity. 

“She’s been working on that 
performance for months. Ages of 
rehearsals and tonight — a tri- 
umph.” 

“But I didn’t understand a word 
of it,” the spaceman protested. 

Childers smiled graciously. 

“You weren’t supposed to. 
Latin is a rather dead language 
even at home — but it has a certain 
beauty of its own, don’t you agree? 
Of course the Service finds little 
enough use for it.” 

He had not meant the words to 
cut so deep, but Marnsworth bled. 

“Do you delight in your obscur- 
ity?” 

“No. We try to be simple, to be 
close to life, to what is real. Why 
must the simple always seem com- 
plex to an outsider?” 

L ATER there was a ceremony. 

The guests collected in the 
main room of Murray’s house at a 
great wooden table. When they 
had arranged themselves in a rev-

erent group around this symbol — 
with Mamsworth well to the rear 
the better to watch the ritual — 
Murray Wiseman came in. In his 
arms were several dozen books, 
odd little printed volumes such as 
the spaceman had only seen pre- 
viously in out-of-the-way muse- 
ums. Murray deposited the books 
carefully on the table and stepped 
back. 

“Well, there’s the latest batch,’’ 
he announced. “Hot off the little 
old press. Now don’t stand there 
all night — step forward.’’ 

And they did. Each in turn 
went forward and accepted, with 
thanks, one of the slim volumes. 
Childers’ turn came around. He 
brought back a book and handled 
it with delight. 

“Some poems of Robert 
Graves,” he explained. 

Mamsworth said nothing. 

Presently he made himself ask, 
“Does this little ritual round out 
every party?” 

He was unable to conceal his 
contempt for useless labor. 

“Whenever he’s launching a 
new publication — yes. It takes him 
about three months for him to re- 
search and transcribe a new tape, 
then set up the type and run off 
each page.” 

“You mean he prints everything 
by hand?” 

“Of course.” 

“The man’s a fool.” 

Childers said nothing, only 
smiled his enigmatic smile and 



fondled the small book in his 
hands. 

A solitary volume was left on 
the great wooden table. Murray 
leaned over, picked it up with a 
flourish. He held it briefly aloft. 

“And this one’s mine.” 

An undercurrent of laughter 
moved through the room and the 
guests began to disband. The ma- 
jor business of the evening was 
over and Mamsworth could de- 
tect the movements of people won- 
dering whether or not it was late 
enough to go home — or if there 
might be time for one more drink. 

H E WAS intolerably weary on 
the way back to Childers’ 
house. The thirty-two-hour Hy- 
drian day, coupled with overindul- 
gence in native food and wine, had 
combined to intensify his exhaus- 
tion. But once they were home 
Rachel brewed some of the rich 
dark coffee he had come to associ- 
ate with the island — strange, but 
he could no longer think that it be- 
longed to the Service — and this 
helped to revive his sagging spirits. 

The two men sat apart in the 
main living room, sipping their 
warm drinks while Rachel plucked 
out haunting, timeless melodies on 
a strange stringed instrument in 
her lap. The instrument was broad 
and long and she had to sit cross- 
legged on the floor to play it. The 
fragmented music that leapt from 
her fingertips was unbearably an- 
cient. The unfamiliar tonal idiom 



72 



IF 




—could it have been Asian? — 
moved restlessly through Marns- 
worth’s cluttered mind. 

They sat thus for some time, un- 
til the stark, uncompromising mu- 
sic stopped and Marnsworth saw 
that Childers’ wife had fallen 
asleep over her instrument. Her 
head was resting against the side 
of the divan and her dark hair was 
undone and pooling around her 
shoulders. 

Childers apologized for the late- 
ness of the affair and, with a gen- 
tleness Marnsworth envied, picked 
up his wife and cradled her in his 
arms. She did not stir. 

“I guess it’s time we were all 
asleep,” Childers said. He brushed 
his bushy cheek against Rachel’s 
jet-black hair. “Take any room 
you like.” 

He watched them move out 
through one of the doorless exits 
and when he walked through the 
house to find a place to sleep he 
found that a heavy weight had at- 
tached itself to his already over- 
burdened heart. 

He discovered a small, sparsely 
furnished room with a bed in one 
corner. He sank down gratefully, 
conscious of the spartan nature of 
the upholstery, but too tired to 
care. He felt warm; he had no need 
for blankets. He waved his hands 
across the nearby wall until it 
passed over the eye that controlled 
the light; the room dimmed down 
to an agreeable twilight, and final- 
ly, over a period of perhaps several 



minutes, into darkness. 

His thoughts tumbled over and 
over in his muddled head, like 
playful kittens with sharp claws, 
and strange music echoed around 
the ghostly caverns of his soul. 

He thought of Rachel, and all 
the other women he had known, 
and found that sleep was elusive 
for a time; and when he did stum- 
ble eventually into that realm, he 
dreamed a nightmare . 

U NDER him the world turned, 
breathed and pulsed with life. 
He lay spreadeagled and naked 
across it, held there by some pow- 
erful and unseen force — it was like 
being fastened to a medieval rack 
and being unable to see his tor- 
menters. Overhead the stars 
wheeled crazily, burning whorls of 
light knitted together by shuttling 
steel shapes. 

He felt a little like Gulliver on 
the island of Lilliput, bound by in- 
visible threads to the soil beneath 
him. 

And he was afraid. His body 
ached. The ache corkscrewed into 
agony. The force that held him 
inert seemed also to be pulling him 
down, a little at a time — down into 
the moist and suffocating surface 
of the world. He couldn’t move 
and faces danced before him, 
vague and unsmiling and riddled 
with age. The world turned again 
and again and again and the rack 
tightened until it seemed that his 
body would fly apart. The angry 



SPACEMAN 



73 




soil rose up all around him and 
crept over his limbs — it wanted to 
bury him. His skin began to 
slough away from his features and 
he knew that a ragged, ancient 
face stared up at the whirling uni- 
verse, where fireflies of starlight 
buzzed and the little steel shapes 
knitted busily. 

He opened his mouth to cry out. 

And awoke. 

And found that he could not 
move. 

The lost echo of a scream rever- 
berated around the narrow room. 

Hrs breathing was coarse and 
irregular. His body weighed a ton 
or more. The residue of a night- 
mare was reluctant to let go of 
him. For a moment he wondered 
if he were really awake. 

Why couldn’t he move? 

There was a terrible ache in his 
head. His face seemed to be on 
fire. A hundred tiny needles were 
burrowing through his sinus cavi- 
ties. He could hardly breathe, let 
alone cry out, and the terrifying 
stigmata of his dream still glared 
at him out of the darkness. 

His body felt dirty and uncom- 
fortable from the burden of his 
sweat. 

Gradually his fear subsided. He 
managed to roll over onto his side 
down to the hard wooden floor. 
He felt drugged — probably from 
too much native wine — and his 
movements were sluggish. But 
somehow he groped his way awk- 
wardly through the dark and back 



into the main room, where a soft 
night light still glowed. 

He found his suit and managed 
to crawl back into it. The effort 
seemed to take hours. His fingers 
scrabbled anxiously at his belt 
controls. Once they were function- 
ing he leaned back against a chair 
and waited for some comfort to re- 
turn. 

The tiny mechanisms whirred 
audibly in the unnatural silence, 
busily whisking impurities out of 
his air. He sat still for some time — 
until he could breathe with some 
freedom — and then made his way 
back to his room. He sank back 
onto the bed exhausted. 

His suit soothed and protected 
him and made him comfortable 
and he was soon fast asleep. His 
head stopped -throbbing and the 
ache in his sinuses eased a little. 
But his dreams were vague and 
uncertain, although they lacked 
the virulence of the earlier night- 
mare. 

H E AWOKE with a hangover. 

His body was cool and com- 
fortable but inside he felt foul. Too 
much incautious wining and din- 
ing had had their way — he really 
should have been more careful. 
His mouth was dry and felt like 
the bottom of a_bird cage. He had 
to get a drink somewhere and 
something to get rid of the hang- 
over. 

There was nobody about when 
he walked into the main room. He 



74 



IF 




opened the front door and strode 
to where his skiff was pafked. He 
opened the locker and fumbled for 
some tablets that would alleviate 
the worst effects of the wine. He 
could not swallow them dry, so he 
wandered around the grounds un- 
til he found a small natural foun- 
tain around one side of the house. 
He cupped one hand under a fau- 
cet and washed down the pills with 
several ounces of fresh water. 

The liquid stung his throat, it 
was so cold. But the flavor was not 
unpleasant and in a few moments 
he felt the veil of fog begin to lift 
from his mind. Yet there was a 
stain that refused to shift and 
made him feel a stranger to him- 
self. 

Too much wine, jar too much. I 
must be more careful. That was a 
damned foolish thing to do . 

He switched on his sensors and 
listened to the quiet. The morning 
was calm. Only the distant patient 
passage of the river moving over 
some rocks was audible. He ex- 
tended a hand and saw a drifting 
film of fine rain collect upon it. 
Strange, he had not noticed it was 
raining until now. How had he 
come to accept something so un- 
familiar? 

Behind some nearby trees he 
spied a small stream running down 
toward the river. Farther on he 
could see where it formed a wide, 
shaded pool before going again 
about its business. Some fresh 
sounds came from this direction. 



They could have been human 
voices. Marnsworth ambled over 
in that direction to see who it was. 

The pool was wide, deep and 
dark where the wan sunlight had 
not yet penetrated. Somebody was 
splashing happily in the chill wa- 
ters. He saw an upraised arm set- 
tle back into the pool and draw the 
swimmer towards him. 

Childers’ wife — enjoying her 
own remedy for hangovers, he sur- 
mised. But the spaceman shivered 
at the thought of that icy pool and 
was not tempted. 

He took a step forward to call 
out and then froze, his hands stiff 
at his sides. A sudden enchant- 
ment had settled over the pool. It 
seemed to sweep up from the past 
— from his past — from the un- 
quarried limbo of his youth to a 
time when he, too, had swum with- 
out questions in waters no differ- 
ent from these. Long ago — on a 
world called Earth, when there 
had been time for such pleasures 
and space to accommodate them. 
His ears filled with the tingle of 
forgotten sounds and sights. 

Rachel stood up and waded 
ashore. She stood with her feet 
braced wide apart and raised both 
her hands to her neck and crushed 
the cold pool from out of her long 
dark hair. It raced down the arch 
of her spine and splashed around 
her ankles. Her brown body was 
beautiful in the soft morning sun- 
light and Marnsworth felt a sud- 
den and intense surge of sexual de-

sire — so powerful that it caught 
him unprepared and made him 
shake so much that he had to lean 
against a nearby tree for support. 

She had closed her eyes while 
she swept the water from her hair. 
Now she opened them and looked 
across at him, as though seeing 
him for the first time. And for the 
space of that drawn-out moment 
Marnsworth felt that all his life, 
all of his living, all that he had 
ever been and ever hoped to be, 
was stretched out between them 
like a finely strung wire. The si- 
lence was tangible. 

And then she smiled, and 
flicked her hair with her hands, 
and stepped forward to pick up a 
towel. The violent need that had 
momentarily gripped Marnsworth 
quivered and then dissipated itself 
throughout his body. He opened 
his mouth but found that he could 
not speak. His heart hammered 
and pushed his blood at such a 
pace that it seemed to scour his 
lungs. He could not move or 
speak, for her smile had transfixed 
him. It had been an expression so 
complete in its friendship that he 
wondered how he could ever speak 
to her again. In a moment she had 
seen the clumsy betrayal of his 
face, had divined in that small 
space of time the nature of his de- 
sire and, with her smile, seemed to 
have suggested that, had the mo- 
ment been otherwise, they might 
have lain together and she would 
have taken from him that terrible 



surge of passion. She had under- 
stood. 

She moved about, drying her- 
self, the swing of her broad hips 
casual and unself-conscious. 

“Good morning, Damian,” she 
said, brightly. “Sleep well?” 

He could not answer. Instead he 
looked away and stared into the 
deepest part of the pool, as if the 
shadows of the overhanging trees 
could hide his shame. 

A SUDDEN splash came from 
the other side of the pool. 
Childers’ body broke the water. 
He swam across with slow, power- 
ful strokes and jumped lightly 
ashore. He grabbed for his own 
towel and attacked his streaming 
wet body vigorously. 

“Hope you slept well, Damian.” 
“After — a fashion,” the space- 
man managed. He gestured awk- 
wardly at his survival suit. “I had 
to — you see.” 

They understood. 

Rachel brushed idly at her wet 
hair with her towel. It was sudden- 
ly a vivid blaze of orange, the color 
of the shift he had first seen her in. 

Childers gave her a playful pat 
on the belly. “How is he this morn- 
ing?” 

She smiled mysteriously. 
“Rachel’s having a child, you 
know,” Childers explained. “An- 
other five months and — ” 

But Marnsworth wasn’t listen- 
ing — he had recoiled in horror, 
his eyes fastened on the woman’s 



76 



IF 




abdomen. Of course she was stat- 
uesque but he could see right away 
that the slight bulge at her waist 
was not right. 

He looked like a man who had 
been physically struck. He stum- 
bled a few steps backward. 

“You mean — you mean she’s 
going to have it herself?” 

A cloud passed over his friend’s 
face. Childers put his arm around 
his wife. 

“Does that sound so strange? 
That my wife will have a child, 
from her own womb, and in her 
own time? That’s the way she 
wants it, Damian — and that is the 
way I will be proud to accept my 
son — or daughter, as the case may 
be. You see, we won’t really know 
until the child is bom. Isn’t that 
marvelous? For us there can’t be 
any other way.” 

Marnsworth stared at them. Ex- 
cept for the profound and confi- 
dent glow of intelligence in their 
eyes they looked like two naked 
savages. There was no longer any 
point in maintaining a facade of 
communication. Last night should 
have been a warning. This whole 
trip had been a mistake. 

Without another word he spun 
around and marched blindly back 
toward his skiff. He did not know 
that his eyes were filled with tears 
— for him tears were an unaccus- 
tomed occurence. He no longer 
noticed the rain and he did not 
hear Childers’ wife calling out to 
him. He moved in the grip of a 



mindless fury. There could be 
nothing beyond the final proof of 
this insanity — it was monstrous 
that Childers should allow his wife 
to risk her life giving birth to a 
child in such an un-Controlled 
and dangerous manner. 

He climbed clumsily into the 
skiff and swung shut the canopy. 
But he hesitated before the con- 
trols — they had become a hazy 
blur to him — and that was time 
enough for Childers to catch up 
with him. Rachel ran behind her 
husband, the orange towel trailing 
like a forlorn sail. 

Marnsworth shook his head but 
the haze would not clear. Angrily 
he flicked a toggle. The motor 
hummed into life. 

Beyond the canopy he could see 
Childers’ face upturned and could 
read the despair that was etched 
there. 

“Damian,” he called out. “Da- 
mian — think of us. Think of why 
you came here if you never have 
before. We need somebody to un- 
derstand — somebody to bridge 

the gap—” 

And then they were gone. The 
skiff accelerated sharply skyward. 
It hovered for a moment, recheck- 
ing coordinates, and then shot 
away at a steep angle, allowing 
Marnsworth a last glimpse of the 
people below. 

They, both seemed so small, 
locked together in their madness. 
Rachel’s towel made a dark 
orange stain on the grass. The 



SPACEMAN 



77 




image burned itself deep into his 
memory and he knew that he 
would never be able to erase it 
from his mind. 

Damn you! Damn you . 

T HE skiff moved rapidly away 
from the estate, burrowing 
anxiously through the dense rain 
clouds at maximum acceleration. 
But as fast as it moved it was pur- 
sued by something faster — a 
nameless invisible terror that 
seemed to possess the shape of a 
great bird of prey, vengeful and 
demented. It spread wide its 
dreadful claws and fastened them 
into his skull and began to tear 
away at his gibbering mind. Dark- 
ness engulfed him, a darkness 
where his voice became a whim- 
pering pale thing that could not be 
heard. 

The auto-pilot carried him safe- 
ly back to the Barain, where kind 
hands lifted his weeping, twitching 
body from the small craft and car- 
ried him to a private room on 
board the massive starship. And 
there he was confined with his 
sickness while they fired the en- 
gines for the short passage home. 

And still his terror possessed 
him. A stranger walked the wailing 
corridors of his mind — someone 
alien and yet himself, struggling 
to break free. Sometimes he awoke 
from his tormented dreams and 
struck his fists against the bulk- 
head until they bled, or until oth- 



ers arrived and strapped him back 
into his bed. They could not un- 
derstand that he had only 
screamed defiance at the hostile 
universe outside that was crowding 
to get in. And he dreamed of rivers 
and trees and sunlight and the pal- 
lid women of Earth with their 
mouths agape for orgasm — but 
their minds were divorced in time 
from the simple pleasure of their 
bodies. They were old and yet they 
were young and he hated them for 
it and the angry beast inside him 
struggled to get out and smash 
their smiling faces. He dreamed of 
flesh and steel, darkness and light 
and his small room fogged up like 
the world he remembered as Is- 
land One. The same moist air 
draped itself around him. It was 
like living again in the warm wet 
womb he had never known. He 
was a child of a silver cylinder — 
but his cells remembered. 

And Rachel’s face would some- 
times come smiling through the 
corruption and the terror and he 
would recall her nature and all the 
other things about the island and 
the memory would often make 
him smile in his sleep. Almost he 
began to understand. But it was 
only when his body took over the 
unequal task and remembered 
what it was that he had to remem- 
ber, to survive, that he began to 
hope. But that came later. 

When the physicians on Earth 
had finished with him. After they 
had nursed him and nurtured him 



78 



IF 




and purged the poisons from his To wander lonely and afraid 
system. After they had slain the through the crowded streets, push- 
great ugly bird and removed its ing his way through the bland un- 
talons from his soul and then, con- smiling multitudes of the forever 
vinced that they had done all that young, looking for the miracle of 
they could to help him, released an old and tired face, 
him. And for himself. •

H E DIDN’T have enough 
change to drop into the 
baby-sitter. Sam Burse patted the 
chrome front of the robot and 
backed away from the front 
door. 

“I’ll get my charge tag,’’ he 
said. “Come on in anyway.’’ 

“You can pay us when you get 
home,” said the box-shaped, 
man-size robot. “You’re one of 
our good customers, Mr. Samuels. 
You needn’t pay in advance. We 
trust you.” 

“You’ve got my name turned 
around.” Sam crossed the living- 
room pit and took his coat from 
a sofa chair. It’s Samuel 
Burse.” 

The robot said, “We’ve been 
doing that lately.” He rolled over 
the threshold and followed Sam 
across the carpeting. “Your kids 
are named Danny and Nancy, 
though, aren’t they?” 

“That’s right.” 

“We’re not completely absent- 
minded then,” said the robot. He 
collided with a near-marble cof- 
fee table and a vase of straw 
flowers fell off. “Oops.” 

A small arm extended out of 
the shiny box and scooped up the 
fallen flowers. 

Sam said, “The kids are al- 
ready in their sleeping room, 
watching the wall. You can go 
look in on them and introduce 
yourself.” 

The robot arranged the flowers 
carefully, then rolled to one of 



the framed oblong view-windows. 

“That’s really lovely. I always 
enjoy sitting jobs here in Build 
Up Six, because of the Pacific 
Ocean. I’m programed to have 
esthetic responses. It’s a big help 
in handling kids.” 

Sam put on his coat and felt in 
its pouches. “This was all the 
ocean under here before they filled 
it in back in, back in nineteen 
eighty-nine.” 

The robot rolled again toward 
the coffee table. 

“We notice you have a bowl of 
carrots here next to your flowers. 
Is that something new in the way 
of decor?” 

“No, it’s my work.” Sam 
found the charge tag and tossed 
it to the robot. “We’ll be quite 
late. So charge us the maximum 
now.” 

The polished robot put the 
dogtag into a slot in his left side. 

“Fifteen, even. Right you are.” 
He returned the charge tag. 
“You’re in the produce busi- 
ness?” 

“No, I’m with a company 
called Conglomerated Food 
West and I’m in charge of new 
names.” 

Sam was not particularly satis- 
fied at CFW. He’d been thinking 
of looking, maybe after the 
first of the year, for something 
new. 

“Isn’t carrots a good enough 
name any more?” 

“People don’t seem to like to 



SWAP 



81 




buy just carrots all the time,” said 
Sam. “Even though carrots, be- 
ing a real vegetable, are a prestige 
item. So we have to come up 
with new ways to package them, 
to serve them. Each new use 
calls for a new name.” 

The robot asked, “What was it 
you wanted us to do?” 

“Look in on the kids and in- 
troduce yourself.” 

“Oh, yes, I remember now.” 
The baby-sitter was at the door- 
way when Sam’s tall pretty wife 
came in. “Good evening, Mrs. 
Anita.” 

After the robot had rolled 
down the ramp into the children’s 
room area, Anita said, “We 
ought to think, Sam, about deal- 
ing with a new company. These 
people have sent us too many for- 
getful machines lately.” 

“We could stay home tonight,” 
He’d wanted to suggest that, ear- 
lier, while Anita had been dialing 
dinner. 

She touched absently at her 
long dark hair, frowning. 

“Not on our swap night. No.” 
She walked nearer to him. 
“You’re not enjoying this much 
any more, are you?” 

Sam hesitated. This didn’t seem 
like the best time, with a strange 
machine in the house, to get into 
a discussion. 

“No, it’s okay. You like it. It’s 
fun.” 

“After a long week with all 
your dumb vegetables you should 



welcome Friday,” she told him. 

“Yes, thank God it’s Friday.” 
He turned to watch the same 
stretch of dark ocean the robot 
had admired. 

“Well,” said his wife, “I still 
enjoy our swap nights. I might 
even say I look forward to them. 
But if you don’t — ” 

“Nobody’s complaining,” said 
Sam. “We’ll go ahead.” 
“Grudgingly,” she said. “Oh, 
darn, Sam, I finally thought we 
found a shared activity we both 
enjoyed. Now, after three or four 
months of it you’re gloomy.” 

Sam faced his slim, pretty wife 
and smiled. 

“I’m not gloomy.” 

“You’re smiling grudgingly.” 
From the children’s bedroom 
double laughter came. 

“They both like him” said 
Sam. 

“They’re sympathetic toward 
incompetence,” said Anita. 
“Probably inherited.” 

Sam nodded and said, “Let’s 
go- 

In the children’s area the robot 
was calling the children by th<e 
wrong names and their laughter 
continued. 

T HE swap unit was housed at 
the Taplins’ place. Their 
house was also on Build Up Six, 
five blocks from the Burses’. You 
could drive there without bother- 
ing to hook onto the speedways. 
Sam drove because Anita only 



82 



IF 




had a slot license. This sector of 
Greater Los Angeles was so se- 
cure and well patrolled you could 
even walk on the sidewalks if you 
cared to. 

Don Tapplin was seated in 
front of the swap unit when they 
got there. He was a small, round- 
shouldered thirty-two-year-old 
and he was reading a paper tape 
that was unreeling out of Spinner 
# 146-92. 

“Hi, Sam. Hi, Anita,” Don 
said over his shoulder. “That’s 
interesting.” 

Maggie Taplin was sitting in a 
vaguely yogi position on the ther- 
mal rug, her slim back touching 
the view window. 

“What is?” 

“It says there are now two 
hundred participants in our swap 
group.” He tore the tape free of 
the machine and waved it in the 
air as though drying it. “Mean- 
ing a hundred couples. So what 
are the possibilities, Sam?” 

Sam answered, “Considerable, 
I’d say.” 

“Sam saves his brain for think- 
ing about vegetables,” said 
Anita. She went and stood near 
the machine. “He’s got no time 
for mathematics.” 

Don Taplin handed her the 
strip of paper. He put his palms 
on the top of Spinner # 146-92. 

“Well, whatever the exact 
number of different combina- 
tions is, it sounds like more fun. 
I’ve gotten the same Chinese girl 



over in Build Up Nine twice in 
the last month.” 

“Always belittling,” said the 
swap unit. It had a round, 
mouth-sized speaker grid on its 
top. Next to the bank of dials. 

Don flung up his hands. 

“I didn’t know it could talk.” 

“What do you think the 
speaker grid is for?” asked his 
wife. 

“Does he talk to you?” asked 
Don. 

“Oh, sure,” said Maggie. 
“When you’re at the office he re- 
cites love poems to me.” 

Spinner # 146-92 said, “Once 
in a while I like to speak up. Hel- 
lo, everybody.” 

“What kind of love poems?” 

“Your wife is spoofing you, 
Don,” said the swap unit. 

“What do you recite if it isn’t 
love poetry?” 

“Nothing, Don,” said Maggie. 
“Nothing.” 

“I joined this swap group be- 
cause we get programed promis- 
cuity,” said Don. “Fun and in 
the open. Nothing secretive. Now 
I find you’ve been having some 
kind of strange relationship with 
this machine.” 

“Is everybody in our unit pres- 
ent now?” asked the machine. 

“Yes,” said Maggie, rishing. 
“The Verbecks are sick tonight. 
Flu.” 

“I think I have a touch of that 
myself,” said the machine. “Say, 
Mr. Burse, would you feel down 



SWAP

behind me and see if I’m all flush 
around my synchronizing de- 
vice.” 

“Wait,” said Sam. “Are you 
on the blink or what? Don, 
% where’s the manual for this 
thing?” 

“Look, it’s almost time to start 
tne spin,” said Don. “If we get 

off schedule we might lose our 
turn. I’m anxious to see what 
some of the new recruits are 
like.” 

“I’m fit as a fiddle,” said the 
spinner. “Now each of you must 
drop a name card into my left 
side, being sure to include absent 
cards for the Verbecks. Then fol- 
low with the standard release 
card, which absolves the Greater 
Los Angeles Mate-Swapping Co- 
op System of any liability or re- 
sponsibility in case of mismatch- 
ing, physical injury or — heaven 
forbid it should happen in this 
day and age — infectious dis- 
ease.” 

“We ought to check the repair 
manual,” said Sam. He consid- 
ered suggesting they call off to- 
night’s session, decided not to 
mention it. 

Anita stepped around him, 
took the proper cards from the 
grill basket on the table next to 
the swap unit. She inserted them 
in the machine. 

“There.” 

Don went next, then Maggie. 
And, last, Sam. 

A small green plastic cone on 



top of the machine flared with 
light and the machine gave a 
ratcheting sound. 

“Round and roun she goes 
and where she stops nobody 
knows.” 

“I liked things better when he 
didn’t talk,” said Anita. 

In succession, clockwise, 
the dials began to spin. A plume 
of sooty smoke rose from some 
place within Spinner # 146-92. 

“We ought to call the damn 
GLA swap people,” suggested 
Sam. 

“Relax,” said his wife. 

“Bingo,” said the machine. A 
white card sprang from a big 
square hole in its front. “Mrs. 
Anita Burse, there’s your swap 
mate for tonight. You’re to wait 
back at your home until he ar- 
rives.” 

Anita caught the card off the 
rug. 

“What an interesting name.” 

“Who?” asked Sam. 

Anita put the card face down 
on her palm. “Remember the 
rules. We don’t talk about it until 
afterward.” 

A card for Don came out next. 
He looked at it, then made a fist 
around the card. 

“I should have taken out the 
manual.” 

“The Chinese girl again?” said 
Maggie. “Actually he’s very fond 
of her. I suspect he’s probably 
tried to tamper with the machine 
so he can get her every time.”

IF 




“I haven’t. There’d be no sense 
participating in this swap group 
if we didn’t all play fair. That’s 
the real fun of a wide-scale sys- 
tem like this. We have access to 
two hundred carefully screened 
people from all of the better sec- 
tors of Greater Los Angeles. 
Much more fun than the simple 
old-fashioned neighborhood 
mate-swapping. Some primitive 
thing where you all throw keys 
in a ring. This is technological.” 

Maggie had her card by this 
time. 

“I’m to stay home tonight, 
too.” 

“Well, folks, bon voyage,” 
said Spinner # 146-92. 

“What about Sam?” asked his 
wife. 

“Who?” 

“Sam. Him.” 

She tapped her husband with 
the hand that didn’t hold the 
card. 

“Oh, yes. Oh, yes.” The swap 
unit made a grunting sound and 
its ratcheting grew harsher. 
“There, it’s coming along now. 
There.” A large pale blue punch 
card snapped into the air, spun 
like a paddle wheel down to the 
rug. “Also this for you.” 

A spinning slip of lined yellow 
paper followed. 

Sam took up the two pieces of 
paper. 

“What’s this all? I’m supposed 
to get a card with a name, ad- 
dress and instructions.” 



“You can’t beat us for infinite 
variety,” said the machine. “We 
don’t like to cloy the appetities 
we feed.” 

The yellow slip had 107 scrawl- 
ed on it in pencil. The card was a 
preprogram for a speedway cab. 

“What? I give this speedway 
route to a cab and go to this ad- 
dress to meet my swap for to- 
night?” 

“Must be,” said Don. “That 
sounds like real fun. Want to trade 
with me, Sam?” 

“Against the rules,” put in the 
machine. “I’d have to report any- 
thing like that.” 

“Let’s,” said Anita, “get on 
with this. Come on, Sam. Drop 
me at the house and then drive 
yourself to a cab station.” 

“Maybe we ought — ” Sam be- 
gan, then shook his head. 
“Okay.” 

“Have fun,” called Don as 
they left. 

T HE automatic cab detached 
itself from the speedway and 
headed down an off-ramp, its 
electric motor clicking on. Sam 
narrowed his eyes, his face close 
to the window. 

“Where exactly are we?” 

“Right where your trip slip 
ordered,” replied the car. It 
rolled onto a pot-holed street and 
stopped next to a canal. “Venice, 
California. This is your stop.” 

“The Venice sector?” Sam had 
his hand on the door release. 



SWAP 



85 




It didn’t seem likely anyone in 
this part of Greater Los Angeles 
would belong to this swap plan. 

“That’ll be five dollars.’’ 

“Charge it to my cab card. The 
number is 59/92/12622/6. Ex- 
cept — ’’ 

“You must disembark now,’’ 
the cab told him. “I’m logged to 
pick up a fare down in Man- 
hattan Beach.’’ 

“Maybe you ought to just take 
me back.’’ 

The swap group prospectus had 
said nothing about drawing on the 
ghetto sectors. 

“I’d like to but it’s not up to 
me, sir. I’m already slotted for 
Manhattan Beach. You’ll have to 
get out of the cab now or I’m 
obliged to eject you.” 

“No need,” said Sam. “I’ll go 
scout another cab.” 

The cab said, “Nice meeting 
you — ” and drove off quietly. 

Sam glanced at the slip of 
paper in his hand, then looked 
down the street. He saw low 
houses, old and faced with peach- 
colored stucco. Beyond them was 
a scatter of dusky brick ware- 
houses. Sam walked toward a 
street lamp at the far corner. 
Mist was thickening around him, 
fuzzy and cold. 

There was a 107 on this block, 
a stucco and red tile cottage with 
wooden shutters and lighted 
windows glowing warm. He hes- 
itated, stopped on the cracked 
flagstones and wild grass front- 



ing the place. Well, since he was 
here, he’d try it. He went up to 
the door and knocked below the 
gilt 107. 

“God bless you, whoever you 
are,” said the bent black man 
who opened the door. “What- 
ever brings you to my door on 
this dismal night, I expect the 
good lord had a hand in it.” 

“I—” said Sam. “Well, I 
don’t suppose you’ve heard of 
the Greater Los Angeles Mate- 
Swapping Co-op System?” 

The man sent two fingers up 
toward his eyes, which were 
masked by wrap-around green 
glass. 

“Oh, yes, I’ve heard of them, 
sir.” 

“You’re not — that is, nobody 
in this area is participating?” 

The black man laughed. 
“Nobody lives in this old house 
but me,- sir. Only me. Blind Frank 
Holes. No, it’s not likely anyone 
around here would belong to 
something as fancy as the Greater 
Los Angeles Mate-Swapping Co- 
op System.” He made a groping 
reach for Sam’s hand. “I tell you, 
though, I bet I know what hap- 
pened. Listen, I’ve got to trot over 
to my place of business. You give 
me a helping hand and I’ll give 
you the benefit of what I think.” 
“Well, okay.” 

“Just excuse me a second. I’ve 
got to turn off a few things in my 

old house.” In less than three min- 
utes Blind Frank stepped out on 



86 



IF 




his narrow cement porch, closed 
his door. He took a good grip on 
Sam’s arm. “We only got to get 
down to one-o-one at the corner, 
sir.” 

“Sure,” said Sam. “So what’s 
your theory?” 

“Well, sir, I’ve heard this swap 
outfit of yours uses second-hand, 
second-rate equipment. I hear 
those routing machines make lots 
of mistakes but the company hush- 
es all that up.” 

“Sounds doubtful.” 

“Still, you’re here and not some- 
place else.” They were at the door 
to a warehouse. “Would you help 
out and put my key in the padlock, 
sir? This fog makes my poor fin- 
gers stiff. Of course, the good 
Lord, he’s got his reasons for mak- 
ing me blind and crippled.” 

Sam got the metal door open 
and gave it an inward shove. 

“I’ll go get to a cab stand now. 
Good night.” 

Blind Frank kept a hand on 
Sam. “Would you guide me to my 
workbench? Oh, you better turn on 
the lights for yourself. I don’t need 
them but you will. Switch right in- 
side on your left, sir.” 

Sam stepped inside and found 
the switch. Six overhead light 
strips, pale yellow and coated with 
dust flared on. The domed, cold 
room was full, cluttered and 
jammed with old robots, androids, 
servomechanisms, automatic chefs, 
soft-drink dispensers. 

“I’m in the electronics busi- 



ness,” explained Blind Frank. 
Even though the good Lord took 
away my sight and bitched up my 
hands, I still do repairs.” 

Sam said, “That your work- 
bench under the windows?” 

“Yes, right next to the electric 
evangelist.” 

“Is that a street-corner preach- 
ing unit?” 

“Yes, sir,” said Blind Frank. 
“I bought him in an auction after 
a food riot in the Glendale sector. 
Somebody swiped his right arm. 
Ripped it clean off. So they de- 
cided the figure wasn’t worth much 
without his blessing arm. Me, I fig- 
ured I can fix him up with parts of 
a taco chef I got last month down 
in Tijuana. Govenment was con- 
trolling some students and they 
messed up a whole block of ethnic 
restaurants.” 

“In times like these,” said the 
blond humanoid evangelist, “in 
times like these we hear a good 
deal of talk about loss of faith. 
Now I’m here to say we all better 
have faith because there’s judgment 
coming. Judgment and hellsmoke, 
not to mention earthquakes, mud- 
slides and the usual brush fires. 
Everybody who wants to get salva 1 
tion, raise your right hand. Just 
like me.” 

“That’s why he’s going to need 
a new arm,” said Blind Frank. 

The robot evangelist was waving 
the empty sleeve of a smudged 
white suit. 

“Best arm I can give him,” said

Blind Frank, “has got a spatula 
built into it.” 

Sam said, “I’ll be leaving.” 

A new voice broke in. 

“You got one for us? Is that 
why — you know — you called?” 

A young girl was leaning in the 
open doorway. She was twenty- 
two, small and frail, wearing a 
man’s one-piece suit. 

“I think maybe yes.” 

Blind Frank snapped off his 
glasses and picked up a heavy 
wrench from the workbench. 

Sam said, “Wait, now.” 

The girl adjusted her floppy hat 
and came into the warehouse, clos- 
ing the door gently. She had small 
sharp breasts and almost white 
blond hair. 

“He looks, you know, usable.” 
“He surely does,” said Blind 
Frank. 

Sam watched the frail girl ap- 
proach. 

“You’re signed up with the 
Greater Los Angeles Mate — ” 
“Curtain time is less than an 
hour away,” she cut in. “Lonn’s, 
you know, growing really anxious. 
We’re sold out. If you hadn’t 
called I would have had to use the 
street corners again.” She focused 
on Sam. “Down here, mister, 
everything’s a swap. But we don’t 
always swap mates for mates.” 

“I’m going to leave now,” Sam 
told them. “Whatever it is you’re 
up to, forget it. v 

“This here is Miss Mary Glid- 
den,” explained Blind Frank. 



“She’s in partnership with Lonn 
DeSoto. You surely have heard of 
him.” 

Sam frowned as the girl reached 
out and touched him. 

“The name, yes,” Sam said. 
“I’ve Jieard it but I’m not cer- 
tain—” 

“Those fires of hell,” said the 
robot preacher, “are going to burn 
through all eternity, friends. You 
know what eternity is? It’s a long 
time—” 

“The police,” said Sam, remem- 
bering, “are looking for Lonn De- 
Soto. He’s the guy who puts on 
plays where people are supposed to 
get killed.” 

“Yes, Lonn is, you know, the 
founder and director of the Thea- 
ter of Murder,” said Mary Glid- 
den. She rubbed slender fingers 
under Sam’s chin. “And you are 
going to be, you know, tonight’s 
star.” 

Blind Frank swung out suddenly 
with the wrench and knocked Sam 
to the floor. 

“ . are quite meaningless. The 
whole Western tradition of theater 
has now and for all time dead- 
ended,” the girl’s voice was telling 
Sam. “Words, as either symbols or 
modes of communication, are 
passe'. You must live for action, 
mister, or you wouldn’t be here. 
All that fits these, you know, bru- 
tal times we live in is a brutal thea- 
ter. We’ve been working toward a 
more physical form of drama for

a decade now and Lonn, the mes- 
siah of completely realized brutal 
theater, has had the courage to ex- 
plore the extremes. The, you know, 
ultimate performance. I’m happy 
to be a part of his Theater of Mur- 
der.” She had a pistol in her slen- 
der hand and she jabbed it at his 
stomach. “So now do you under- 
stand your part?” 

Sam said, “I’m sorry. I must 
have been unconscious.” 

The pistol barrel dug into him 
again. “Well, pay attention, won’t 
you? You have no — you know — 
feel for show business. Lonn says 
we’ve got a hundred people down 
there in the audience tonight. 
There’s even a vidtape talent 
scout.” 

Sam breathed in air through his 
mouth. He widened his eyes and 
tried to see clearly again. Yellow 
rings danced in the thick air of the 
little dressing room he was in. He 
blinked and the rings faded. There 
were clothes racks against two of 
the walls. Sam noticed a small 
window. 

“You really mean to kill me?” 
“I’m not famous for, you know, 
kidding around,” said Mary Glid- 
den. 

Sam found he was in his under-* 
wear. “My clothes — ” 

“You must really be dizzier than 
you look.” She scratched at her 
sharp left breast with the barrel of 
the hand gun. “I already explained 
you are to play Indian — Lonn’s 
getting into his Kit Carson cos- 



tume. Hurry up and, you know, 
get your costume on.” 

Sam noticed a feathered head- 
ress and a blanket at his feet. He 
and Mary Glidden were alone in 
the tiny room. 

She said, “Curtain going up in 
ten minutes.” 

Sam picked up the feathers and 
the blanket. “This makes you some 
kind of accessory.” 

“We’re beyond — you know — 
silly considerations like that by 
now.” 

Sam lunged with the blanket and 
dropped it over the girl. The pistol 
fired through it but missed him. 
He swung a hard fist at where he 
guess Mary’s chin was. She sighed 
and sank down. His clothes were 
sprawled in a wing chair. He 
grabbed most of them and went to 
the window. He tugged it open and 
hopped to the ledge. He hesitated, 
then jumped. 

T HE phone screen in the bat- 
tered booth throbbed green 
and a throaty voice with a faint 
Irish accent said, “That number is 
not at the moment in service.” 

Sam said, “Okay, okay.” 

He clicked off and stayed in the 
booth. He had tried to call his 
wife, Anita. He wanted to reach 
her. She was probably okay but he 
worried. Even if she turned out to 
be all right, this business had to 
stop. Something could go wrong 
again — anything — and hurt Anita. 
He would have to talk to her, even

if it meant an argument. Sighing, 
he dialed the police and waited. 

A high keening grew outside, a 
red whooping. Sam looked out. 
A mobile police station, two white 
glass balls on its front cab, was 
coming up the street. Sam stepped 
out. 

“Hands up,” ordered a voice 
from the side of the long green 
trailer. “Don’t move and don’t say 
anything incriminating.” 

Sam eased closer to the mobile 
station. 

“Officer—” 

“Hands up.” 

Sam put up his hands. 

“I was going to report some- 
thing to the police — ” 

A door in the green trailer slid 
open and a tall man leaned out. 

“Step inside,” he said. “I’m 
Sergeant Plumb, Venice Division, 
Greater Los Angeles Police.” 

“I’m Sam Burse. Samuel L. 
Burse, from Build Up Six.” 

He climbed up a three-rung iron 
ladder and into a gray metal room. 

Sergeant Plumb got behind a 
synthetic wood desk and pulled an 
audiotypewriter in front of him. 

“Let’s have your statement. 
First — why are you lurking around 
in such an unkempt manner and 
without any shoes?” 

“We’re members of the GLA 
Mate Swapping Co-op System,” 
said Sam. “Our local spinner is 
sort of on the fritz. It sent me to 
the wrong place.” 

“Yeah, we get reports on slip-

ups like that from time to time. Is 
that going to be your story?” 

“Yes, part of it. I ran into a fel- 
low named Blind Frank Holes and 
he turned me over to Lonn De- 
Soto, who was going to kill me.” 
Plumb activated his typewriter. 
“You’re an associate of Lonn 
DeSoto, are you?” 

“No, more a victim. He was go- 
ing to kill me as part of his show. I 
can show you where they planned 
to put on one of their murder 
plays.” 

“What I’d like is a statement on

“Aren’t you interested in Lonn 
DeSoto? He’s murdering people.” 
“Around here we pick up lots of 
people who claim they can give us 
tips,” said the sergeant. 

In a dark corner of the room an 
old man in a black suit rattled to 
his feet, yawned. 

“Has he confessed yet, sarge?” 
“No, Judge Littony.” 

The judge stepped into the light. 
“What does R&I say about his 
fingerprints, sarge?” 

Sergeant Plumb grabbed Sam’s 
hand, shoved it into a slot in the 
desk. A red light flashed next to 
the slot and a gray card popped 
out. 

Plumb looked at it. 

“This really is Burse, Samuel L. 
of Build Up Six. No criminal rec- 
ord. B-plus credit rating. Want us 
to hold him?” 

Judge Littony shook his head. 



“With a credit rating like his? Get 
a statement from him and let him 
off at the next cab stand.” 

The judge returned to the shad- 
ows. 

S AM’s house was quiet. The liv- 
ing room area was faintly lit. 
Sam ran from the cab to his front 
door, opened it. Three steps inside 
he stopped. 

Anita, in a pale blue night robe, 
was sitting on a near-leather chair. 
A cup of still steaming cocoa 
rested on her bare knee. 

“I decided to wait up,” she said. 
“Nearly dawn, isn’t it?” 

Sam came further into his 
house. “Must be,” he said. “How 
are you?” 

She smiled. 

“Fine,” she said. “He left a 
couple of hours ago. A pleasant 
man, though a bit plump, from the 
Beverly Glen sector. I enjoyed my- 
self.” 

Sam watched her, then wan- 
dered to the view window. The sky 
was paling to gray over the quiet 
ocean. He thought again of what 
he had planned to say. 

“That’s good,” he said finally. 

A single gull seemed asleep at 
the water’s edge. 

“What about you?” asked 
Anita. 

The gull arose and went walking 
away, skirting the sea. Sam kept 
watching it. 

“Oh, I can’t complain,’’ he 
said. •

T HESE are my notes on a very 
sticky business. They are not 
in the form of a protest, which 
would be useless. Holly is gone 
and the Shelni will all be gone in 
the next day or two, if indeed there 
are any of them left now. This is 
for the record only. 

Holly Harkel and myself, Vin- 
cent Vanhoosier, received funds 
and permission to record the lore 
of the Shelni through the interces- 
sion of that old correlator, John 
Holmberg. This was unexpected. 
All lorists have counted John as 
their worst enemy. 

I remember his words. 

After all , we have been at great 
expense to record the minutiae of 
pig grunts and the sound of earth- 
worms and we have records of 
squeakings of hundreds of species 
of orbital rodents. We have verita- 
ble libraries of the song and cackle 
of all birds and pseudo-ornins. 
Well, let us add the Shelni to our 
list. / do not believe that their 
thumping on tree roots or blowing 
into jug gourds is music. I do not 
believe that their singsong is speech 
any more than the squeaking of 
doors is speech. We have recorded, 
by the way, the sound of more than 
thirty thousand squeaking doors. 
And we have had worse. Let us 
have the Shelni, then, if your hearts 
are set on it. You'll have to hurry. 
They're about gone. 

And let me say in all compas- 
sion that anyone who looks like 
Miss Holly Harkel deserves her 



heart's desire. That is no more 
than simple justice. Besides, the 
bill will be footed by the Singing 
Pig Breakfast Food Company. 
These companies are bitten by the 
small flea of remorse every now 
and then and they want to pitch a 
few coins into some fund for luck. 
It's never many coins that they 
want to pitch — the remorse bug 
that bites them is not a very large 
one. You may be able to stretch it 
to cover your project though, Van- 
hoosier . 

So we had our appropriation 
and our travel. Miss Holly and 
myself. 

Holly Harkel had often been in 
disrepute for her claims to under- 
stand the languages of various 
creatures. There was special out- 
rage to her claim that she would be 
able to understand the Shelni. 
Now that was odd. No disrepute 
attached to Captain Charbonnett 
for his claim to understand the 
planetary simians, and if there was 
ever a phony claim it was this. No 
disrepute attached to Meyrowitz 
for his claim of finding esoteric 
meanings in the patterns of vole 
droppings. But there seemed some- 
thing incredible in the claim of the 
goblin-faced Holly Harkel that not 
only would she be able to under- 
stand the Shelni instantly and 
completely but that they were not 
low scavenger beasts at all, that 
they were genuine goblin people 
who played goblin music and sang 
goblin songs. 



94 



IF 




Holly Harkel had a heart and 
soul too big for her dwarfish body 
and a brain too big for her curious 
little head. That, I suppose, is what 
made her so lumpy everywhere. 
She was entirely compounded of 
love and concern and laughter and 
much of it bulged out from her 
narrow form. Her ugliness was 
one of the unusual things and I be- 
lieve that she enjoyed giving it to 
the worlds. She had loved snakes 
and toads, she had loved monkeys 
and misbegottens. She had come 
to look weirdly like them when we 
studied them. She was a snake 
when we studied them; she was a 
toad when they were our subject. 
She studied every creature from 
the inside of it. And here there was 
an uncommon similarity, even for 
her. 

Holly loved the Shelni instantly. 
She became a Shelni and she 
hadn’t far to go. She moved and 
scooted and climbed like a Shelni. 
She came down trees head first 
like a Shelni or a squirrel. She had 
always seemed to me to be a little 
other than human. And now she 
was avid to record the Shelni 
things “ — before they be gone.” 

A S FOR the Shelni themselves, 
some scientists have called 
them humanoid and then braced 
themselves for the blow and the 
howl. If they were humanoid they 
were certainly the lowest and odd- 
est humanoids ever. But we folk- 
lorists knew intuitively what they 



were. They were goblins pure and 
simple — I do not use the adjectives 
here as cliches. The tallest of them 
were less than three feet tall; the 
oldest were less than seven years 
old. They were, perhaps, the ugliest 
creatures in the universe — and yet 
of a pleasant ugliness. There was 
no evil in them at all. Scientists 
who have tested them have insisted 
that there was no intelligence in 
them either. They were friendly 
and open. Too friendly, too open, 
as it happened, for they were fas- 
cinated by all human things and to 
their harm. But they were no more 
human than a fairy or an ogre is 
human. Less, less, less than a mon- 
key. 

“Here is a den of them,” Holly 
divined that first day (it was the 
day before yesterday). “There will 
be a whole coven of them down 
under here and the door is down 
through the roots of this tree. 
When I got my doctorate in primi- 
tive music I never imagined that I 
would be visiting brownies down 
under tree roots. I should say that 
I never so much as hoped that I 
would be. There was so much that 
they didn’t teach us. There was 
even one period in my life when I 
ceased to believe in goblins.” 

The latter I do not believe. 

Suddenly Holly was into a hole 
in the ground head first, like a 
gopher, like a ground squirrel, like 
a Shelni. I followed her, letting 
myself down carefully and not 
head first. I myself would have to 



RIDE ATINCAN 



95 




study the Shelni from the outside. 
I myself would never be able to 
crawl inside their green goblin 
skins, never be able to croak or 
carol with their frog tongues, never 
feel what made their popeyes pop. 
I myself would not even have been 
able to sense out their dens. 

And at the bottom of the hole, 
at the entrance of the den itself, 
was an encounter which I disbe- 
lieved at the time I was seeing and 
hearing it. There occurred a con- 
versation which I heard with my 
own ears, they having become 
transcendent for the moment. It 
was in the frog-croak Shelni talk 
between Holly Harkel and the 
five-year-old Ancient who guarded 
the coven, and yet it was in a sort 
of English and I understood it. 

“Knockle, knockle.” (This from 
Holly.) 

“Crows in cockle.” (This from 
the guard.) 

“Wogs and wollie. 

“Who you?” “Holly.” 

‘‘What’s a dinning?” 

“Coming inning.” 

So they let us in. But if you 
think you can enter a Shelni coven 
without first riming with the five- 
year-old Ancient who guards it, 
then it’s plain that you’ve never 
been in one of the places. And 
though the philologists say that the 
speech of the Shelni is meaningless 
croaking, yet it was never mean- 
ingless to Holly and in flashes it 
was not meaningless to me. The 
secret guess of Holly was so. 



Holly had insisted that the Shel- 
ni spoke English within the limits 
of their vocal apparatus. And they 
told her at this very first session 
that they never had had any lan- 
guage of their own “because no 
one had ever made one for us — ” 
so they used English as soon as 
they came to hear it. “We would 
pay you for the use of it if we had 
anything to pay you with,” they 
said. It is frog-croak English but 
only the pure of ear can under- 
stand it. 

I started the recorder and Holly 
started the Shelni. Quite soon she 
had them playing on those jug- 
shaped flutes of theirs. Frog music. 
Ineffably sad sionnach skirries. 
Rook, crow, and daw squabbling 
melody. They were pleasant, weird 
little pieces of music that sounded 
as thpugh they were played under 
water. It would be hard to imagine 
them not played under the ground 
at least. 

The tunes were short, as all 
tunes of children are short. There 
was no real orchestration, though 
that should have been possible with 
the seven flutes differently jugged 
and tuned. Yet there was true mel- 
ody in these: short, complete, 
closed melody, dwarfed perfec- 
tion. They were underground 
fugues full of worms’ blood and 
cool as root cider. They were lo- 
cust and chaffer and cricket din. 

Then Holly got one of the most 
ancient of the Shelni to tell stories 
while the jug-flutes chortled. Here 



96 



IF 




are the two of them that we re- 
corded that first day. Others who 
listen to them today say that there 
is nothing to them but croaking. 
But I heard them with Holly Har- 
kel, she helped interpret them to 
me, so I can hear and understand 
them perfectly in frog-croak Eng- 
lish. • 

Take them. Grisly Posterity! I 
am not sure that you deserve even 
this much of the Shelni. 

THE SHELNI WHO LOST HIS 
BURIAL TOOTH 

It is told this way. 

There was a Shelni who 
lost his burial tooth before 
he died. Every Shelni begins 
life with six teeth, and he 
loses one every year. Then, 
when he is very old and has 
only one tooth left, he dies. 

He must give the last tooth 
to the Skokie burial-person 
to pay for his burial. But this 
Shelni had either lost two 
teeth in one year or else he 
had lived to too great an age. 

He died. And he had no 
tooth left to pay with. 

“I will not bury you if you 
have no tooth left to pay me 
with,” said the Skokie buri- 
al person. “Should I work 
for nothing?” 

“Then I will bury myself,” 
said the dead Shelni. 

“You don’t know how,” 
said the Skokie burial-per- 



son. “You don’t know the 
places that are left. You will 
find that all the places are 
full. I have an agreement 
that everybody should tell 
everybody all the places are 
full, so only the burial-per- 
son may bury. That is my 
job.” 

Nevertheless, the dead 
Shelni went to find a place 
to bury himself. He dug a 
little hole in the meadow 
but wherever he dug he 
found that it was already full 
of dead Shelnis or Skokies 
or frogs. And they always 
made him put all the dirt 
back that he had dug. 

He dug holes in the valley 
and it was the same thing. 
He dug holes on the hill, and 
they told him that the hill 
was full, too. So he went 
away crying, for he could 
find no place to lie down. 

He asked the Eanlaith 
whether he could stay in 
their tree. And they said no, 
he could not. They would 
not let any dead folks live in 
their tree. 

He asked the Eise if he 
could stay in their pond. And 
they said no, he could not. 
They would not allow any 
dead folks in their pond. 

He asked the Sionnach if 
he could sleep in their den. 
And they said no, he could 



RIDE ATINCAN 



97 




not. They liked him when he 
was alive but a dead person 
has hardly any friends at all. 

So the poor dead Shelni 
wanders yet and can find no 
place to rest his head. He 
will wander forever unless 
he can find another burial 
tooth to pay with. 

They used to tell it so. 

O NE comment on this burial 
story— the Shelni do have 
careful burial. But the burial crypts 
are plainly dug, not by the six-fin- 
gered Shelni but by the seven- 
clawed Skokie. There must be 
substance to the Skokie burial- 
person. Moreover, the Skokie, 
though higher on the very low 
scale than the Shelni, do not bury 
their own. 

Furthermore, there are no Shel- 
ni remains going back more than 
about thirty equivalent years. 
There are no random-lying or fos- 
sil Shelni at all. 

The second story (of the first 
day). 

THE SHELNI WHO TURNED 
INTO A TREE 
This is how they tell it. 

There was a woman who 
was neither Shelni nor Sko- 
kie nor frog. She was Sky 
Woman. One day she came 
with her child and sat down 
under a Shelni tree. When 
she got up to go she left her 
own child who was asleep 



and picked up a Shelni child 
by mistake. Then the Shelni 
woman came to get her own 
child and she looked at it. 
She did not know what was 
wrong but it was a Sky Peo- 
ple child. 

“Oh, it has pink skin and 
flat'eyes! How can that be?” 
the Shelni woman asked. But 
she took it home with her 
and it still lives with the 
Shelni and everyone has for- 
gotten the difference. 

Nobody knows whaj ^the 
Sky woman thought when 
she got the Shelni child home 
and looked at it. Neverthe- 
less she kept it and it grew 
and was more handsome than 
any of them. 

But when the second year 
came and the young Shelni 
was grown it walked in the 
woods and said, “I do not 
feel like a Sky people. But if 
I am not a Sky people, then 
what am I? I am hot a duck. 
I am not a frog. And if I am 
a bird, what kind of bird am 
I? There is nothing left. It 
must be that I am a tree.” 
There was reason for this. 
We Shelni do look a little bit 
like trees. 

So the Shelni put down 
roots and grew bark and 
worked hard at being a tree. 
He underwent all the hard- 
ships that are the life of a 
tree. He was gnawed by 



98 



IF 




goats and gobniu. He was 
rough-tongued by cattle and 
crom. He was infested by 
slugs and befouled by the 
nameless animal. Moreover, 
parts of him were cut away 
for firewood. 

But he kept feeling the 
jug-music creeping up all the 
way from his undertoes to his 
hair and he knew that this 
music was what he had al- 
ways been looking for. It was 
the same jug and tine music 
that you hear even now. 

Then a bird told the Shel- 
ni that he was not really a 
tree but that it was too late 
for him to leave off growing 
like a tree. He had brothers 
and sisters and kindred living 
in the hole down under his 
roots, the bird said, and they 
would have no home if he 
stopped being a tree. 

This is the tree that is the 
roof of our den where we are 
even now. This tree is our 
brother who was lost and who 
forgot that he was a Shelni. 

This is the way it has al- 
ways been told. 

On the second day it was re- 
markable how much Holly had 
come to look like a Shelni. And 
she was hardly taller than they 
were. I had never realized that she 
was so small. Ah, well, she has 
come to look like every sort of 
creature we have ever studied to- 



gether. Holly insists that the Shel- 
ni have intelligence and I half 
agree with her. But the paragraph 
in the basic manual of this world 
is against us: 

— a tendency to attribute to the 
Shelni an intelligence which they 
do not possess, perhaps due to 
their fancied human resemblance. 
In maze-running they are definite- 
ly inferior to the rodents. In the 
manipulation of latches and stops 
they are less adept than the Earth 
raccoons or the asteroid rojon. 
In tool handling and true mimicry 
they are far from equal to the 
simians. In simple foraging and 
the instinct for survival they are 
far below the hog or the harzl. In 
mneme, the necessary prelude to 
intelligence, they are about on par 
with the turtles. Their “speech” 
lacks the verisimilitude of the talk- 
ing birds, and their “music” is 
below that of the insects. They 
make poor watch-dogs and in- 
adequate scarecrows. It appears 
that the move to ban shelniphagi, 
though perhaps sincere, is ill-ad- 
vised. After all, as an early space- 
man put it: “What else are they 
good for?” 

Well, we have to admit that the 
Shelni are not as intelligent as 
rats or hogs or harzls. Yet I, 
surely due to the influence of Hol- 
ly, feel a stronger affinity to them 
than to rats or hogs or coons or 
crows or whatever. But no crea- 
ture is so helpless as the Shelni. 

How do they even get together?

The Shelni have many sorts of 
songs but they do not have any 
romantic songs in our sense. Af- 
ter all, they are small children till 
they die of old age. Their sexual 
relationship seems distinguished 
either by total unawareness or by 
extreme bashfulness. 

“T don’t see how they bring it 
¥ off at all, Vincent,” Holly 
said the second day (which was 
yesterday). “They are here, so they 
must have been born. But how do 
these bashful and scatterbrained 
three-year-olds ever get together 
to bring it off? I can’t find any- 
thing at all in their legends or act- 
ing patterns, can you? In their 
legends all their children are 
foundlings. They are born or dis- 
covered under a blueberry bush 
(my translation of spionam). Or 
alternately — and in other cycles — 
they are found under a quicken 
tree or in a cucumber patch. In 
common sense we must assume 
that the Shelni are placental and 
viviparous. But should we apply 
common sense to goblin folk? 
They also have legend that they 
are fungoid and spring out of the 
ground at night like mushrooms. 
And that if a Shelni woman wishes 
a child she must buy a fungoid slip 
from a Skokie and plant it into 
the ground. Then she will have her 
child ready the next morning.” 

But Holly was depressed yes- 
terday morning. She had seen 
some copy by our sponsor, The 



Singing Pig Breakfast Food Com- 
pany, and it disturbed her! 

“Singing Pig! The Children love 
it! Nourishing Novelty! Nursery 
Rhyme Characters in a can for 
your convenience! Real Meat from 
Real Goblins! No fat, no bones. 
If your can has a lucky number 
tab you can receive free a facsimile 
Shelni jug-flute. Be the first on 
your block to serve Singing Pig, 
the meat from real Goblins. Corn-

Oh, well, it was only an adver- 
tisement that they used back on 
World. We had our recording to 
do. 

“Vincent, I don’t know how 
they got here,” Holly said, “but I 
know they won’t be here very long. 
Hurry, hurry, we have to get it 
down! I will make them remem- 
bered somehow.” 

Holly, got them to play on the 
tines that second day (which was 
yesterday). There had been an im- 
pediment the day before, she said. 
The tines may not be played for 
one until the second day of ac- 
quaintance. The Shelni do not 
have stringed instruments. Their 
place is taken by the tines, the 
vibrating, singing forks. They play 
these many-pronged, tuned forks 
like harps and in playing them 
they use the tree roots for sound- 
ing boards so that even the leaves 
in the air above partake a little of 
the music. The tines, the forks are 
themselves of wood, of a certain 
very hard but light wood that is

Here are two more of those bal- “That is nobody’s wife,” 
lad stories that we recorded on the the Shelni told the Skokie. 



second day (which was yesterday). 

THE SKOKIE WHO LOST HIS WIFE 

This is the way they tell it. 

A Skokie heard a Shelni 
jug-flute jugging one night. 

“That is the voice of my 
wife,” the Skokie said. “I’d 
know it anywhere.” 

The Skokie came over the 
moors to find his wife. He 
went down into the hole in 
the ground that his wife’s 
voice was coming from. But 
all he found there was a 
Shelni playing a jug-flute. 

“I am looking for my 
poor lost wife,” the Skokie 
said. “I have heard her voice 
just now coming out of this 
hole. Where is she?” 

“There is nobody here but 
myself,” the Shelni said. “I 
am sitting here alone, play- 
ing my flute to the moons 
whose light runs down the 
walls of my hole.” 

“But I heard her here,” 
said the Skokie, “and I want 
her back.” 



“That is just a little tune that 
I made up.” 

“You play with my wife’s 
voice, so you must have 
swallowed my wife,” the 
Skokie said. “I will have to 
take you apart and see.” 

“If I swallowed anybody’s 
wife, I’m sorry,” said the 
Shelni. “Go ahead then.” 

So the Skokie took the 
Shelni apart and scattered 
the pieces all over the hole 
and some of them on the 
grass outside. But he could 
not find any part of his wife. 

“I have made a mistake,” 
said the Skokie. “Who 
would have thought that one 
who had not swallowed my 
wife could make her voice 
on the flute!” 

“It is all right,” said the 
Shelni, “as long as you put 
me together again. I remem- 
ber part of the way I go. If 
you remember the rest of the 
way, you can put me to- 
gether again.” 

But neither of them re- 
membered very well the way 



RIDE ATINCAN 



101 




the Shelni was before he was 
taken apart. The Skokie put 
him together all wrong. 

There were not enough 
pieces for some parts and 
too many for others. 

“Let me help,” said a frog 
who was there. “I remember 
where some of the parts go. 
Besides, I believe it was my 
own wife he swallowed. That 
was her voice on the flute. It 
was not a Skokie voice.” 

The frog helped and they 
all remembered what they 
could but it did not work. 
Parts of the Shelni could not 
be found again and some of 
the parts would not go into 
him at all. When they had 
him finished the Shelni was 
in great pain and could 
hardly move and he didn’t 
look much like a Shelni. 

“I’ve done all I can,” the 
Skokie said. “That’s the way 
you’ll have to be. Where is 
frog?” 

“I’m inside,” said frog. 

“That’s where you will 
have to stay,” the Skokie 
said. “I’ve had enough of 
both of you. Enough — and 
these pieces left over. I will 
just take them with me. 
Maybe I can make someone 
else out of them.” 

That is the way the Shelni 
still is, put together all 
wrong. In his wrong form he 
walks the country by night, 



being ashamed to go by day. 
Some folks are startled 
when they meet him, not 
knowing this story. He still 
plays his jug-flute with the 
lost Skokie wife’s voice and 
with frog’s voice. Listen, you 
can hear it now! The Shelni 
goes in sorrow and pain be- 
cause nobody knows how to 
put him together right. 

The Skokie never did find 
his lost wife. 

This is how it is told. 

A ND then there was the story 
that we recorded yesterday — 
the last story, though we did not 
know it then, that we would re- 
cord of the Shelni: 

THE SINGING PIGS 

This is how they say it. 

We have the ancient story 
of the singing pigs who sing 
so loud that they fly up into v 
the sky on the tail of their 
own singing. Now we our- 
selves, if we can sing loud 
enough, if we can jug the 
flutes strong enough, if we 
can tang the tines deep 
enough, will get to be the 
Singing Pigs of our own 
story. Many already have 
gone away as Singing Pigs. 

There come certain bell- 
men with music carts. They 
play rangle-dangle Sky mu- 
sic. They come for love of 



102 



IF 




us. And if we can hurry fast 
enough when they come we 
can go with them, we can 
ride a tin can over the sky. 

Bong, bong, that is the 
bell-man with the music 
cart now! All the Shelni hur- 
ry! This is the day you may 
get to go. Come all you 
Shelni from the valley and 
the stream and jump on the 
cart for the free ride. Come 
all the Shelni from the mea- 
dow and the woods. Come 
up from the tree roots and 
the holes under ground. The 
Skokie don’t get to go, the 
frogs don’t get to go, only 
the Shelni get to go. 

Cry if the cart is too full 
and you don’t get to go to- 
day but don’t cry too long. 
The bell-men say that they 
will come back tomorrow 
and every day till there are 
no Shelni left at all. 

“Come all you little Sing- 
ing-Pig-Shelni,” a bell-man 
shouts. “Come get your free 
rides in the tin cans all the 
way to Earth! Hey, Ben, 
what other animal jumps 
onto the slaughter wagon 
when you only ring a bell? 
Come along little Shelni- 
Pigs, room for ten more on

all. We’ll have lots more wa- 
gons going tomorrow. We’ll

little pigs cry when there’s 
no more room for them on 
the slaughter wagon?” These 
are the high kind words that 
a bell-man speaks for love of 
us. 

Not even have to give a 
burial tooth or other tooth 
to pay for the ride. Frogs 
can’t go, Skokies can’t go, 
only the Shelni get to go! 

Here are the wonderful 
things! From the wagon the 
Shelni get to go to one room 
where all their bones are 
taken out. This does never 
happen to Shelni before. In 
another room the Shelni 
are boiled down to only half 
their size, little as little-boy 
Shelni. Then they all get to 
play the game and crawl in- 
to the tin cans. And then 
they get their free ride in the 
tin cans all the way to Earth. 
Ride a tin can! 

Wipe off your sticky tears, 
you who miss the music cart 
today. Go to sleep early to- 
night and rise early tomor- 
row. Sing your loudest to- 
morrow so the bell-men will 
know where to come. Jug 
the flutes very strong tomor- 
row, tang the tines deep, say 
whoop whoop here we are, 
bell-men. 

All laugh when they go 
with the bell-men in the mu- 
sic cart. But there is story 
that someday a Shelni wom- 



an will cry instead of laugh 
when they take her. What 
can be the matter with this 
woman that she will cry? 

She will cry out “Damn you, 
it’s murder! They’re almost 
people! You can’t take 
them! They’re as much peo- 
ple as I am. Double damn 
you, you can’t take me! I’m 
human. I know I look as 
funny as they do but I’m hu- 
man. Oh, oh, oh!” This is 
the funniest thing of the 
story, the prophecy thing 
part. 

“Oh, oh, oh,” the woman 
will say. Oh, oh, oh, the jug- 
flutes will echo. What will 
be the matter with the Shel- 
ni woman who cries instead 
of laughs. 

This is our last story, 
wherever it is told. When it 
is told for the last time, then 
there will be no more stories 
here, there will be no more 
Shelni. Who needs stories 
and jug-flute music who can 
ride a tin can? 

That is how it has been 
said. 

Then we went out (for the last 
time, as it happened) from the 
Shelni burrow. And, as always, 
there was the rhyming with the 
five-year-old Ancient who guarded 
the place!

BLOOD 



GENE WOLFE

A puzzle for angels: How 
many humans can survive 
each other in infinity? 



W HEN GIBSON awoke Lo- 
renz was asleep and Cappio, 
whose acceleration couch was be- 
tween theirs, was dead. Cappio’s 
throat was cut and, lying back as 
he was, the edges of the cut were 
drawn slightly apart as though 
Cappio had evolved, in the deep 
of space, a gill just under his chin. 
The blood had spurted far in the 
weak gravity, splattering the in- 
strument panel and the observa- 
tion port and filling Cappio’s lap 
with a pool which was now dark- 
ening and coagulating. Gibson 
looked at Lorenz, still asleep. 
There were — had been — only the 
three of them between Earth and 
Mars. It was the easiest murder 
mystery in the universe to solve. 

It occured to him that now, 
while Lorenz was still asleep, was 
the time to do something. To pro- 
tect himself, to bind or if neces- 
sary even kill Lorenz. Briefly he 
pictured himself confronting Dr. 
Mann, the chief psychologist at 
Moonbase. 

Well, what do I do now , Doc- 
tor , outward bound with a corpse 
and a murderer? 

Then Lorenz’s eyes were open 
and it was too late. 

For a second Lorenz was blank 
and unfocused. Then full con- 
sciousness came and he saw Cap- 
pio. He jerked erect. 

The old bitterness, the hatred 
Gibson had built up for Lorenz 
and Cappio too during the endless 
months in the capsule, came rush- 



ing back. Whatever happened he 
was glad that Lorenz had done 
this, glad Lorenz would be con- 
demned if they ever got back, 
glad Cappio was dead. 

Lorenz reached over and 
touched Cappio’s dead cheek very 
gently with the tips of his fingers. 

He said, “Why did you do it, 
Gib?” 

For a moment Gibson felt al- 
most like laughing. Lorenz was go- 
ing to dodge and trim to the last. 

He said, “Commander, you 
stink.” 

“We all stink, bottled up in here 
— but that was no reason to kill 
Major Cappio.” 

“I mean you stink morally.” 

Gibson’s pressure suit was hang- 
ing behind him and he reached as 
quickly as he could for the utility 
knife in the tool belt. He saw the 
fear in Lorenz’s eyes then and 
knew he could kill Lorenz if he 
wished. But Lorenz had his own 
knife out, threatening him across 
Cappio’s body. 

“Why?” Lorenz asked. “Why 
did you do it, Gib?” 

“It’s no use blaming me, Lo- 
renz. When they get us back 
they’ll give you drugs and a lie- 
detector test. You’re going to 
spend the rest of your life in pris- 
on. 

“You’re saying I killed him?” 

“I know you did. For God’s 
sake, Lorenz, there are only the 
two of us.” 

“Look.” Lorenz suddenly ex- 



106 



IF 




tended his knife to Gibson. “Look 
at the blade. It’s clean, isn’t it?” 

Gibson nodded reluctantly. 

“Now let me see yours.” 

“You really think I’m going to 
give it to you so that you can kill 
me too?” 

“Just hold it up where I can see 
it.” 

Gibson held his knife up, keep- 
ing it well away from Lorenz. The 
blade was as clean as Lorenz’s had 
been. 

“What does this prove,” he 
asked Lorenz, “except that you 
were smart enough to wipe your 
knife afterward?” 

“I could say the same thing to 
you.” 

“But you won’t, because you 
did it.” 

“No. You did it, Gib. You’ve 
been cracking up for the last six 
weeks at least — but I’m trying to 
find out whether or not you re- 
member the act. Putting it anoth- 
er way, whether or not I dare let 
you continue functioning as a 
member of the crew. The fact that 
you let me live suggests I might. 
The fact that you cleaned your 
knife — well,” Lorenz paused and 
shrugged, “I was going to say it 
suggested a conscious and sane 
premeditation but perhaps I’m 
wrong. That kind of neatness 
could be symptomatic, I guess. Dr. 
Mann would know.” 

“If the radio worked — ” 

“If the radio worked this prob- 
ably wouldn’t have happened.” 



“Or if the deodorizer hadn’t 
gone out,” Gibson finished for 
him. “Or any of the other things 
hadn’t gone wrong. We’re not go- 
ing to make it, ■are we, Command- 
er? So what does it matter, your 
killing Cappio? Cappio was an S. 
O.B. anyway — he hated us both 
and we’re all going to die out here 
in space. We just can’t make it.” 
“Certainly we’re going to make 
it,” Lorenz said. “Nothing that’s 
happened so far will prevent us 
from making a good landing on 
Mars — and Cappio was a nice 
enough guy back on Earth, as I re- 
member, and even on the moon.” 
“With no radio they won’t even 
know we made it.” They had ar- 
gued this a dozen times since the 
radio went out and Gibson sud- 
denly realized that already, even 
with Cappio lying dead between 
them, they were falling back into 
the old pattern. To wrench them 
away from that deep groove he 
asked, “What are we going to do 
with the body?” 

L ORENZ had opened a packet 
of cleaner and was swabbing 
Cappio’s blood from the observa- 
tion port. Because the capsule was 
kept spinning to give them a gentle 
pseudogravitational effect the 
stars made bright, concentric cir- 
cles of light in the port. When 
they had begun the mission Mars 
itself had circled as well since they 
were aimed toward the point were 
it would be, rather than to what 



THOU SPARK OF BLOOD 



107 




had been its present location. Now 
they were close enough for the 
spin to be almost unnoticeable 
when Gibson looked only at Mars, 
a hard-edged, red dot in the cen- 
ter of the port. 

“Do you suppose that made you 
do it?” he asked Lorenz. 

“What?” Lorenz threw the 
packet of cleaner into the disposer 
and looked at him. “What are you 
talking about, Gib?” 

“Suppose the astrologers were 
right — Mars breeds strife. Thou 
spark of blood, thou eye of death 
look’d down, Thou wanderer 
image of a burning town.’ ” 

“Nuts.” 

“According to you I never know 
what I’m talking about, do I, Lo- 
renz?” 

“Gib, things are bad enough 
without our fighting.” 

Gibson laughed. 

“You cut Cappio’s throat and 
now you tell me we shouldn’t 
fight.” 

“We’ll have to throw his body 
out the hatch, I guess.” 

“Out the hatch?” 

“We can’t leave it in here. 
Come on, let’s suit up.” 

Gibson put on his pressure suit 
carefully, watching Lorenz, but 
Lorenz had put his knife back in- 
to his belt and made no sudden 
motion toward him. 

At last Gibson called, “Ready?” 
“Ready,” Lorenz said. 

His voice was tinny over the 
suit radio. 



The hatch was on Gibson’s side 
but he did not want to turn his 
back on Lorenz to open it. He 
stood sideways instead to pull at 
the big operating wheel. It would 
not move. 

Lorenz asked, “What’s the mat- 
ter?” 

Gibson tugged again. “It won’t 
budge. It’s stuck.” 

Lorenz stepped across Cappio’s 
body to help him but the lock was 
jammed. 

“My God,” Lorenz said, “if we 
can’t get it open we won’t be able 
to use it when we get to Mars.” 
“We can detonate the explosive 
bolts — emergency procedure.” 
“Sure, but you only open it that 
way once. After that we’ve lost our 
seal. We won’t be able to keep a 
terrestrial atmosphere in the cap- 
sule.” 

Gibson seated himself on his 
couch again and opened the face 
shield of his helmet. “Maybe we 
can fix it when we land.” 

“Maybe. Aren’t you going to 
take off your suit?” 

The suit was as good as armor, 
Gibson thought. It would protect 
him from Lorenz’s knife. 

“Not now. I’m too tired.” 
-Lorenz snorted. “We haven’t 
done anything for weeks except 
snap at each other. Why should 
you be tired?” He was stripping 
off his own suit. 

Why should he worry? He 
knows I didn't kill Cappio — he 
hasn't anything to be afraid of . 



108 



IF 




Aloud he said, “What are we 
going to do with the body?” 

“Put it through the disposer. 
What else can we do? We’ll have 
to cut it up.” 

“You,” Gibson said. 

“You won’t help?” 

Gibson shook his head and Lo- 
renz shrugged. 

“Somebody’s got to.” 

H E TOOK the knife from his 
suit belt again and looked at 
Cappio, trying to decide where to 
start. Gibson watched him. After 
a moment Lorenz decided on the 
arm nearest him. He laid it on the 
armrest and cut off the hand, 
working his blade through the 
small bones in the wrist. As Gib- 
son watched he picked up the 
hand by the index finger and 
dropped it into the disposer, then 
bent over Cappio again to unjoint 
the elbow. Gibson drove his knife 
into the back of his neck then and 
Lorenz fell face down into Cap- 
pio’s lap. 

For a long time after that Gib- 
son sat staring out the observation 
port at the red dot of Mars. The 
hi-fi had broken when they were 
two weeks out but he tried it 
again anyway. It still didn’t work, 
so he read the descriptions on the 
tapes instead, trying to remember 
what they should sound like. 

After a while he picked up the 
microphone of the dead radio and 
pushed the dead transmit button 
and said, “This is Gibson. I have 

THOU SPARK OF BLOOD 



killed Commander Lorenz be- 
cause he murdered Major Cappio 
and I am sure that he was going to 
kill me. I intend to continue the 
mission but I am not going to re- 
turn. The State Department may, 
if it likes, claim Mars on the 
grounds that it has a permanent 
American resident. Send un- 
manned supply rockets. I require 
airlock parts, radio repair — ” 

He put down the microphone. 

The disposer broke when he 
tried to put Cappio’s femur 
through it. That left about two- 
thirds of Cappio’s body and all of 
Lorenz’s still in the cabin. 

Gibson did the best he could. 
He sprinkled all the salt from the 
ration packets over them and put 
them in their pressure suits. The 
suits, being airtight, he thought 
should at least prevent the odor of 
the decaying bodies from fouling 
the air of the cabin. The calendar 
clock on the instrument panel 
showed that it was the hundred 
and thirty-fifth day of the flight. 
By the hundred and thirty-eighth 
Gibson knew he had been wrong. 
The suits leaked. 

He examined them carefully, 
inch by inch. Cappio’s was sound 
but Lorenz’s had been sabotaged 
at the back of one knee joint where 
something like a screwdriver or a 
utility knife blade had been driven 
in to destroy the seal of the deli- 
cately fitted parts. The same thing 
had been done to his own suit and

miliar planet, apparently in an ear- 
lier time. Inhabitants are Earth 
aborigines and apparently Ab- 
nethe s subjects. They try to kill 
him but he is rescued by Fanny 
Mae, brought back to his own 
time. 

When all attempts to decipher 
the location of Abnethe s hideout 
planets fail , McKie volunteers as 
bait. He returns to Fanny Mae's 
Beachball. There two attempts to 
kill him as Furuneo had been slain 
are foiled but neither Abnethe nor 
her Pan Spechi lover and aide, 
Cheo, betray their whereabouts. 

Meantime the Sentient labora- 
tory where possible clues to Ab- 
nethe and Cheo are under study is 
turned into a shambles via a jump- 
door attack. McKie rushes over. 

In the lab he feels a constant 
threat while he and the Sentient 
scientists are trying discern a read- 
able pattern behind Abnethe’s ac- 
tivities. 

As they are beginning to ap- 
proach a reasonable answer, Mc- 
Kie once again is attacked through 
a jumpdoor. The attack is foiled.

I T WAS midafternoon on Cen- 
tral before Tuluk sent for Mc- 
Kie to return to the lab. Two 
squads of enforcers accompanied 
McKie. There were enforcers all 
around in augmented force. They 
watched the air, the walls, the 
floors. They watched each other 
and the space around their alter- 
nate numbers. Every sentient 
carried a raygen at the ready. 

McKie, having spent two hours 
with Hanaman and five of her 
aides in Legal, was ready for 
down-to-dirt facts. Legal was 
moving to search every Abnethe 
property, to seize every record 
they could find — but it was all off 
there somewhere in the rarefied 
atmosphere of symbols. Perhaps 
something would come of it, 
though. They had a Telecourt or- 
der, reproduced thousands of 
times, giving the Bureau’s en- 
forcement arm sufficient authority 
for search on most worlds outside 
the Gowachin pale. Gowachin of- 
ficials were moving in their own 
way to cooperate — exonerating 
sufficient enforcers, clearing the 
names of appropriate police 
agencies. 

Crime-One police on Central 
and elsewhere were assisting. They 
had provided enforcers, opened 
files normally not privileged to 
BuSab, linked their identification 
and modus computers tempor- 
arily to BuSab’s core.

It was action, of course, but it two steps to reach the paper, 
struck McKie as too circuitous, picked it up, studied it. The writ- 
too abstract. They needed another ing was in Tuluk’s neat script. 



kind of line to Abnethe, some- 
thing connected to her that could 
be reeled in despite her attempts to 
escape. 

Eight enforcers had crowded 
into the small lab with Tuluk. 
They were being self-effacing, 
apologetic — evidence that Tuluk 
had protested in that bitingly sar- 
castic way Wreaves had. 

Tuluk glanced up at McKie’s 
entrance, returned to examining 
a metal sliver held in stasis by a 
subtron field beneath a bank of 
multicolored lights on his bench. 

“Fascinating stuff, this steel,” 
he said, lowering his head to per- 
mit one of his shorter and more 
delicate mandibular extensors to 
get a better grip on a probe with 
which he was tapping the metal. 

“So it’s steel,” McKie said, 
watching the operation. 

Each time Tuluk tapped the 
metal it gave off a shimmering 
spray of purple sparks. They re- 
minded McKie of something just 
at the edge of memory. He 
couldn’t quite place the associa- 
tion. A shower of sparks. He 
shook his head. 

“There’s a chart down the 
bench,” Tuluk said. “You might 
have a look at it while I finish 
here.” 

McKie glanced to his right, saw 
an oblong of chalf paper with writ- 
ing on it. He moved the necessary 



Substance: steel, an iron- 
base alloy. Sample contains 
small am’ts manganese, car- 
bon, sulfur, phosphorus and 
silicon, some nickel, zirconi- 
um and tungsten with ad- 
mixture chromium, moly- 
bdenum and vanadium. 

Source comparison: 
matches Second-Age steel 
used by human political sub- 
unit Japan in making of 
swords for Samurai Revi- 
val. 

Tempering: sample hard- 
quenched on cutting edge 
only; back of sword remains 
soft. 

Estimated length of orig- 
inal artifact: 1.01 meter. 

Handle: linen cord 

wrapped over bone and lac- 
quered. (See lacquer, bone 
and cord analyses: attached.) 

McKie glanced at the attached 
sheet: bone from a sea mammal’s 
tooth, reworked after use on some 
other artifact, nature unknown but 
containing bronze. 

The linen cord’s analysis was 
interesting. It was of relatively re- 
cent manufacture and it displayed 
the same submolecular character- 
istics as the earlier samples of raw- 
hide.

T HE lacquer was even more in- 
teresting. It was based in an 
evaporative solvent which was 
identified as a coal tar derivative — 
but the purified sap was from an 
ancient Coccus Lacca insect ex- 
tinct for millennia. 

“You get to the part about the 
lacquer yet?” Tuluk asked, glanc- 
ing up and twisting his face slit 
aside to look at McKie. 

“Yes.” 

“What do you think of my 
theory now?” 

“I’ll believe anything that 
works,” McKie growled. 

Tuluk returned to his examina- 
tion of the metal. 

“How’re your wounds?” 

“I’ll recover.” McKie touched 
the omniflesh patch at his temple. 
*“What’s that you’re doing now?” 
“This material ' was fashioned 
by hammering,” Tuluk said, not 
looking up. “I’m reconstructing 
the pattern of the blows that 
shaped it.” 

He shut off the stasis field, 
caught the metal deftly in an ex- 
tended mandible. 

“Why?” 

Tuluk tossed the metal onto the 
bench, racked the probe, faced Mc- 
Kie. 

“Manufacture of swords such 
as this was a jealously guarded 
craft,” he said. “It was handed 
down in families, father to son, for 
centuries. The irregularity of the 
hammer blows used by each arti- 
san followed characteristic pat- 



terns to an extent that the maker 
can be identified without ques- 
tion by sampling that pattern. Col- 
lectors developed the method to 
verify authenticity. It’s as definite 
as an eye print, more positive than 
any skin-print anomaly.” 

“So what did you find out?” 

“I ran the test twice,” Tuluk 
said, “to be certain. Despite the 
fact that cell revivification^ests on 
lacquer and cord attachments 
show this sword to have been 
manufactured no more than eighty 
years ago, the steel was fashioned 
by an artisan dead more thousands 
of years than I care to contem- 
plate. His name was Kinemura 
and I can give you the index ref- 
erents to verify this. There’s no 
doubt who made that sword.” 

The interphone above Tuluk’s 
bench chimed twice and the face 
of Hanaman from Legal appeared 
on it. 

“Oh, there you are, McKie,” 
she said, peering past Tuluk. 

“What now?” McKie asked, his 
mind still dazed by Tuluk’s state- 
ment. 

“We’ve managed to get those 
injunctions,” she said. “They .lock 
up Abnethe’s wealth and produc- 
tion on every sentient world except 
the Gowachin.” 

“But what about the warrants?” 

“Of course — those, too,” Han- 
aman said. “That’s why I’m call- 
ing. You asked to be notified 
immediately.” 

“Are the Gowachin cooper- 



114 



IF 




ating?” McKie asked thoughtfully. 

“They’ve agreed to declaration 
of a ConSent emergency in their 
jurisdiction. That allows all Fed- 
eration police and BuSab agencies 
to act there for apprehension of 
suspects.’’ 

“Fine,’’ McKie said. “Now, if 
you could only tell me when to 
find her I think we can pick her 
up.’’ 

Hanaman looked from the 
screen with a puzzled frown. 

“When?” 

“Yeah,” McKie snarled. 
“When.” 

T HE report on the Palenki 
Phyllum pattern was waiting 
for McKie when he returned to 
Bildoon’s office for their strategy 
conference. The conference had 
been scheduled earlier and post- 
poned twice that day. It was al- 
most midnight but most of the Bu- 
reau’s people remained on duty, 
especially the enforcers. Sta-lert 
capsules had been issued along 
with the angeret by the medical 
staff. The enforcer squad accom- 
panying McKie walked with that 
edgy abruptness this mixture of 
chemicals always exacted as pay- 
ment. 

Bildoon’s chairdog had lifted a 
footrest and was ripple-massaging 
the Bureau Chief’s back when Mc- 
Kie entered the office. Opening 
one jeweled eye, Bildoon said, 
“We got the report on the Palenki 
— the shell pattern you holo- 



scanned.” He closed his eye, 
sighed. “It’s on my desk there.” 

McKie patted a chairdog into 
place, said, “I’m tired of reading. 
What’s it say?” 

“Shipsong Phyllum,” Bildoon 
said. “Positive identification. 
“Ahhh, friend— I’m tired, too.” 

“So?” 

McKie was tempted to signal 
for a massage from his chairdog. 
Bildoon was obviously enjoying it. 
But McKie knew a massage might 
put him to sleep. The enforcers 
moving restlessly around the room 
must be as tired as he was. They’d 
be sure to resent it if he popped 
off for a nap. 

“We got warrants and picked 
up the Shipsong Phyllum’s lead- 
er,” Bildoon said. “It claims every 
phyllum associate is accounted 
for.” 

“True?” 

“We’re trying to check it but 
how can you be sure? They keep 
no written records. It’s just a Pal- 
enki’s word, whatever that’s 
worth.” 

“Sworn by its arm, too, no 
doubt,” McKie said. 

“Of course.” Bildoon stopped 
the chairdog massage, sat up. “It’s 
true that phyllum identification 
patterns can be used illegiti- 
mately.” 

“It takes a Palenki three or 
four weeks to regrow an arm.” 

“What’s that signify?” 

“She must have several dozen 
Palenkis in reserve.” 



WHIPPING STAR 



115 




“She could have a million of ’em 
for all we know.’’ 

“Did this Phyllum Leader resent 
its pattern being used by an un- 
authorized Palenki?” 

“Not that we could see.” 

“It was lying,” McKie said. 
“How do you know?” 
“According to the Gowachin 
Juris-dictum, Phyllum Forgery is 
one of the eight Palenki capital 
offenses. And the Gowachin 
should know because they were as- 
signed to educate the Palenkis in 
Acceptable Law when R&R 
brought those one-armed turtles 
into the ConSent fold.” 

Bildoon asked, “How come Le- 
gal didn’t know that? I’ve had 
them researching this from the be- 
ginning.” 

“Privileged legal datum,” Mc- 
Kie said. “Inter-species courtesy 
and all that. You know how the 
Gowachin are about individual 
dignity, privacy, that sort of 
thing.” 

“You’ll be read out of their 
Court when they find out you 
spilled this,” Bildoon said. 

“No. They’ll just appoint me 
prosecutor for the next ten or so 
capital cases in their jurisdiction. 
If the prosecutor accepts a case 
and fails to get a conviction, he’s 
the one they execute, you know.” 
“And if you decline the cases?” 
“Depends on the case. I could 
draw anything from a one-to- 
twenty sentence for some of 
them.” 



“One-to — you mean Standard 
Years?” 

“I don’t mean minutes,” McKie 
growled. 

“Then why’d you tell me?” 

“I want you to let me break 
this Phyllum Leader.” 

“Break him? How?” 

“Have you any idea of how im- 
portant the mystique of the arm is 
to the Palenki?” 

“Some idea. Why?” 

“Some idea,” McKie muttered. 
“Back in the primitive days Palen- 
kis made criminals eat their arms, 
then inhibited regrowth. Much 
loss of face — but even greater in- 
jury to something very deep and 
emotional for the Palenkis.” 
“You’re not seriously suggest- 
ing—” 

“Of course not.” 

“Bildoon shuddered. “You hu- 
mans have a basically blood- 
thirsty nature. Sometimes I think 
we don’t understand you.” 

“Where’s this Palenki?” McKie 
asked. 

“What are you going to do?” 
“Question him. What did you 
think?” 

“After what you just said I 
wasn’t sure.” 

“Come off that, Bildoon. Hey, 
you.” McKie gestured to a Wreave 
enforcer lieutenant. “Bring the Pa- 
lenki in here.” 

The enforcer glanced at Bildoon. 
“Do as he says,” Bildoon said. 
The enforcer looped his mandi- 
bles uncertainly, but turned and 



116 



IF 




left the room, signaling half a 
squad to attend him. 



T EN minutes later the Palenki 
Phyllum Leader was herded 
into Bildoon’s office. McKie 
recognized the snake-weaving pat- 
tern on the Palenki’s carapace, 
nodded to himself: Shipsong Phyl- 
lum, all right. Now that he saw 
it, he made the identification him- 
self. 

The Palenki’s multiple legs 
winked to a stop in front of McKie. 
The turtle face turned toward 
him expectantly. 

“Will you truly make me eat my 
arm?” it asked. 

McKie glanced accusingly at 
the Wreave lieutenant. 

“It asked what kind of human 
you were,” the Wreave explained. 

“I’m glad you rendered such an 
accurate description,” McKie 
said. He faced the Palenki. “What 
do you think?” 

“I think not possible, Ser Mc- 
Kie. Sentients no longer permit 
such barbarities.” 

The turtle mouth rendered the 
words without emotion but the 
arm dangling to the right from its 
head-top juncture writhed with 
uncertainty. 

“I may do something worse,” 
McKie said. 

“What is worse?” the Palenki 
asked. 

“We’ll see, won’t we? Now. You 
can account for every member of 



your Phyllum, is that what you 
claim?” 

“That is correct.” 

“You’re lying,” McKie said, 
voice flat. 

“No.” 

“What’s your Phyllum name?” 
McKie asked. 

“I give that only to Phyllum 
brothers.” 

“Or to the Gowachin,” McKie 
said. 

“You are not Gowachin.” 

In a flat splatting of Gowachin 
grunts, McKie began describing 
the Palenki’s probable unsavory 
ancestry, its evil habits, possible 
punishments for its behavior. He 
concluded with the Gowachin 
identification-burst, the unique 
emotion/word pattern by which 
he was required to identify him- 
self before the Gowachin Bar. 

Presently the Palenki said, “You 
are the human they admitted to 
their Legal Concourse. I’ve heard 
about you.” 

“What’s your Phyllum name?” 
McKie demanded. 

“I am called Biredch of Ank,” 
the Palenki said resignedly. 

“Well, Biredch of Ank, you’re 
a liar.” 

The arm writhed. 

“No.” 

There was terror in the Palenki’s 
manner now. It was a brand of 
fear McKie had been trained to 
recognize in his dealings through 
the Gowachin. He possessed the 
Palenki’s privileged name — he 



WHIPPING STAR 



117 




could demand the arm. 

“You have compounded a cap- 
ital offense,” McKie said. 

“No — no — no — ” 

“What the other sentients in this 
room don’t realize,” McKie said, 
“is that phyllum brothers accept 
gene surgery to affix the identity 
pattern on their carapaces. The in- 
dex marks are grown into the shell. 
Isn’t this true?” 

The Palenki remained silent. 

“It’s true,” McKie said. He 
noted that the enforcers had 
moved into a close ring around 
them, fascinated by this encounter. 
“You,” McKie said, snapping an 
arm toward the Wreave lieutenant. 
“Get your men on their toes.” 

“Toes?” 

“They should be watching every 
corner of this room,” McKie said. 
“You want Abnethe to kill our 
witness?” 

Abashed, the lieutenant turned, 
barked orders to his squad. The 
enforcers already were at their 
shifty, turning, eye-darting inspec- 
tion of the room. The Wreave lieu- 
tenant shook a mandible angrily, 
fell silent. 

McKie returned his attention 
to the Palenki. “Now, Biredch of 
Ank, I’m going to ask you some 
special questions. I already know 
the answers to some of them. If I 
catch you in one lie I’ll consider a 
reversion to barbarism. Too much 
is at stake here. Do you under- 
stand me?” 

“Ser, you cannot believe that — ” 



“Which of your Phyllum mates 
did you sell into slave service with 
Mliss Abnethe?” McKie demand- 
ed. 

“Slaving is a capital offense,” 
the Palenki breathed. 

“I’ve already said you were im- 
plicated in a capital offense,” 
McKie said. “Answer the ques- 
tion.” 

“You ask me to condemn my- 
self?” 

“How much did she pay you?” 
“Who pay me what?” 

“How much did Abnethe pay 
you?” 

“For what?” 

“For your phyllum mates?” 
“What phyllum mates?” 

“That’s the question,” McKie 
said. “I want to know how many 
you sold, how much you were paid 
and where Abnethe took them.” 
“You cannot be serious.” 

“I’m recording this conversa- 
tion,” McKie said. “I’m going to 
call your United Phyllums Coun- 
cil presently, play the recording for 
them and suggest they deal with 
you.” 

“They will laugh at you. What 
evidence could you — ” 

“I’ve your own guilty voice,” 
McKie said. “We’ll get a voice- 
corder analysis of everything 
you’ve said and submit it with the 
recording to your Council.” 
“Voicecorder? What is this?” 
“It’s a device that analyzes 
the subtle pitch and intonation of 
the voice to determine which state- 



118 



IF 




ments are true and which are 
false.” 

“I have never heard of it.” 
“Damn few sentients know all 
the devices BuSab agents use,” 
McKie said. “Now, I’m giving you 
one more chance. How many of 
your mates did you sell?” 

‘ 4, 1TI7HY are you doing this to 
▼ ▼ me? What is so important 
about Abnethe that you should ig- 
nore every inter-species courtesy, 
deny me the rights of — ” 

“I’m trying to save your life,” 
McKie said. 

“Now who is lying?” 

“Unless we find and stop Ab- 
nethe,” McKie said, “damn near 
every sentient in our universe ex- 
cept a few newly hatched chicks 
will die. And they’ll stand almost 
no chance without adult protec- 
tion. You’ve my oath on it.” 

“Is that a solemn oath?” 

“By the egg of my arm,” Mc- 
Kie said. 

The Palenki moaned. “You 
know even this of the egg?” 

“I’m going to invoke your 
name and force you to swear by 
your most solemn oath in just one 
moment,” McKie said. 

“I have sworn by my arm.” 

“Not by the egg of your arm,” 
McKie said. 

The Palenki lowered its head. 
The single arm writhed. 

“How many did you sell?” Mc- 
Kie asked. 

“Only forty-five.” 



“Only forty-five?” 

“That’s all — I swear it.” Glis- 
tening fear oils began oozing from 
the Palenki’s eyes. “She offered so 
much and the chosen ones ac- 
cepted freely. She promised un- 
limited eggs.” 

“No breeding limit?” McKie 
asked. “How could that be?” 

The Palenki glanced fearfully 
at Bildoon, who sat hunched across 
the desk, face grim. 

“She would not explain other 
than to say she had found new 
worlds beyond the ConSent juris- 
diction.” 

“Where are those worlds?” Mc- 
Kie asked. 

“I don’t know. This I swear by 
the egg of my arm — I don’t know.” 
“How was the deal set up?” 
“There was a Pan Spechi.” 
“What did he do?” 

“He offered my phyllum the 
profits from twenty worlds for one 
hundred standard years.” 

Someone behind McKie whis- 
tled. 

“When and where did this trans- 
action take place?” McKie asked. 

“In the home of my eggs only 
a year ago.” 

“A hundred years’ profits,” 
McKie muttered. “A safe deal. 
You and your phyllum won’t be 
around even a fraction that long if 
she succeeds in what she’s plan- 
ning.” 

“I didn’t know. I swear I didn’t 
know. What is she doing?” 



WHIPPING STAR 



119 




McKie ignored the question. 
“Have you any clue at all as to 
where her worlds may be?” 

“I swear not,” the Palenki said. 
“Bring your voicecorder. It will 
prove I speak the truth.” 

“There’s no such thing as a 
voicecorder for your species,” Mc- 
Kie said. 

The Palenki stared at him a mo- 
ment. Then: “May your eggs rot?” 
“Describe the Pan Spechi.” 

“I withdraw my cooperation.” 
“You’re in too far now,” McKie 
said, “and my deal’s the only one 
in town.” 

“Deal?” 

“If you cooperate, everyone in 
this room will forget your admis- 
sions of guilt.” 

“More trickery — ” 

McKie looked at Bildoon. 

“I think we’d better call in the 
Palenki Council and give them the 
full report.” 

“I think so,” Bildoon agreed. 
“Wait,” the Palenki said. “How 
do I know I can trust you?” 

“You don’t,” McKie said. 

“But I have no choice, is that 
what you say?” 

“That’s what I say.” 

“May your eggs rot if you be- 
tray me.” 

“Every one of them,” McKie 
agreed. “Describe your Pan Spe- 
chi.” 

“He was ego-frozen,” the Pa- 
lenki said. “I saw the scars and he 
bragged of it to show that I could 
trust him.” 



“Describe him.” 

“One Pan Spechi looks much 
like another. I don’t know — but 
the scars were purple. I remember 
that.” 

“Did he have a name?” 

“He was called Cheo.” 

McKie glanced again at Bil- 
doon. 

“The name signifies new mean- 
ings for old ideas,” Bildoon said. 
“It’s in one of our ancient dia- 
lects. Obviously an alias.” 

McKie returned his attention to 
the Palenki. “What kind of agree- 
ment did he give you?” 
“Agreement?” 

“Contract — surety. How did 
he insure the payoff?” 

“Oh. He appointed phyllum 
mates of my selection as mana- 
gers on the chosen worlds.” 

“Neat,” McKie said. “Simple 
hiring agreements. Who could 
fault a deal like that or prove any- 
thing by it?” 

McKie brought out his toolkit, 
removed the holoscan, set it for 
projection and dialed the record 
he wanted. Presently the scan the 
Wreave enforcer had captured 
through the jumpdoor danced in 
the air near the Palenki. McKie 
turned the projection slowly full 
circle, giving the Palenki a chance 
to see the face from every angle. 

“Is that Cheo?” he asked. 

“The scars present the identical 
pattern. It is the same one.” 
“That’s a valid identification,” 
McKie told Bildoon. “Palenkis 



120 



IF 




can identify random line patterns 
better than any other species in the 
universe.” 

“Our phyllum patterns are ex- 
tremely complex,” the Palenki 
boasted. 

“We know,” McKie said. 

“What good does this do us?” 
Bildoon asked. 

“I wish*I knew,” McKie said.

M CKIE and Tuluk were ar- 
guing about the Time-regen- 
eration theory, ignoring the squad 
of enforcers guarding them, al- 
though it was obvious their com- 
panions found the argument in- 
teresting. 

The theory was all over the Bu- 
reau by this time — about six hours 
after the session with Biredch of 
Ank. It had about as many scof- 
fers as it had supporters. 

At McKie’s insistence they had 
taken over one of the inter-species 
training rooms, set up a datascan 
console and were trying to square 
Tuluk’s theory with the subatomic 
alignment phenomenon discovered 
in the rawhide and other organic 
materials captured from Abnethe. 

Tuluk’s thought was that the 
alignment might point toward 
some spatial vector, giving a clue 
to Abnethe’s hideout. There must 
be some vector of focus in our di- 
mension,” Tuluk insisted. 

“Even if that’s true — what good 



would it do us?” McKie asked. 
“She’s not in our dimension. I say 
we go back to the Caleban’s — ” 
“You heard Bildoon. You don’t 
go anywhere. We leave the Beach- 
ball to enforcers while we concen- 
trate on — ” 

“But Fanny Mae’s our only 
source of new data.” 

“Fanny — oh, yes, the Caleban.” 
Tuluk was a pacer. He had 
staked out an oval route near the 
room’s instruction focus, tucked 
his mandibles neatly into the low- 
er fold of his facial slit and left 
only his eyes and breathing/ speech 
orifice exposed. The flexing bi- 
furcation that served him as legs 
carried him around a chairdog oc- 
cupied by McKie, thence to a 
point near a Laclac enforcer at one 
extreme of the instruction focus, 
thence back along a mixed line of 
enforcers who milled at a float- 
table on which McKie was dood- 
ling, thence around behind McKie 
and back over the same route. 

Bildoon entered, waved the pac- 
ing Wreave to a halt. 

“There’s a mob of newspeople 
outside,” he growled. “I don’t 
know where they got the story but 
it’s a good one. It can be described 
in a simple sentence: ‘Calebans 
linked to threatened end of uni- 
verse!’ McKie, did you have any- 
thing to do with this?” 

“Abenethe,” McKie said, not 
looking up from a complicated 
chalf doodle he was completing. 
“That’s crazy.”

“I never said she was sane. You 
know how many news services, 
’caster systems and other media 
she controls?” 

“Well — certainly. But — ” 

“Is anybody linking her to this 
threat?” 

“No.” 

“You don’t find that strange?” 
“How could any of these peo- 
ple know she — ” 

“How could they not know 
about Abnethe’s corner on Cale- 
bans?” McKie demanded. “Es- 
pecially after talkihg to you.” 

He stood up, hurled his chalf 
scribe to the floor, started up an 
aisle between rows of enforcers. 

“Wait,” Bildoon snapped. 
“Where are you going?” 

“To tell them about Abnethe.” 
“Are you out of your mind? 
That’s all she needs to tie us up— 
a slander and libel case.” 

“We can demand her appear- 
ance as accuser,” McKie said. 
“Should have thought about this 
earlier. We’re not thinking 
straight. Perfect defense — truth of 
accusation.” 

Bildoon caught up with him and 
they moved up the aisle in a pro- 
tective cordon of enforcers. Tuluk 
brought up the rear. 

“McKie,” Tuluk called, “you 
observe an inhibition of thought 
processes?” 

“Wait’ll I check your idea with 
Legal,” Bildoon said. “You may 
have something — ” 

“Save it,” McKie snapped. He 



stopped, turned to Bildoon. “How 
much more time do you figure we 
have?” 

“Who knows?” 

“Five minutes, maybe?” 

“Longer than that, surely.” 

“But you don’t know.” 

“I have enforcers at the Cale- 
ban’s — well, they’re keeping Ab- 
nethe’s attacks to a min — ” 

“You don’t want anything left 
to chance, right?” 

“Naturally.” 

“Well, I’m going to tell those 
newsies out there the — ” 

“McKie, that female has her 
tentacles into unsuspected areas of 
government,” Bildoon cautioned. 
“You’ve no idea. We’ve enough 
data to keep us busy for—” 

“Some really important powers 
are in with her, eh?” 

“There’s no doubt of it.” 

“And that’s why it’s time we 
took the wraps off.” 

“You’ll create a panic.” 

“We need a panic. A panic will 
set all sorts of sentients to trying 
to contact her — friends, associates, 
enemies, lunatics. We’ll be flooded 
with information. And we must 
develop new data.” 

“What if these illegitimates — ” 
Bildoon nodded toward the outer 
door — “refuse to believe you? 
They’ve heard you spout some pret- 
ty strange tales, McKie. What if 
they make fun of you?” 

M CKIE hesitated. He’d never 
before seen such ineffectual

maundering in Bildoon, a sentient 
noted for wit, brilliant insight, an- 
alytical adroitness. Was Bildoon 
one of those Abnethe had bought? 
Impossible. But the presence of an 
ego-frozen Pan Spechi in this sit- 
uation must have set up enormous 
traumatic shock waves among 
that species. And Bildoon was 
due for ego-collapse soon. What 
really happened in the Pan Spechi 
psyche as the moment neared for 
them to revert to the mindless 
creche-breeder form? Did it ignite 
an emotional frenzy of rejection? 
Did it inhibit thought? 

In a voice pitched only for Bil- 
doon’s ears McKie asked: “Are 
you ready to step down as Chief 
of Bureau?” 

“Of course not.” 

“We’ve known each other for 
a long time,” McKie whispered. 
“I think we understand and re- 
spect each other. You wouldn’t be 
in the king seat if I’d challenged 
you. You know that. Now — one 
friend to another: Are you func- 
tioning as well as you should in 
this crisis?” 

Angry contortions fled across 
Bildoon’ s face, were replaced by 
a thoughtful frown. 

McKie waited. When, it came 
the ego-shift would send Bildoon 
into shambling collapse. A new 
personality would step forth from 
Bildoon’s creche, a sentient know- 
ing everything Bildoon knew but 
profoundly different in emotional 
outlook. Had this present shock 



precipitated the crisis? McKie 
hoped not. He was genuinely fond 
of Bildoon. 

“What are you trying to do?” 
“I’m not trying to expose you to 
ridicule or speed up any — natural 
process,” McKie said. “But our 
present situation is too urgent. I’ll 
challenge you for the Bureau di- 
rectorship and throw everything 
into an uproar if you don’t an- 
swer truthfully.” 

“Am I functioning well?” Bil- 
doon mused. He shook his head. 
“You know the answer to that as 
well as I do. But you’ve a few 
lapses to explain as well, McKie.” 
“Haven’t we all?” 

“That’s it,” Tuluk said, stepping 
close to them. He glanced from 
Bildoon to McKie. “Forgive me — 
but we Wreaves have extremely 
acute hearing. I listened. But I 
must comment: The shock waves 
— or whatever we wish to call them 
— which accompanied the depar- 
ture of the Calebans and left be- 
hind such death and insanity that 
we must buffer ourselves with an - 
geret and other — ” 

“So our thought processes are 
mucked up,” Bildoon said. 

“More than that,” Tuluk said. 
“These vast occurrences have left 
reverberations. The news media 
will not laugh at McKie. All sen- 
tients grasp at , answers to the 
strange unrest we sense. ‘Period- 
ic Sentient Madness,’ it’s called 
and explanations are being sought

“We’re wasting time,” McKie 
said. 

“What would you have us do?” 
Bildoon asked. 

“Several things,” McKie said. 
“First, I want Steadyon quaran- 
tined, no access to the Beautybar- 
bers of any kind, no movement on 
or off the planet.” 

“That’s madness. What reason 
could we give?” 

“When does BuSab have to 
give reasons?” McKie asked. “We 
have a duty to slow the processes 
of government.” 

“You know what a delicate line 
we walk, McKie.” 

“The second thing,” McKie 
said, unperturbed, “will be to in- 
voke our emergency clause with 
the Taprisiots, get notification of 
every call made by every suspected 
friend or associate of Abnethe’s.” 



T HEY’LL say we’re trying to 
take over,” Bildoon breathed. 
“If this gets out there’ll be rebel- 
lion, physical violence. You know 
how jealously most sentients 
guard their privacy. Besides, the 
emergency clause wasn’t designed 
for this. It’s an identification and 
delay procedure within normal — ” 
“If we don’t do this we’ll die — 
and the Taprisiots with us,” McKie 
said. “That should be made clear 
to them. We need their willing co- 
operation.” 

“I don’t know if I can con- 
vince them,” Bildoon protested. 



“You’ll have to try.” 

“But what good will these ac- 
tions do us?” 

“Taprisiots and Beautybarbers 
all operate in some way similar to 
the Calebans but without as much 
— power,” McKie said. “I’m con- 
vinced of that. They’re all tapping 
the same power source with vary- 
ing effectiveness.” 

“Then what happens when we 
shut down the Beautybarbers?” 
“Abnethe won’t go very long 
without them.” 

“She probably has her own pla- 
toons of Beautybarbers.” 

“But Steadyon is their touch- 
stone. Quarantine it and I think 
Beautybarber activity will stop 
everywhere.” 

Bildoon looked at Tuluk. 
“Taprisiots understand more 
than they’ve indicated about con- 
nectives,” Tuluk said. “I think 
they will listen to you if you point 
out that our last remaining Cale- 
ban is about to enter ultimate dis- 
continuity. I think they’ll realize 
the significance of this.” 

“Explain the significance to me, 
if you don’t mind. If Taprisiots 
can use these — these — They must 
know how to avoid the disaster.” 
“Has anybody asked them?” 
“Beautybarbers. Taprisiots,’’ 
Bildoon muttered. “What else do 
you have in mind?” 

“I’m going back to the Beach- 
ball,” McKie said. 

“We can’t protect you as well 
there.” 



124 



IF 




“I know.” 

“That room’s too small. If the 
Caleban would come to — ” 

“She won’t move. I’ve asked.” 

Bildoon sighed as a human 
might have. The Pan Spechi had 
absorbed more than shape when 
they had decided to copy the hu- 
man pattern. The differences, 
though, were profound, and Mc- 
Kie reminded himself of this. Hu- 
mans could only see dimly into 
Pan Spechi thoughts. With creche- 
reversion imminent for this proud 
sentient — what was he truly think- 
ing? A creche mate would come 
forth presently, a new personality 
with all the Bildoon creche’s mil- 
lennial accumulation of data. 

McKie pursed his lips, inhaled, 
blew out. 

How did Pan Spechi transfer 
that data from one unit to another? 
They were always linked, they 
said, ego holder and creche mates, 
dormant and active, slavering 
flesheater and thinking esthete. 
Linked? How? 

“Do you understand connec- 
tives?” McKie asked, staring into 
Bildoon’s faceted eyes. 

“I see the way your thoughts 
wander.” 

“Well?” 

“Perhaps we Pan Spechi share 
this power,” Bildoon said. “But 
if so, the sharing is entirely un- 
conscious. I will say no more. You 
come close to invasion of creche 
privacy.” 

McKie nodded. Creche privacy 



was the ultimate defensive citadel 
of Pan Spechi existence. They 
would kill to defend it. No logic 
or reason could prevent the auto- 
matic reaction once it was igniled. 
Bildoon had displayed great 
friendship in issuing his warning. 

“We’re desperate,” McKie 
said. 

“I agree,” Bildoon said, over- 
tones of profound dignity in his 
voice. “You may proceed as you’ve 
indicated.” 

“Thanks,”‘McKie said. 

“It’s on your head, McKie,” 
Bildoon added. 

“Provided I can keep my head,” 
McKie said. He opened the outer 
door onto a clamor of newspeople. 
They were being held back by a 
harried line of enforcers and it 
occurred to McKie, grasping this 
scene in its first impact, that all 
those involved in this turmoil were 
vulnerable. 

C ROWDS already were form- 
ing on the morning-lighted 
palisades above the Beachball when 
McKie arrived. 

News traveled fast, he thought. 
Extra squads of enforcers, called 
in anticipation of this mob scene, 
held back sentients trying to get to 
the cliff’s edge, barred access to the 
lava shelf. Aircraft of many kinds 
were being blocked by a screen of 
BuSab fliers. 

McKie, standing near the 
Beachball, looked up at the hectic 
activity. The morning wind carried 



WHIPPING STAR 



125 




a fine mist of sea spray against his 
cheek. He had taken a jumpdoor 
to Furuneo’s headquarters, left in- 
structions there and used a Bureau 
flier for the short trip to the lava 
shelf. 

The Beachball’s port remained 
open, he noted. Mixed squads of 
enforcers milled about in a con- 
fused pattern around the Ball, alert 
to every quarter of their surround- 
ings. Picked enforcers watched 
through the port where others 
shared their uneasy guardianship. 

It was quite early in Cordiality’s 
day here but real-time relationships 
confused such arbitrary time sys- 
tems. It was night at Central’s 
headqurters, evening at the 
Taprisiot Council Building where 
Bildoon must still be arguing — 
and only Immutable Space knew 
what time it was where Abnethe 
had her base of operations. 

Later than any of them think . 

McKie shouldered his way 
through the enforcers, got a boost 
up through the port and surveyed 
the familiar purple gloom inside 
the Beachball. It was noticeably 
warmer in here out of the wind 
and spray but not as warm as Mc- 
Kie remembered the place. 

“Has the Caleban been talk- 
ing?” McKie asked a Laclac, one 
of the enforcers guarding the in- 
terior. 

“I don’t call it talking but the 
answer is — not recently.” 

“Fanny Mae,” McKie said. 

Silence. 



“You still there, Fanny Mae?” 
McKie asked. 

McKie? You invoke presence , 
McKie? 

McKie felt he’d registered the 
words on his eyeballs and relayed 
them to his hearing centers. The 
communication was definitely 
weaker than he remembered. 

“How many floggings has she 
undergone in the past day?” Mc- 
Kie asked the Laclac. 

“Local day?” the Laclac asked. 

“What difference does it make?” 

“I presumed you were asking 
for accurate data.” 

“I’m trying to find out if 
she’s been under attack recently,” 
McKie said. “She sounds weaker 
than when I was here before.” He 
stared toward the giant spoon 
where the Caleban maintained her 
unpresence. 

“Attacks have been intermittent 
and sporadic but not very success- 
ful,” the Laclac said. “We’ve col- 
lected more whips and Palenki 
arms, although I understand 
they’re not being successfully 
transmitted to the lab.” 

McKie invokes presence oj 
Caleban self called Fanny Mae? 
the Caleban asked. 

“I greet you, Fanny Mae,” Mc- 
Kie said. 

You possess new connective en- 
tanglements , McKie, bilt the pat- 
tern oj you retains recognition. I 
greet you, McKie. 

“Does your contract with Ab- 
nethe still lead us all toward ulti-

IF 




mate discontinuity?” McKie 
asked. 

Intensity of nearness , the Cale- 
ban said. My employer wishes 
speech with you. 

“Abnethe? She wants to talk to 
me?” 

Correct. 

“She could have called me any 
time,” McKie said. 

Abnethe conveys request 
through self of me. She asks relay 
along anticipated connective. This 
connective you perceive under 
label of “ Now . ” You hang this?” 

“I hang it,” McKie growled. 
“So let her talk.” 

Abnethe requires you send com- 
panions from presence. 

McKie demanded, “What 
makes her think I’d do such a 
thing?” 

It was getting hotter in the 
Beachball. He wiped perspiration 
from his upper lip. 

Abnethe speaks of sentient mo- 
tive called curiosity. 

“I’ve my own conditions for a 
conference,” McKie said. “Tell 
her I won’t agree unless I’m as- 
sured she’ll make no attack on you 
or on me during our talk.” 

I give such assurance. 

“You give it?” 

Probability in Abnethe assur- 
ance appears incomplete. Approx- 
imate descriptive. Assurance by 
self runs intense , strong. Direct? 
Perhaps. 

“Why do you give this assur- 
ance?” 



Employer Abnethe indicates 
strong desire for talk. Contract 
covers such — catering? Very close 
term. Catering. 

“You guarantee our safety, is 
that it?” 

Intense assurance, no more. 

“No attack during our talk,” 
McKie insisted. 

Thus propels connective , the 
Caleban said. 

Behind McKie the Laclac en- 
forcer grunted, said, “Do you un- 
derstand that gibberish?” 

“Take your squad and get out of 
here,” McKie said. 

“Ser, my orders — ” 

“Deface your orders! I’m acting 
under the cartouche of Saboteur 
Extraordinary with full discretion 
from the Bureau Chief himself. Get 
out.” 

“Ser,” the Laclac said, “during 
the most recent flogging nine en- 
forcers went mad here despite in- 
gestion of angeret and various 
other chemicals we believed would 
protect us. I cannot be responsible 
for — ” 

“You’ll be responsible for a tide 
station on the nearest desert planet 
if you don’t obey me at once,” 
McKie said. “I will see you packed 
off to boredom after an official 
trial.” 

“I will not heed your threats, 
Ser,” the Laclac said. “However, 
I will consult Bildoon himself if 
you so order.” 

“Consult then, and hurry it. 
There’s a Taprisiot outside.”

“Very well.” The Laclac sa- 
luted, crawled out. His compan- 
ions in the Beachball continued 
their restive watch. 

They were brave sentients, all of 
them, McKie thought, to continue 
this duty in face of the known per- 
il. 

Presently, the Laclac reappeared 
in the port, said. “Ser, I am in- 
structed to obey your orders but to 
remain outside in visual contact 
with you, returning to this place at 
the first sign of trouble.” 

“If that’s the best we can do, 
that’s it,” McKie said. “Get mov- 
ing.” 

I N A moment McKie found him- 
self alone with the Caleban. The 
sense that every place in this room 
lay behind him persisted. His spine 
itched. He felt increasingly that he 
was taking too much of a risk. 

But there was the desperation of 
their position. 

“Where’s Abnethe?” McKie 
asked. “I thought she wanted to 
talk.” 

A jumpdoor opened abruptly to 
the left of the Caleban’s spoon. 
Abnethe’ s head and shoulders ap- 
peared in it, all subtly pink-hazed 
by the slowdown of energy within 
that portal. The light was suffi- 
cient, though, for McKie to see 
subtle changes in Abnethe’s ap- 
pearance. He was gratified to note 
a harried look to her. Wisps of 
hair escaped her tight coiffure. 
Bloodshot veins could be detected 



in her eyes. Her forehead was wrin- 
kled. 

She needed her Beautybarbers. 

“Are you ready to give yourself 
up?” McKie asked. 

“That’s a stupid question,” she 
said. “You’re alone at my com- 
mand.” 

“Not quite alone,” McKie said. 

A sly smile formed on Abnethe’s 
lips. 

“You’ll note that Fanny Mae 
has closed the exterior port of her 
residence.” 

McKie shot a glance to his left, 
saw that the port was closed. 
Treachery? 

“Fanny Mae, you promised — ” 

No attack , the Caleban said. 
Privacy. 

McKie imagined the consterna- 
tion in the enforcers outside right 
now. But they would never be able 
to break into the Beachball. He 
saved his protests, swallowed. The 
room remained utterly still. 

“Privacy, then,” he agreed. 

“That’s better,” Abnethe said. 
“We must reach agreement, Mc- 
Kie. You’re becoming somewhat 
of a nuisance.” 

“Oh, more than a nuisance, cer- 
tainly.” 

“Perhaps.” 

“Your Palenki, the one who was 
going to chop me up — I found him 
a nuisance, too. Maybe even more 
than a nuisance. Now that I think 
about it, I recall that I suffered.” 

Abnethe shuddered. 

“By the way,” McKie said, “we 



128 



IF 




know where you are.” 

“You lie — ” 

“Not really. You see, you’re not 
where you think you are, Mliss. 
You think you’ve gone back in 
Time. You haven’t.” 

“You lie, I say!” 

“I have it pretty well figured 
out. The place where you are was 
constructed from your connectives 
— your memories, dreams, wishes 
— perhaps even from things^ you 
expressly described.” 

“What nonsense — ” 

“You asked for a place that 
would be safe from the apoca- 
lypse,” McKie said. “Fanny Mae 
warned you about ultimate discon- 
tinuity, of course. She probably 
demonstrated some of her powers, 
showed you various places avail- 
able to you along the connectives 
of you and your associates. That’s 
when you got your big idea.” 

“You’re guessing,’’ Abnethe 
said. 

Her face was grim. McKie 
smiled. 

“You could stand a little session 
with your Beautybarbers,” he said. 
“You’re looking a bit seedy, 
Mliss.” 

She scowled. 

“Are they refusing to work for 
you?” McKie persisted. 

“They’ll come around.” 
“When?” 

“When they see they’ve no al- 
ternative.” 

“Perhaps.” 

“We’re wasting time, McKie.” 



“That’s true. What was it you 
wanted to say to me?” 

“We must make an agreement, 
McKie. Just the two of us.” 

“You’ll marry me, is that it?” 
“That’s your price?” 

“I’m not sure,” McKie said. 
“What about Cheo?” 

“Cheo begins to bore me.” 

“That worries me,” McKie said. 
“I ask myself — how long before I 
bore you?” 

“I realize you’re not being sin- 
cere,” she said, “that you’re stall- 
ing. I think, however, we can reach 
agreement.” 

“What makes you think so?” 
“Fanny Mae suggested it.” 
McKie peered at the shimmering 
unpresence of the Caleban. 

“Fanny Mae suggested it?” he 
murmured. 

And he thought: Fanny Mae de- 
termines her own brand of reality 
from what she sees of these mys- 
terious connectives. Refined dif- 
ferences — connectives — tangled 
connectives — a special perception 
tailored to her particular energy 
consumption . 

S WEAT dripped from his fore- 
head. He rocked forward, sens- 
ing that he stood on the brink of a 
revelation. 

“Do you still love me, Fanny 
Mae?” he asked. 

Abnethe’s eyes went wide with 
surprise. 

“What?” 



WHIPPING STAR 



129 




Affinity awareness , the Caleban 
said. Love equates with this co- 
herence / possess of you, McKie. 

“How do you savor my single- 
track existence?” McKie asked. 

Intense affinity, the Caleban 
said. Product of sincerity of at- 
tempts at communication. I -self - 
Caleban love you human-person, 
McKie. 

Abnethe glared at McKie. “I 
came here to discuss a mutual 
problem, McKie,” she flared. “I 
did not anticipate standing aside 
for a gibberish session between 
you and this stupid Caleban.” 

Self not in stupor, the Caleban 
said. 

“McKie.” Abnethe’s voice was 
low. “I came to suggest a propo- 
sition of mutual benefit. Join me. 
I don’t care what capacity you 
choose. The rewards will be more 
than you could possibly — ” 

“You don’t even suspect what’s 
happened to you,” McKie said. 
“That’s the strange thing.” 

“Damn you, I could make an 
emperor out of you.” 

“Don’t you realize where Fanny 
Mae has hidden you?” McKie 
asked. “Don’t you recognize this 
safe—” 

“Mliss!” 

An angry voice came from 
somewhere behind Abnethe. The 
speaker was not visible to McKie. 

“Is that you, Cheo?” McKie 
called. “Do you know where you 
are, Cheo? A Pan Spechi must sus- 
pect the truth.” 



A hand came into view, yanked 
Abnethe aside. The ego-frozen Pan 
Spechi took her place in the jump- 
door opening. 

“You’re much too clever, Mc- 
Kie,” Cheo said. 

“How dare you, Cheo!” Ab- 
nethe screamed. 

Cheo whirled, swung an arm. 
There was the sound of flesh hit- 
ting flesh, a stifled scream, another 
blow. Cheo bent away from the 
opening, came back into view. 

“You’ve been in that place be- 
fore, haven’t you, Cheo?” McKie 
asked. “Weren’t you a mewling, 
empty-minded female in the creche 
at one period of your existence?” 

“Much too clever,” Cheo 
snarled. 

“You’ll have to kill her, you 
know,” McKie said. “If you don’t, 
it’ll all be for nothing. She’ll digest 
you. She'll take over your ego. 
She’ll be you.” 

“I didn’t know this happened 
with humans,” Cheo said. 

“Oh, it happens,” McKie said. 
“That’s her world, isn’t it, Cheo?” 

“Her world,” Cheo agreed. 
“But you’re mistaken about one 
thing, McKie. I can control Mliss. 
So it’s my world, isn’t it? And 
another thing— I can control you.” 

The jumpdoor’s vortal tube sud- 
denly grew smaller, darted at Mc- 
Kie. 

McKie dodged aside, shouted, 
“Fanny Mae—” 

New connectives, the Caleban 
said.

IF 




McKie executed a sprawling 
dive across the room as the jump- 
door appeared beside him. It nip- 
ped into existence and out like a 
ravening mouth, narrowly missing 
McKie. He twisted, leaped — 
dodged panting through the Beach- 
ball’s purple gloom, rolled finally 
under the giant spoon, peered right 
and left. He shuddered. He hadn’t 
realized a jumpdoor could be 
moved around so rapidly. 

“Fanny Mae,” he rasped, “shut 
off the S’eye, close it down. You 
promised— no attack!” 

No response. 

McKie glimpsed an edge of the 
vortal tube hovering just beyond 
the spoon bowl. 

“McKie.” Cheo’s voice. 
“They’ll call you long distance 
in a minute. When they do. I’ll 
have you.” 

McKie stilled a fit of trembling. 

They would call him. Bildoon 
probably had summoned a Tapris- 
iot already. They would be worry- 
ing about him — and he would be 
helpless in the grip of the call. 

“Fanny Mae,” McKie yelled. 
“Close that damn’ S’eye.” 

The vortal tube glittered, shifted 
up and around to come at him 
from the side. Cursing, McKie 
rolled into a ball, kicked backward 
and over onto his knees, leaped to 
his feet and flung himself across 
the spoon handle, scrambled back 
under it. 

The searching tube moved away. 

A low crackling came, deep- 



ened to thunder. He glanced right, 
left, back over his head. There was 
no sign of the deadly opening. 

Something snapped sharply 
above the spoon bowl. A shower of 
green sparks cascaded around Mc- 
Kie. He rolled, brought up his ray- 
gen. A Palenki arm and whip had 
been thrust through the jump- 
door’s opening. It was raised to 
deliver another blow against the 
Caleban. 

McKie sprayed the raygen’s 
beam across the arm as the whip 
moved. Arm and whip grazed the 
far edge of the spoon, brought an- 
other shower of sparks. 

The jumpdoor winked out of ex- 
istence. 

M CKIE crouched, the after 
image of the sparks still danc- 
ing on his retinas. Now he recalled 
what he had been trying to remem- 
ber since watching Tuluk’s experi- 
ment with the steel. 

S' eye removed, Fanny Mae said. 
Fanny Mae’s voice fell on Mc- 
Kie’s forehead, seemed to seep in- 
ward to his speech centers. She 
sounded weak. ^ 

Slowly McKie lifted himself to 
his feet. The Palenki arm and whip 
lay on the floor. He ignored them. 
Shower of sparks . 

McKie felt strange emotions 
washing through him, around him. 
He felt happily angry, satiated with 
frustrations, words and phrases 
tumbling through his mind like 
pinwheels.

That perverted offspring of an 
indecent union. 

Shower of sparks — shower of 
sparks. 

He knew he had to hold that 
thought and his sanity no matter 
what the surgiiTg waves of emotion 
from Fanny Mae did to him. 

Shower of — shower — 

Was Fanny Mae dying? 

“Fanny Mae?” 

The Caleban remained silent but 
the emotional onslaught eased. 

McKie knew there was some- 
thing he had to remember. It con- 
cerned Tuluk. He had to tell 
Tuluk. 

Shower of sparks. 

He had it then. 

The pattern that identifies the 
maker — a shower of sparks. 

He felt he’d been running for 
hours, that his nerves were bruised 
and tangled. His mind was a bowl 
of jelly. Thoughts quivered through 
it. His brain was going to melt and 
run away like a stream of colored 
fluid. It would spray out of him in 
a shower. 

Shower of — of — sparks. 

He called, “Fanny Mae?” 

A peculiar silence rippled 
through the Beachball. It was an 
emotionless silence, something 
shut off, removed. It made McKie’s 
skin prickle. 

“Answer me, Fanny Mae,” he 
said. 

S’eye absents itself, the Caleban 
said. 

McKie felt shame, a deep and 




possessive sense of guilt. It flowed 
over him and through him, filled 
every cell —dirty, muddy, sinful, 
shameful. 

He shook his head. Why should 
he feel guilt? 

Ah. Realization came over him. 
The emotion came from outside 
him — from Fanny Mae. 

“Fanny Mae,” he said, “I un- 
derstand you could not prevent 
that attack. I don’t blame you. I 
understand.” 

Surprise connectives, the Cale- 
ban said. You overstand. 

“I understand.” 

Overstand? Term for intensity 
of knowledge? Realization? 

“Realization, yes.” 

Calmness returned to McKie. It 
was the calmness of something be- 
ing withdrawn. 

Again he reminded himself that 
he had a vital message forTuluk. 

Shower of sparks. 

But first he had to be certain that 
mad Pan Spechi was not going to 
return momentarily. 

“Fanny Mae,” he said, “can you 
prevent their from using the 
Scye?” 

Ohstru , rive, not preventive, the 
Caleban said. 

“You mean you can slow them 
down?" 

Explain slow. 

“Oh, no/* McKie moaned. He 
cast around in his mind for a Cale- 
ban way to phrase his question. 
How would 1 anny Mae say it? 

“The next attack, will it be on a 



short connective or long one?” 

Attack series breaks here. You 
inquire of duration by your time 
sense. / overstand this. Long line 
across attack nodes — this equates 
with more intense duration for 
your time sense. 

“Intense duration,” McKie 
muttered. “Yeah.” 

Shower of sparks. 

You signify employment of 
S' eye by Cheo, the Caleban said. 
Spacing extends at this place. Cheo 
goes farther down your track. I 
overstand intensely for McKie. 
Yes? 

Farther down my track, McKie 
thought. He gulped as realization 
hit him. What had Fanny Mae said 
earlier? 

See us to the door! I am S' eye! 

He breathed softly lest sudden 
motion dislodge this brutal clarity 
of understanding. 

Overstanding. 

He thought of energy require- 
ments. Fnormous. I am S'eye! 
and: Self energy - by being stellar 
mass! To do what they did in this 
dimension Caleban's required the 
energy of a stellar mass. She in- 
haled the whip. She said it her- 
self they sought energy here. The 
Calebans fed in this dimension. 

McKie considered the refined 
discrimination Fanny Mae must 
possess even to attempt communi- 
cation with him. It would be as 
though he immersed his mouth in 
water and tried to talk to a single 
micro-organism there. 



134 



IF 




“We have to go right back to the 
beginning,” he said. 

Many beginnings exist for each 
entity , the Caleban said. 

McKie sighed. 

Sighing, he was seized by a Tap- 
risiot contact. 

Bildoon. 

“I’m glad you waited,” McKie 
said, cutting off Bildoon’s first* 
anxious inquiries. “Here’s what I 
want you to—” 

“McKie, what’s going on 
there?” Bildoon insisted. “There 
are dead enforcers all around you, 
madmen, a riot — ” 

“I seem to be immune,” McKie 
said, “or else Fanny Mae is pro- 
tecting me some way. Now listen 
to me. We don’t have much time. 
Get Tuluk. He has a device for 
identifying the patterns that orig- 
inate in the stress of creation. He’s 
to bring that device here — right 
here to the Beachball. And fast.” 

XIII 

I N THE hushed stillness within 
the Beachball McKie leaned 
against a curved wall, sipped ice- 
water from a fhermocup. He 
watched Tuluk set up the needed 
instruments. 

“What’s to prevent our being 
attacked while we work?” Tuluk 
asked. He rolled a glowing loop 
on a squat stand into position near 
the Caleban’s unpresence. “You 
should have let Bildoon send in 
some guards.” 



“Like those who were foaming 
at the mouth outside?” 

“There’s a fresh crew outside 
there now.” 

Tuluk did something that made 
the glowing loop double its diam- 
eter. 

“They’d only get in the way,” 
McKie said. “Besides, Fanny Mae 
says the spacing isn’t right for Ab- 
nethe.” He sipped ice water. The 
Ball had achieved something ap- 
proaching sauna temperature but 
without the humidity. 

“Spacing,” Tuluk said. “Is that 
why Abnethe keeps missing you?” 
He produced a black wand from 
his instrument case. The wand was 
about a meter long. He adjusted a 
knob on its handle and the glowing 
loop contracted. The squat stand 
beneath the loop began to hum — 
an itch-producing middle-C. 

“They miss me because I have a 
loving protector,” McKie said. “It 
isn’t every sentient who can say a 
Caleban loves him.” 

“What is that you’re drinking?” 
Tuluk asked. “Is that one of your 
mind disrupters?” 

“You’re very funny,” McKie 
said. “How much longer are you 
going to fiddle with that gear?” 

“I am not fiddling. Don’t you 
realize this isn’t portable equip- 
ment? It must be adjusted.” 

“So adjust.” 

“The high temperature in here 
complicates my readings,” Tuluk 
complained. “Why can’t we have 
the port open?” 



WHIPPING STAR 



135 




“For the same reason I didn’t 
let any guards in here. I’ll take my 
chances without having them com- 
plicated by a mob of insane sen- 
tients getting in my way.” 

“But must it be this hot?” 

“Can't be helped,” McKie said. 
“Fanny Mae and I have been talk- 
ing, working things out.” 

“Talking?” 

“Flot air,” McKie said. 

“Ah, you make a joke.” 

“It can happen to anyone,’*’ 
McKie said. “I keep asking myself 
if what we see as a star is all of a 
Caleban of just part of one. I opt 
for part.” 

He drank deeply of the ice wa- 
ter, discovered there was no more 
ice in it. Tuluk was right. It 
was damnably hot in here. 

“That’s a strange theory,” Tul- 
uk said. 

He silenced the humming of his 
instrument case. In the abrupt still- 
ness, something else in the case 
could be heard ticking. It was not 
a peaceful sound. It had the feel- 
ing of a timing device affixed to a 
bomb. It counted moments in a 
deadly race. 

“There,” Tuluk said. 

“You ready?” McKie asked. 

“I will be ready presently. Why 
does the Caleban not speak?” 

“Because I asked her to save her 
strength.” 

“What does she say of your the- 
ory?” 

“She thinks I have achieved 
truth.” 



Tuluk took a small helix from 
his instrument case, inserted it in- 
to a receptacle at the base of the 
glowing ring. 

“Come on, come on,” McKie 
jittered. 

“Your urgings will not reduce 
the necessary time for this task,” 
Tuluk said. “For example, I am 
hungry. I came without stopping 
to break my daily fast. This does 
not press me to a speed that might 
produce errors, nor does it arouse 
me to complaint.” 

“Aren’t you complaining?” 
McKie asked. “You want some of 
my water?” 

“I had water two days ago,” 
Tuluk said. 

“And we wouldn’t want to rush 
you «ito another drink.” 

“I do not understand what pat- 
tern you hope to identify,” Tuluk 
said. “We have no records of arti- 
sans for a Comparison of — ” 

“This is something God made,” 
McKie said. 

“You should not jest about 
deities,” Tuluk said. 

“Are you a believer or just play- 
ing safe?” McKie asked. 

“I was chiding you for an act 
that might offend some sentients,” 
Tuluk said. “We have a hard 
enough time bridging the sentient 
barriers without raising religious 
issues.” 

“Well, we’ve been spying on 
God— or whatever — for a long 
time,” McKie said. “That’s why 
we’re going to get a spectroscopic 



136 



IF 




record of this. How much longer 
you going to be at this fiddling?" 

“Patience, patience," Tuluk 
muttered. 

He reactivated the wand, waved 
it near the glowing ring. Again, the 
instrument began humming, a 
higher note this time. It grated on 
McKie's nerves. He felt it in his 
teeth and along the skin of his 
shoulders. It itched inside him 
where he couldn’t scratch. 

“Damn this heat!" Tuluk said. 
“Why will you not have the Cale- 
ban open a door to thfe outside?" 

“I told you why." 

“Well, it doesn’t make this task 
any easier!" 

“You know,’’ McKie said, 
“when you called me and saved my 
skin from that Palenki chopper — 
the first time, remember? Right 
afterward you said you’d been tan- 
gled with Fanny Mae and you said 
a very odd thing. 

“Oh?" Tuluk had extended a 
small mandible and was making 
delicate adjustments to a knob on 
the case below the glowing ring. 

“You said something about not 
knowing that was where you lived s 
Remember that?" 

“I will never forget it." Tuluk 
bent his tubular body across the 
glowing ring, stared back through 
it while passing the. wand back 
and forth in front of the ring’s 
opening. 

“Where was that?" McKie 
asked. 

“Where was what?" 



“Where you lived." 

“That? There are no words to 
describe it." 

“Try." 

Tuluk straightened, glanced at 
McKie. “It was a bit like being a 
mote in a vast sea and experiencing 
the warmth, the friendship of a 
benign giant." 

“That giant the Caleban?" 

“Of course." 

“That’s what I thought." 

“I will not answer for inaccura- 
cies in this device," Tuluk said. 
“But I don’t believe I can adjust it 
any closer. Given a few days, some 
shielding — there’s an odd radia- 
tion pattern from that wall behind 
you and projection dampers, I 
mijght, I just might achieve a fair 
degree of accuracy. Now? I cannot 
be responsible." 

“And you’ll be able to get a 
spectroscopic record?" 

“Oh, yes." 

“Then maybe we’re in time," 
McKie said. 

“For what? 1 " 

“For the right spacing." 

, “Ah, you mean the flogging and 
the subsequent shower of sparks?" 

“That’s what I mean." 

“You could not flog her your- 
self, gently?" 

“Fanny Mae says that wouldn't 
work. It has to be done with vio- 
lence and the intent to create in- 
tensity of anti-love or it won't 
work." 

“Oh. How odd. You know, 
McKie, I believe I could use some 



WHIPPING STAR

of your water after all. It’s the heat 
in here.” 

T HERE was a popping sound, 
a stopper being pulled from a 
bottle. Air pressure dropped slight- 
ly in the Beachball and McKie 
experienced the panic notion that 
Abnethe had somehow opened 
them onto a vacuum that would 
drain away their air and kill them. 
The physicists said this couldn’t be 
done, that the gas flow, impeded 
by the adjustment barrier within 
the jumpdoor, would block the 
opening with its own collision 
breakdown. McKie suspected, 
though, that the physicists did not 
know everything they pretended to 
know about S’eye phenomena. 

He missed the jumpdoor’s vortal 
tube at first. Its plane was horizon- 
tal and directly above the Cale- 
ban’s spoon bowl. 

A Palenki arm and whip shot 
through the opening, delivered a 
lashing blow to the area occupied 
by the Caleban’s unpresence. 
Green sparks showered the air. 

Tuluk, bending over his instru- 
ments, muttered excitedly. 

The Palenki arm drew back, 
hesitated. 

“Again — again.’’ 

The voice through the jumpdoor 
was unmistakably that of Cheo. 

The Palenki delivered another 
blow and another. 

McKie lifted his raygen, dividing 
his attention between Tuluk and 
that punishing whip. Did Tuluk 



have his readings? No telling how 
much more of this the Caleban 
could survive. 

Again the whip lashed. Green 
sparks glimmered and fell. 

“Tuluk, do you have enough 
data?’’ McKie demanded. 

Arm and whip jerked back 
through the jumpdoor. 

A curious silence settled over 
the room. 

“Tuluk?’’ McKie hissed. 

“I believe I have it,’’ Tuluk said. 
“It’s a good recording. I will not 
vouch for comparison and identi- 
fication, however.’’ 

McKie grew aware that the 
room wasn’t really silent. The 
thrumming of Tuluk’s instruments 
formed a background for a mur- 
mur of voices coming through the 
jumpdoor. 

“Abnethe?’’ McKie called. 

The opening tipped, gave him a 
three-quarter view ^of Abnethe’ s 
face. There was a purple bruise 
from her left temple down across 
her cheek. A silver noose held her 
throat, its end firmly in the grip of 
a Pan Spechi hand. 

Abnethe, McKie saw, was trying 
to control* a rage which threatened 
to burst her veins. Her face was al- 
ternately pale and flushed. She 
held her mouth tight, lips in a thin 
line. Compressed violence radiated 
from $very pore. 

She saw McKie. 

“See what you’ve done?’’ she 
shrieked. 

McKie pushed himself away 



138 



IF 




from the wall, fascinated. He ap- 
proached the jumpdoor. 

“What I did? That looks more 
like Cheo’s handiwork.” 

“It’s all your fault.” 

“Oh? That was clever of me.” 

“I tried to be reasonable,” she 
rasped. “I tried to help you, save 
you. But no — you treated me like 
a criminal. This is the thanks I got 
from you.” 

She gestured at the noose 
around her throat. 

“What did I do to deserve this?” 
“Cheo’s voice came from a point 
beyond the arm gripping the noose. 
“Tell him, Mliss.” 

Tuluk, who had been ignoring 
the exchange, busying himself with 
his instruments, turned to McKie. 

“Remarkable,” he said. “Truly 
remarkable.” 

“Tell him.” Cheo insisted as Ab- 
nethe held a stubborn silence. 

Both Abnethe and Tuluk began 
talking at once. It came through to 
McKie as a mixed jumble of 
noises. 

“Youinterstellferederhydrowith- 
genlawmassfulexecufrom— ” 

“Shut up!” McKie shouted. 
Abnethe jerked back, shocked to 
silence, but Tuluk went right on: 
“ and that makes it quite certain 
there’s no mistaking the spectral 
absorption pattern. It’s a star, all 
right. Nothing else would give us 
the same picture.” 

“But which star?” McKie asked. 
“Ahh, that’s the question,” Tul- 
uk said. 



Cheo pushed Abnethe aside, 
took her place in the jumpdoor. He 
glanced at Tuluk, at the instru- 
ments. “What’s all this, McKie? 
Another way to interfere with our 
Palenkis? Or did you come back 
for a new game of ring around 
your neck?” 

“We’ve discovered something 
you might like to know,” McKie 
said. 

“What could you discover that 
would possibly interest me?” 

“Tell him, Tuluk,” McKie said. 

“Fanny Mae exists somehow in 
intimate association with a stellar 
mass,” Tuluk said. “She may even 
be a stellar mass — at least as far as 
our dimension is concerned.” 

Not dimension, the Caleban 
said. Wave. 

H ER voice barely reached 
McKie's awareness but the 
words were accompanied by a rol- 
ling surge of misery that rocked 
him and set Tuluk to shuddering. 

“Wha-wha-what w-w-was th-th- 
that?” Tuluk managed. 

“Easy, easy,” McKie cautioned. 
He saw that Cheo had not been 
touched by that sea of emotion. At 
least, the Pan Spechi remained 
impassive. 

“We'll have Fanny Mae identi- 
fied shortly,” McKie said. 

Identity . the Caleban said, her 
communication coming through 
with more strength but with an icy 
withdrawal for emotion, refers to 
unique self-understanding quality 



WHIPPING STAR 



139 




as it deals with self- label, self- 
abode and self-manifestations. 
You not me hang yet, McKie. You 
hang term yet ? Self-I overstand 
your Time node. 

“Hang?” Cheo asked, jerking 
the noose around Abnethe's neck. 

“A simple old-fashioned idi- 
om,” McKie said. “I imagine 
Mliss gets the hang of it.” 

“What are you talking about?” 
Cheo asked. 

Tuluk took the question as hav- 
ing been directed to him. 

“In some way,” he said, “Cale- 
bans manifest themselves in our 
universe as stars. Every star has a 
pulse, a certain unique rhythm, a 
never-duplicated identity. We have 
Fanny Mae’s pattern recorded 
now. We’re going to run a tracer 
on that pattern and try to identify 
her as a star.” 

“A stupid theory like that is sup- 
posed to interest me?” Cheo de- 
manded. 

“It had better interest you,” 
McKie said. “It’s more than a the- 
ory now. You think you’re sitting 
in a safe hidey-hole. All you have 
to do is eliminate Fanny Mae — 
that’s supposed to eliminate our 
universe and leave you out there 
the only sentients anywhere? Is 
that it?” 

“Calebans don’t lie,” Cheo 
snarled. 

“But I think they can make mis- 
takes,” McKie said. 

Proliferation of single-tracks, 
the Caleban said. 



McKie shuddered at the icy 
wave that accompanied the words. 

“If we discontinue, will Abnethe 
and her friends still exist?” he 
asked. 

Different patterns with short 
limit on extended connectives, the 
Caleban said. 

McKie felt the ice invade his 
stomach. He saw that Tuluk was 
trembling, facial slit opening and 
closing. 

“That was plain enough, wasn’t 
it?” McKie asked. “You’ll change 
somehow and you won’t live very 
long after us.” 

No branchings, the Caleban 
said. 

“No offspring,” McKie trans- 
lated. 

“This is a trick,” Cheo snarled. 
“She’s lying.” 

“Caleban’s don’t lie,” McKie 
reminded him. 

“But they can make mistakes.” 

“The right kind of mistake 
could ruin everything for you,” 
McKie said. 

“I’ll take my chances,” Cheo 
said. “And you can take — ” 

The jumpdoo^ winked out of ex- 
istence. x

Caleban said. You hang difficult? 
More intense energy requirement 
reference. You hang? 

“I understand,” McKie said. 

He mopped his forehead with a 
sleeve. 

Tuluk extended his long mandi- 
ble, waved it agitatedly.

IF 




“Cold,” he said. “Cold-cold- 
cold-cold.” 

“I think she’s holding on by a 
thin thread,” McKie said. 

Tuluk’s torso rippled as he in- 
haled deeply into his outer trio of 
lungs. 

“Shall we take our records back 
to the lab?” he asked. 

“A stellar mass,” McKie mut- 
tered. “Imagine it. And all we see 
here is this — this bit of nothing.” 

Not put something here, the Cal- 
eban said. Self-I put something 
here and uncreate you. McKie dis- 
continues in presence of I-self. 

“Do you hang that, Tuluk?” 
McKie asked. 

“Hang? Oh, yes. She seems to be 
saying that she can’t make herself 
visible to us because that’d kill us.” 

“That’s the way I read it,” 
McKie said. “Let’s get back and 
start that comparison search.” 

You expend substance without 
purpose, theCaleban said. 

“What now?” McKie asked. 

Flogging approaches and I-self 
discontinue. 

McKie put down a fit of trem- 
bling. 

“How far away, Fanny Mae?” 

Time reference by single-track 
difficult, McKie. Your term — 
soon. 

“Right away?” McKie asked 
and held his breath. 

Ask you of intensity immediate? 

“Probably,” McKie whispered. 

Probability, the Caleban said. 
Energy necessity of self- 1 extends 



alignment. Flogging not — immedi- 
ate. 

“Soon, but not right away,” 
Tuluk said. 

“She’s telling us she can take 
one more flogging and that’s the 
last one,” McKie said. “Let’s 
move. Fanny Mae, is there a jump- 
door available to us?” 

“Available, McKie. Go with 
love.” 

One more flogging, McKie 
thought as he helped Tuluk gather 
up the instruments. Buy why was a 
flogging so deadly to the Caleban? 
Why a flogging when other energy 
forms apparently didn’t touch 
them? 



XIV 

A T SOME indeterminate mo- 
ment — and that soon — the 
Caleban was going to be lashed by 
a whip and it would die. The half- 
mad possibility was about to be- 
come apocalyptic reality and the 
sentient universe would end. 

McKie stood disconsolately in 
Tuluk’s personal lab, intensely 
aware of the mob of enforcer 
guards around them. 

Go with love. 

The computer console above 
Tuluk’s position at the bench flick- 
ered and chittered. 

Even if Tuluk identified Fanny 
Mae’s star — what could be done 
with the new knowledge? 

“Is it possible,” Tuluk asked, 



WHIPPING STAR 



141 




“that the Calebans created this 
universe? Is this their garden 
patch? I keep remembering Fanny 
Mae saying it would uncreate us 
to be in her presence.” 

He leaned against his bench, 
mandibles withdrawn, face slit 
open just enough to permit him to 
speak. 

“Why’s the damn computer tak- 
ing so long?” McKie demanded. 

“The pulse problem’s very com- 
plicated, McKie. The comparison 
required special programing. You 
haven’t answered my question.” 

“I don’t have an answer. I hope 
those numbies we left in the Beach- 
ball know what to do.” 

“They’ll do what you told them 
to do,” Tuluk chided. “You’re a 
strange sentient, McKie. I’m told 
you’ve been married more than 
fifty times. Is it a breach of good 
manners to discuss this?” 

“I never found a woman who 
could put up with a Saboteur Ex- 
traordinary,” McKie muttered. 
“We’re hard creatures to love.” 
“Yet the Caleban loves you.” 
“She doesn’t know what we 
mean by love.” He shook his head. 
“I should’ve stayed at the Beach- 
ball.” 

“Our people will interpose their 
own bodies between the Caleban 
and any attack,” Tuluk said. 
“Would you call that love?” 

“That's self-preservation,” Mc- 
Kie snarled. 

“It’s a Wreave belief that all 
love is a form of self-preservation,” 



Tuluk said. “Perhaps this is what 
our Caleban understands.” 

“Hah!” 

“It’s a probability, McKie, that 
you’ve never been overly con- 
cerned about self-preservation, 
thus have never really loved.” 
“Look — would you stop trying 
to distract me with your babbling 
nonsense?” 

“Patience, McKie. Patience.” 
“Patience, he says.” McKie 
jerked himself into motion, paced 
the length of the lab, the guardian 
enforcers dodging out of his way. 
He returned to Tuluk, stopped. 
“What do stars feed on?” 

“Stars? Stars don’t feed.” 

“She inhales something here 
and she feeds here,” McKie mut- 
tered. He nodded. “Hydrogen.” 
“What’s this?” 

“Hydrogen,” McKie repeated. 
“If we opened a big enough jump- 
door— Where’s Bildoon?” 

“He’s conferring with the Con- 
Sent representatives over our high- 
handed actions in quarantining the 
Beautybarbers. It’s also a distinct 
possibility that our dealings with 
the Taprisiots have leaked out. 
Governments do not like this sort 
of action, McKie. Bildoon is try- 
ing to save your skin and his own.” 
“But there’s plenty of hydro- 
gen,” McKie said. 

“What is this of jumpdoors and 
hydrogen?” 

“Feed a cold and starve a fever,” 
McKie said. 

“You are not making sense,

IF 




McKie. Did you take your an- 
geret and normalizes?” 

“I took them.” 

The computer’s readout cham- 
ber made a chewing sound, spewed 
forth a quadruple line of glowing 
characters that danced in the 
chamber and resolved them- 
selves into legible arrangements. 
McKie read the message. 

“Thyone,” Tuluk said, reading 
over his shoulder. 

“A star in the Pleiades,” McKie 
said. 

“We call it Drnlle,” Tuluk said. 
“See the Wreave characters in the 
third row? Drnlle.” 

“Any doubt of this identifi- 
cation?” 

“You joke.” 

“Bildoon,” McKie hissed. “We 
have to try it.” 

He spun around, pounded out 
of the lab, dodged through Tu- 
luk’s assistants in the outer area. 
Tuluk darted in his wake, draw- 
ing their enforcer guardians into 
a thin line close behind. 

“McKie,” Tuluk called. “Where 
are you going?” 

“To Bildoon — then back to 
Fanny Mae.” 

N othing could stop him 
now, Cheo told himself. 

Mliss would die in a few min- 
utes, deprived of air in the Beauty- 
barber tank where he had confined 
her. The others on their refuge 
world would then have to follow 
him. He would control the S’eye 



and the threads of power. 

Cheo stood in his quarters, the 
S’eye controls near athand. It was 
night outside but all things re- 
mained relative, he reminded him- 
self. Dawn would be breaking 
soon where the Caleban’s Beach- 
ball rested above the surf on 
Cordiality. 

The Caleban’s ultimate dawn — 
the dawn of ultimate discontinuity. 
That dawn would slip into eternal 
night on all the planets that shared 
a universe with the doomed Cale- 
ban. 

In just a few minutes, this plan- 
et-of-the-past where he stood 
would reach its point of proper 
connectives with Cordiality. And 
the Palenki waiting across the 
room there would do what it had 
been commanded to do. 

Cheo rubbed the scars on his 
forehead. 

There would be no more Pan 
Spechi to point accusing fingers 
at him, to call him with ghostly 
voices. Never again would there be 
a threat to the ego he had secured 
to himself. 

No one could stop him. 

Mliss could never come back 
from death to stop him. She must 
be gasping in the sealed tank by 
now, straining for oxygen that did 
not exist. 

And McKie. The Saboteur Ex- 
traordinary had proved to be 
elusive and annoying but no way 
remained for him to stop the 
apocalypse. 



WHIPPING STAR 



143 




Just a few more minutes now. 

Cheo looked at the reference 
dials on the S’eye controls. They 
moved so slowly it was difficult to 
detect any change while you kept 
your eyes on them. But they 
moved. 

He crossed to the doors opening 
to the balcony, drew a questioning 
stare from the Palenki and stepped 
outside. There was ho moon but 
many stars shone in patterns alien 
to a Pan Spechi. Mliss had or- 
dered a strange world here with 
its bits of ancient history from her 
Terran past, its odds and ends of 
esoterica culled from the ages. 

Those stars, now. The Caleban 
had assured them no other planets 
existed here — yet there were stars. 
If those were stars. Perhaps they 
were only bits of glowing gas 
arranged in patterns Mliss had 
requested. 

This would be a lonely place af- 
ter the other universe was gone, 
Cheo realized. And there would 
be no escaping those starry pat- 
terns, reminders of Mliss. 

But he would be safe here from 
pursuit — because there would be 
no pursuers. 

He glanced back into the lighted 
room. 

How patiently the Palenki 
waited, eyes lidded, motionless. 
The whip dangled limply from its 
single hand. Crazy anachronism 
of a weapon — but it worked. With- 
out that wild conjunction of Mliss 
and her kinky desires they would 



never have discovered the thing 
about the weapon, never have 
found this world and the way to 
isolate it forever. 

Cheo savored the thought of for- 
ever. That was a very long time. 
Too long, perhaps. The thought 
disturbed him. Loneliness for- 
ever. 

He cut off these thoughts, 
looked once more at the S’eye 
dials. The pointers had moved a 
hair closer to the curtained mo- 
ment. They would coincide pres- 
ently. 

Not looking at the pointers, not 
looking anywhere, really, Cheo 
waited. Night on the balcony was 
full of the odors Mliss had gather- 
ed — exotic blooms, scents and 
musks of rare life forms, exhala- 
tions of myriad species she had 
brought to share her Ark. 

Ark. That was an odd name 
she’d given this place. Perhaps he 
would change that — later. Creche? 
No. The word carried painful re- 
minders. 

Why were there no other plan- 
ets? Surely the Caleban could have 
provided other planets. But Mliss 
had not ordered them created. 

Only the thinnest of lines sep- 
arated the pointers on the S’eye 
dials. 

Cheo went back into the room, 
called the Palenki. 

The squat turtle shape stirred 
itself to action, came to Cheo's 
side. The thing looked eager. Pa- 
lenkis enjoyed violence." 



144 



IF 




Cheo felt suddenly empty but 
there was no turning back. He 
put his hands to the controls — hu- 
manoid hands. They, too, would 
remind \\\m of Mliss. He turned a 
knob. It felt oddly alien to his 
touch but he stifled all uneasiness, 
all regrets, concentrated on the 
pointers. 

They flowed into each other and 
he opened the jumpdoor. 

“Now,” he commanded. 



M C.KIE heard the Pan Spechi’s 
shouted command as the 
jumpdoor’s vortal tube leaped in- 
to existence within the Beachball. 
The opening dominated the room, 
filled the purple gloom with bright 
light. The light came from behind 
two figures revealed by the open- 
ing — a Palenki and the Pan Spechi, 
Cheo. 

The vortal tube began swelling 
to dangerous dimensions within 
the confined room. Wild energies 
around its rim hurled enforcer 
guardians aside. Before they could 
recover, the Palenki arm thrust 
into the room, lashed out with its 
whip. 

McKie gasped at the shower of 
green and golden sparks around 
the Caleban. Golden! Again the 
whip struck. More sparks glit- 
tered, fell, shimmered into noth- 
ingness. 

“Hold!” McKie shouted as the 
enforcers recovered and moved to 
attack. He wanted no more cas- 



ualties from a closing jumpdoor. 
The enforcers hesitated. 

Once more the Palenki lashed 
out with its whip. 

Sparks glowed, fell. 

“Fanny Mae,” McKie called. 

I reply, the Caleban said. 

McKie felt the abrupt rise in 
temperature but the emotion ac- 
companying the words was calm, 
soothing — and powerful. 

The enforcers jittered, their at- 
tention darting from McKie to 
the area where the Palenki arm 
continued its vicious play with the 
whip. Each stroke sent a shower of 
golden sparks into the room. 

“Tell me of your substance, 
Fanny Mae,” McKie said. 

My substance grows, the Cale- 
ban said. You bring me energy and 
goodness. I return love for love 
and love for hate. You give me 
strength for this, McKie. 

“Tell me of discontinuity,” 
McKie said. 

Discontinuity withdraws! A 
definite elation was in the Cale- 
ban's words. I do not see node of 
connectives for discontinuity. My 
companions shall return in love. 

McKie inhaled a deep breath. 
It was working. But each new flow 
of Caleban words brought its 
blast from the furnace. That, too, 
spoke of success. He mopped his 
forehead. 

The whip continued to rise and 
fall. 

“Give up, Cheo," McKie called. 



WHIPPING STAR 



145 




“You’ve lost.” He peered up 
through the jumpdoor. “We’re 
feeding her faster than you can rob 
her of substance.” 

Cheo barked an order to the 
Palenki. Arm and whip withdrew. 

“Fanny Mae,” the Pan Spechi 
called. 

There was no answer but McKie 
sensed a wave of pity. 



Did she pity Cheo? 

“I command you to answer me, 
Caleban,” Cheo called “Your 
contract orders you to obey.” 

I obey holder of contract only, 
the Caleban said. You share no 
connectives with holder of con - 
tract. 

“She ordered you to obey me.” 
McKie held his breath, watch-

ing, waiting for his moment to act. When Fanny Mae summoned Ab- 
It must be done with precision, nethe a sacrifice must be made. 
The Caleban had been lucidly clear Abnethe had to die and her world 
about that— for once.. There could would die with her.

That was what Fanny Mae had Thyone. Name of love I receive 
said and the meaning seemed clear, from AlcKie— Thyone. 



WHIPPING STAR 



147 



“McKie, what have you done?” 
Cheo demanded. He poised his 
fingers over the S’eye controls. 
“Why doesn’t she respond to the 
whipping?” 

“She nerer really did respond to 
a whipping,” McKie said. “She 
responded to the violence and the 
hate that went with it. And that 
took a lot of energy. She’s almost 
pure emotion, you know. That’s 
how the universe goes, Cheo.” 
Where was Abnethe? 

Cheo motioned to the Palenki, 
hesitated as McKie said, “It’s no 
use, Cheo. We’re feeding her faster 
than you can drain her.” 

“Feeding her?” Cheo bent his 
scarred head forward to peer at 
McKie. 

“We’ve opened a giant jump- 
door in space,” McKie said. “It’s 
gathering free hydrogen and feed- 
ing it directly into Thyone.” 

“What is this — this Thyone?” 
Cheo demanded. 

“The star that is a Caleban,” 
McKie said. 

“What are you talking about?” 
“Haven’t you guessed?” 

He gave a subtle hand signal to 
the enforcers. Abnethe still had 
not shown up. Perhaps C+ieo 
had confined her somewhere. That 
changed things to the contingency 
plan. They were going to have to 
iry getting a sentient through the 
jumpdoor. 

The enforcers, responding to 
his signal, began moving closer to 
the opening. Each held a raygen. 



“Guessed what?” Cheo asked. 

/ have to keep him distracted , 
McKie thought. 

“Calebans manifest themselves 
in mir universe several ways,” he 
said. “They’re stars, suns — which 
may really be feeding orifices. 
They created these Beachballs — 
which are probably intended as 
much to protect us as they are to 
house the speaking manifestation. 
Even with the Beachball’s damp- 
ing force they can’t hold back all 
the radiant energy of their speech. 
That’s why it gets so hot in here.” 
McKie glanced at his ring of 
enforcers. They were moving clos- 
er and closer to the jumpdoor. 
“Stars?” Cheo asked. 

“This particular Caleban has 
been identified,” McKie said. 
“She’s Thyone in the Pleiades.” 
“But — the S’eye effect — ” 
“Star-eyes,” McKie said. “At 
least, that’s how I interpret it. 
I’m probably only partly right, but 
Thyone here admits she and her 
kind suspected the truth during 
their first attempts at communica- 
tion.” 

Cheo moved his head slowly 
from side to side. 

“Thejumpdoors — ” 
“Star-powered,” McKie said. 
“We’ve known from the first they 
required stellar energies to breach 
space that way. The Taprisiots 
gave us a clue when they spoke of 
imbedments and crossing Caleban 
connectives to — ” 

“You talk nonsense,” Cheo 



148 



IF 




growled. “Is it not nonsense?” 

“Undoubtedly,” McKie agreed. 
“But it’s a nonsense that moves 
reality in our universe.” 

“You think you’ll distract me 
while your companions prepare 
to attack,” Cheo said. “I will now 
show you another reality in your 
universe.” 

He twisted the jumpdoor con- 
trols. 

“Thyone,” McKie shouted. 

The jumpdoor’s opening began 
moving toward McKie. 

I reply to McKie, the Caleban 
said. Cheo discontinues connec- 
tives. 

The jumpdoor continued moving 
toward McKie but he saw that 
Cheo appeared to be having trou- 
ble with the controls. McKie 
moved aside as the opening passed 
through the space where he had 
been. 

“Stop him,” McKie called. 

Cheo stops himself, the Cale- 
ban said. 

McKie sensed a definite wave of 
compassion with the words. 

The jumpdoor opening turned 
on its axis, advanced once more on 
McKie. It moved a bit faster this 
time. 

McKie dodged aside, scattering 
enforcers. Why weren’t the 
damned fools trying to get through 
the opening? Afraid of being cut 
up? He steeled himself to dive 
through the opening on the next 
pass. Cheo had been conditioned to 
the thought of fear now. He 



wouldn’t expect attack from some- 
one who feared him. McKie swal- 
lowed in a dry throat. He knew 
what would happen to him. The 
molasses delay in the vortal tube 
would give Cheo just enough time. 
McKie would lose both legs — at 
the very least. He’d get through 
with a raygen, though, and Cheo 
would die. Given any luck, Ab- 
nethe could be found — and she 
would die, too. 

Again the jumpdoor plunged to- 
ward McKie. 

He leaped, collided with an en- 
forcer who had chosen the same 
instant to attack. They sprawled on 
hands and knees as the vortal 
tube slipped over them. 

McKie saw Cheo’s gloating face, 
the hand jerking at the controls. 
He saw a control arm snap over, 
heard a distant crackling as the 
jumpdoor ceased to exist. 

Someone screamed. 

McKie felt himself considerably 
surprised to be still on hands and 
knees in the purple gloom of the 
Beachball’s interior. He held his 
position, allowed his memory to 
replay that last glimpse of Cheo. 
It’d been a ghostly vision, smoky 
substance visible through the Pan 
Spechi’s body— and the visible sub- 
stance had been that of the Beach- 
ball’s interior. 

Discontinuity dissolves con- 
tract, the Caleban said. 

McKie climbed slowly to his 
feet. “What does that mean, Thy- 
one?” 



WHIPPING STAR 



149 




Statement of fact with meaning 
intensity-truth only for Cheo and . 
companions, the Caleban said. 
Self cannot give meaning to Me Kie 
for substance of another. 

McKie nodded. 

“That universe of Abnethe’s was 
her own creation,” he murmured. 
“A figment of her imagination.” 

Explain figment , the Caleban 
said. 

C HEO experienced the instant 
of Abnethe’s death as a grad- 
ual dissolution of substance 
around and within him. Walls, 
floor, S’eye controls, ceiling, 
world — everything faded into non- 
being. He felt all the haste of his 



existence swollen into one sterile 
instant. And he found himself for a 
transitory moment sharing with 
the shadows of the nearby Palenki 
and other more distant islands of 
movement a place of existence 
which the mystics of his own spe- 
cies had never contemplated. It 
was, however, a place which an 
ancient Hindu or a Buddhist might 
have recognized — a place of Maya, 
illusion, a formless void possessed 
of no qualities. 

The moment passed abruptly 
and Cheo ceased to exist. Or it 
could be said that he discontinued 
in becoming one with the void- 
illusion. One cannot, after all, 
breathe an illusion or a void. •

READING ROOM 

( Continued from page 2 ) 
tury. It’s a huge book, huge enough 
to justify the price of $12.50. And 
to anyone except the most incur- 
able completist, it should serve as 
an excellent sampling. 

There are 1122 daily strips in- 
cluded, as well as a full-color sec- 
tion with 64 of the Sunday episodes. 
This represents almost four years 
of daily reading and a year and a 
quarter of the Sunday features. In 
addition, there is a spate of supple- 
mental material. The editor, Rob- 
ert C. Dille, tells how his father 
suggested the idea of the comic 
strip to writer Phil Nowlan and 
brought Dick Calkins in as illus- 
trator. Ray Bradbury adds further 
history, along with a nostalgic ap- 
preciation. And to make everything 
clear, Nowlan and Calkins give a 
summary of everything they con- 
ceived for the 25th Century. At the 
end of the book, the first script for 
the radio serial is presented, togeth- 
er with promotional material. 

Quite properly, the early years 
receive the most attention in the 
book. Almost all the strips from 
the first year arc included, together 
with all major episodes through 
1931. Then there is a 1938 transi- 
tion piece, followed by samples of 
♦he work from 1942 on, after the 
death of Nowlan: these are both 
written and drawn by Calkins. The 
full-color section (awkwardly 
stuck in the middle of the first year 
of daily strips) shows the art of 



Rick Yager, first with Nowlan's 
writing and then with his own. 

And what does it all add up to? 

This is a difficult question. I sus- 
pect part of the answer depends on 
how much the reader remembers of 
the strip and of the period. In any 
event, response is sure to vary from 
fascination to shocked annoyance. 
It’s a mixed bag, and by no means 
what my memory of it made me ex- 
pect. 

Of course, it’s totally unfair to 
read a comic strip in book format. 
It was plotted and drawn to be read 
with each tiny section separated by 
a full day from the next. Cram- 
ming a year of strips in a few hours 
inevitably exaggerates any faults 
and ruins the pacing. Episodes that 
use the same trick situation — such 
as some band of cowboys, Indians 
or gangsters left over into the 25th 
Century— become boringly repeti- 
tive on quick reading, though I can- 
not remember noticing this when 
the strip and I were both young. 
And the off-again-on-agpin love 
story was really not so silly when 
spread over months of reading, 
I'm sure. 

It may also seem unfair to ap- 
proach the work with a mind at- 
tuned to a world forty years be- 
yond the publishing traditions of 
its creation. But on this, I feel 
time may actually aid critical in- 
sight, and the later reading may 
well be thegenuinely fair one. 

Some of the crudities in the strip 
can never be forgiven. They prob- 



152 



IF 




ably reflect an attitude common 
among readers in 1929 — so com- 
mon as to be taken for granted 
without question — but the attitude 
was still wrong. Here the book 
serves as a valuable historical re- 
minder of how we got into some of 
our current men, but hardly as a 
beacon to guide our steps out of 
the errors oj our past. 

This is an American WASP's 
vision of the future. The Mongols 
are the villains originally. They are 
simply evil and vile, while Ameri- 
cans are mostly brave and noble 
(aside from Killer Kane, who sold 
out to the Mongols). Buck, as a 
man from the pure 1929 American 
tradition, is naturally even more of 
a good guy than anyone else, but 
all native white Americans tend to 
pretty noble. And later, when we 
meet races from other worlds, we 
find that they also lack the nobility 
inherent in being American and 
White and Two-Fisted and Pure 
beyond any shred of self-doubt. In 
fact, most are so dratted pure that 
there is hardly a touch of individual 
character to them. 

One can only wonder how much 
influence such work might ha\c 
had on the jingoism that led us to 
intern our Japanese during World 
War II. And how many of our 
soldiers in Korea looked at the 
men they chose to call “Gooks" 
with attitudes colored by such anti- 
oriental feeling as one finds here? 
It may be that the attitude was al- 
ready thoroughly imbued, and the 



comic strips were only a symptom; 
but certainly reinforcing such 
ideas could not have helped any. 

In some ways the art shows this 
distortion even more than the story 
material. The Asiatics are pre- 
sented as stereotypes of the Yellow 
Menace. Every face must sneer, all 
canines must be too long, most 
faces must be adorned with long 
drooping mustaches (this was at a 
time when facial hair wasn't worn 
by upright and noble WASPs). 
Even in the later strips, the Mar- 
tians are recognizably evil. They 
are pock-marked, have faces 
pitted with acne, or show some 
other such unfailing sign of evil. 

The art, incidentally, does im- 
prove as time goes on. At the begin- 
ning, it was crude even for the per- 
iod. The pictures of Buck and 
Wilma, Black Barney and Doctor 
Huer that we have in our mind 
must be from the Sunday features 
draw n by Rick Yager, which grad- 
ually influence the daily strip; cer- 
tainly the earty black-and-w bites 
show' little resemblance to the 
characters I thought I remem- 
bered. 

All of this explains the shocked 
annoyance I mentioned. Yet there 
is also the undeniable fascination, 
though it is harder to understand. 
There is a flow of inventiveness in 
the earlier strips that makes up for 
much of the crudit). The devices 
shown for later science still seem 
fairly convincing (though the ideas 
of rocket speeds and orbits were 



READING ROOM 



153 




ridiculous even in 1931). 

And there’s a curious pleasure in 
watching the earliest crudeness 
smooth out gradually into a well- 
oiled machine with set characters 
and a reliable set of plot devices, 
familiar yet still fun. 

It’s a hard book to put down, 
and one well worth the price. Yet 
it has nothing to do with the history 
of science fiction. Once upon a 
time it took off from a common 
background of travel to the future 
and then travel through space. But 
from the earliest days, its character 
was not at all that which science 
fiction was developing. 

Buck Rogers was exactly what it 
was meant to be — a comic strip. It 
was only science fiction in the 
sense that Jungle Jim was adven- 
ture fiction or Mandrake was fan- 
tasy. Flash Gordon’s adventures 
were far closer to science fiction, 
and even Ally Oop often came 
much closer to our field. 

To see how far from real science 
fiction the strip was, we must go 
back to its origin as Philip Francis 
Nowlan conceived it. This, of 
course, occurred in a novelette pub- 
lished in Amazing Stories for 
1928 and entitled “The Airlords of 
Han’’— illustrated by Frank R. 
Paul. 

Fortunately, we can make the 
comparison. Nowlan's story and 
its sequel are again available in 
soft-cover edition —Armageddon 
2419 (Ace, 60c). If you are plan- 
ning to buy or borrow the Chelsea 



House book, by all means invest in 
the Ace volume as well. 

Here things are alike only at the 
very beginning. Donald Wollheim 
indicates in a brief introduction 
that the plot of the strip follows the 
plot of Nowlan’s original novel- 
ettes fairly closely during the first 
two years, but I Suspect it is his 
memory rather than his research 
speaking; my memory indicated 
the same until I had a chance to 
reread the comic strips. 

In the novelettes the name of the 
character is Anthony Rogers, but 
otherwise the initial situation is the 
same as the strip, including the 
meeting with Wilma Deering. In 
other respects, however, there is 
only the most vague and general 
similarity. The book is primitive 
science fiction, but it is unmistak- 
ably science fiction. 

Nowlan as a writer immediately 
began to .build a world. Here are 
none of the stereotype groups — the 
cowboys and Indians who have 
stayed the same, but more so, for 
five hundred years. Instead he sets 
up a complex social system of rule 
among small organizations de- 
signed to make survival possible in 
a world overrun by the Han — a 
seemingly Mongol people who 
have conquered the world and now 
exist in great cities, with the rural 
sections left to the survivors of the 
original population. He also sets 
up an extensive technology and 
social system for the Hans. 

Much of the handling is crude.

IF 




Characters are wooden and not 
always believable — as the Boss 
who voluntarily steps down with a 
cheer so Rogers can take over. 
There is a regrettable tendency for 
important action to occur while 
Tony Rogers is off-stage or for it 
to be merely summarized. And our 
old friend the Yellow Menace is 
apparent in the Han Empire. 

However, in this original Now- 
lan version, the Yellow Menace is 
not nearly so pat. The Han Em- 
peror, in fact, must be considered 
a highly civilized and cultured 
man. He keeps Tony prisoner but 
without needless cruelty. In fact, 
he is probably the best drawn and 
most likable character in the book. 
It is made clear that the Han are a 
special mutation that occurred in 
one tiny section of Mongolia, not 
typical of Asiatics; and it is even 
hinted that they may not be Earth 
humans at all. 

\t the end, Nowlan must have 
been aware of the trap he had 
worked himself into, since he tries 
to throw out the racial implica- 
tion v This fails to overcome the 
racial bias of the book. But it's at 
lea't a token gesture, marking the 
road that science fiction was just 
starting to travel and which led to 
the realization that to be alien or 
different was not inherently to be 
evil. Science fiction eventually 
moved further away than any oth- 
er bod) of literature from the con- 
cept that it is wrong to be different. 
Unfortunately, the change never 



occurred in the comic strip, under- 
lying the lack of tie between it and 
genuine science fiction. 

Pavanne, by Keith Roberts (Ace 
Special, 95c), also is a book made 
from novelettes previously pub- 
lished. But that is the only point of 
similarity between it and Nowlan’s 
book. 

This is perhaps the most com- 
pletely sophisticated book of 
science fiction I have read. In fact, 
I was not sure it was science fiction 
until I reached the last few pages. 
It was difficult at first to be sure it 
was not pure fantasy -then it 
seemed to be speculative fiction 
about a what-if world— and then it 
really did not matter. 

The basic idea is a world some- 
what like ours but in which the his- 
tory has gone differently . Eliza- 
beth I was assassinated in 1588, 
and the results changed all history, 
most particularly that of the 
Church of Rome. This is covered 
succinctly in a page of | lologue, 
but it takes the whole book to 
make those changes fully apparent. 

To round out the picture, we 
are led through a strange love af- 
fair to the circles of civil power, of 
castled lords and ladies, where a 
woman who seems to tie every- 
thing together must make her gal- 
lant battle against the darker 
forces slowly emerging i n to our 
view in this world. We learn with 
her to despair of things as they are 
here and to strive for an otherwise 
we cannot have.

And in the end, everything is 
stood on its head, turned upside 
down, and handed back to us with 
the key to the whole pictured 
world. It is as marvelously subtle 
an explanation as I’ve yet seen in 
any piece of writing. Every ele- 
ment is there, and yet it demands 
the utmost of the reader to rebuild 
the world he thought he had come 
to know into what and why it is. 

And, of course, in the end it is 
science fiction— because it has 
used every ethic and resource of 
science fiction and most of the 
background science-fictioneers 
have spent decades developing. 

Still, there remains one episode 
that simply cannot be made to fit. 
There is a story — the second “chap- 
ter” in the book — of one of the 
signalers. By itself, it is one of the 
best bits to be found in the whole 
structure. Yet there is no way of 
accounting for it except to call it 
pure fantasy. 

As fantasy, it’s fine. But the end 

RIDE ATINCAN 

“Got to going.” 

“Jinx on jolly, 

Golly, Holly!” 

“Were it other, 

Bug, my brother!” 

“Holly crying. 

Sing her flying, 

Jugging, shouting.” 

“Going outing.” 

Now this was remarkable. Hol- 
ly Harkel was crying when we 
came out of that burrow for the 



of the book with its implications 
about the girl involved with the 
signaler simply do not fit with the 
end of the story. 

I suspect that this episode was 
written as a magazine piece before 
the final shape of Roberts’ world 
had grown clear in his mind. 

As it stands, the book demands 
two mutually conflicting abilities 
on the part of the reader. He must 
be able to read this isolated epi- 
sode with a careless mind, letting 
the general picture soak in but 
most of the details vanish. For the 
rest of the book, and particularly 
for the final episodes, he must be 
willing to give his most painstak- 
ing attention to the writer, skip 
nothing and think things through 
precisely. 

If you want to try putting your- 
self through such a tricky course, 
this is a splendid book. If not, at 
least watch for more by Keith 
Roberts, who is writer of extra- 
ordinary promise. •

T ODAY I keep thinking how

It is a sticky business. I tried to 
complain but those people were 
still ringing that bell and chant- 
ing, “All you little Pig-Shelni- 
Singers come jump on the cart. 
Ride a tin can to Earth! Hey, 
Ben, look at them jump on the

“It was inexcusable,” I said. 
“Surely you could tell a human 
from a Shelni.” 

“Not that one,” said a bell- 
ringer. “I tell you they all jumped 



on the wagon willingly, even the 
funny-looking one who was cry- 
ing. Sure, you can have her bones, 
if you can tell which ones they 
are.”

by then he knew. He found Cap- 
pio’s blood-smeared utility knife 
in a crevice of Cappio’ s accelera- 
tion couch. Had Cappio possessed 
the iron resolve necessary to thrust 
it there in the few seconds before 
he bled to death? Or had it merely 
been a lucky break for him? Now 
there was no way of knowing. If 
it hadn’t been for the hatch, Gib- 
son thought, it would have 
worked. He’d have taken us with 
him. As it was, it hatf worked. 

Dead Cappio could not have the 
one good suit. Gibson would need 
it himself on Mars. He took Cap- 
pio out of it and put him into his 
own suit, sealing the leak as well 
as he could with tape from the aid 
kit. 

The odor persisted somehow, 
perhaps from the jammed dis- 
poser. Gibson used the auxiliary 
chemical toilet for his own wastes 
but it was too small to be of use

in disposing of the bodies. As 
Mars grew huge in the observa- 
tion port he cleaned every crevice 
of the couches and checked and 
rechecked the joints of the suits, 
using his nose as well as his eyes 
and trying not to look through the 
transparent face shields at Lorenz 
and Cappio. 

The landing was smooth, much 
smoother than Gibson had anti- 
cipated, and the rotation of the 
capsule had matched the Martian 
gravity so well that he found it 
difficult to detect any change. A 
pull of the emergency lever open- 
ed the hatch with a sharp detona- 
tion. Stiffly he climbed out and 
saw walking toward him the 
Moonbase psychologist. 

Dr. Mann spread his palms and 
said, “When I clap you will re- 
member that this flight is only a 
simulation.” 

Then he smelled Gibson. •

Readers write — and wrong! 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

I am sorry that Mr. M B. Tepper in 
his letter to Worlds of If was not seri- 
ous enough to understand my article 
about K. E. Tsiolkovsky ( K. E. T. ) and I 
am asking you kindly to publish the 
following elucidations. 

1. K.E.T. did not owe any of his 
philosophy to the Communist Revolu- 
tion in Russia. He was born on Sept. 
17, 1857, in a provincial family of an 
overly modest, patriarchal character 
and at the time of Revolution (1917) 
he was already 60 years old. 

2. Because of the idealistic character 
of his philosophy, many of his works 
were officially forbidden, ar\d after the 
publication of his Monism of the Uni- 
verse his secretary was fired by Soviet 
Government. K.E.T. was himself ar- 
rested once and put into a Moscow 
prison for a short time — he did not like 
to mention the episode in his conversa- 
tions and correspondence. 

3. It needs to be understood that, in 
Russia especially, there exist usually 
two kinds of emigrants: the outer 
(exo-) emigrants who left Russia for 
other countries, and the inner (endo-) 
emigrants who remain in their father- 
land and did not go abroad. As most 
of intellectuals, K.E.T. was a typical 
endo-emigrant. The endo-emigrants 
are usually the most silent people in 
relation to the internal governmental 
policy. Stalin was especially suspicious 
of taciturn people. Some “ silent peo- 



ple ," for safety's sake, occasionally 
praised governmental enactments in 
order to appear to the authorities as 
“non-Party Bolsheviks ." Tsiolkovsky 
never did this — also he never was a 
member of the Communist Party. He 
never praised communism and 
nothing of that ideology exists in his 
writings. 

4. Mr. Tepper says in his letter that 
K.E.T. had an inferiority complex. 
This is also wrong. K.E.T. was deaf, 
however, and said that his deafness 
helped him to concentrate. In his fam- 
ous, now classical work. Exploration 
of Space by Means of Reactive Ap- 
paratus, he says frankly that he was 
the first man who gave the complete 
theory of rockets and who proved the 
possibility of their use in the space 
flights. This is not the claim of a man 
suffering from an inferiority complex. 

5. To the end of his life K.E. T. won 
some popularity, not because of any 
special sympathy from the government 
but because the time itself was already 
ripe for the astronautic investigations. 
Most works by K.E.T. before 1930 
were printed in Kaluga, as author's 
editions, in a provintial typography 
where the typesettings for higher math- 
matics were absent. 

6. Certainly many points about the 
multitude of inhabited worlds in 
K.E.T.' s Monism of the Universe seem 
now obvious. However, he wrote them 
at a time when the works of de Fon- 
tenelle, C. Flammarion and those of 
other astronomers and philosophers 
were forgotten, at a time whenJ. Jeans 
even wrote that the presence of human- 
ity on the Earth is an unique fact in the 
whole Universe.
