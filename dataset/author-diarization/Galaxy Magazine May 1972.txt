WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 



Remember these personae dramatis; 

DR. FREDERICK HALLAM Known and revered 

around the globe as the 
Father of the Electron 
Pump. 

DR. PETER LAMONT Brilliant physicist and 

Hallam’s nemesis, who 

does not believe Hallam 
fathered the Pump— or 
' that the Pump is the 

unmixed blessing men 

believe. 



DR. BENJAMIN ALLAN DENISON . Bright radiochemist. 

whose disparaging re- 
marks, when both men 
were young, drove Hal- 
lam to eminence. 



The story opens approximately 
a hundred years in the future — on 
October 3. 2070 — when obscure 
and undistinguished Radiochemist 
FR EDER ICK HALLAM dis- 
covers that a bottle of tungsten-186, 
which someone had left on his desk, 
has mysteriously become converted 
to an impossible isotope, pluto- 
nium-186. Essentially afraid of 
being ridiculed by his more lust- 
rous and contemporary colleague, 
DR. BENJAMIN ALLAN 
DENISON, who habitually gibes 
at him, HALLAM enlists the aid 
of a distinguished physicist, 
KANTROVITSCH, and. leaning 
on the latter’s prestige, announces 
the new isotope to the world of 
science. 



A seminar is organized to study 
the revolutionary discovery. It is 
at first chaired by KANTRO- 
VITSCH, but subsequently by 
HALLAM, following HALLAM'S 
announcement of his Great Insight. 
The Great Insight starts out as a 
fantasy reputable scientists are 
afraid to touch. It postulates the 
existence of a Universe parallel to 
ours — a "para- Universe” — whose 
physical laws permit the existence 
of plutonium- 1 86 as a stable 
element, but will not tolerate tung- 
sten-186. A gateway, says HAL- 
LAM, has been opened between 
the two Universes, permitting our 
tungsten-186 to enter the para- 
Universe, where it becomes radio- 
actively converted to plutonium-186 



6 




and returned. In our Universe the 
latter element reverts to tungsten- 
186 with some loss of electrons, giv- 
ing out immense energy in the pro- 
cess. HALL AM proposes the 
construction of “Electron Pumps" 
to harness this energy for man's 
use. HALLAM'S hypothesis is 
greeted with reserve, but a scienti- 
fic team is organized to look into 
it. Evidence is found that the Great 
Insight is exactly that and H AL- 
LA M’S eminence in science is 
established — at least in the 
popular eye. 

Within two decades Electron 
Pumps girdle the globe, producing 
limitless, virtually no-cost energy 
with no attendant pollution. Wars 
and poverty vanish, disease is 
being conquered — toil, as men 
have known it, is on its way out. 
Earth is becoming a new Eden. 

These same two decades, how- 
ever, also produce PETER 
LAMONT, a brilliant young 
physicist who questions not only 
HALLAM’S eminence but the 
harmlessness of the Electron 
Pump itself. LAMONT believes 
that HALLAM’S scientific know- 
ledge is plagiarism, that he stole 
his Great Insight — and that the 
design and construction plans for 
the Electron Pump were handed 
to him by the inhabitants of the 
para- Universe, who wanted the 
Pump built. 

According to a popular paper 
published by HALL AM the 
plutonium-186 in our Universe 
emits twenty positrons per 
nucleus to combine with twenty 
of our electrons to the total energy- 
releasing annihilation of both, 
until it is converted to tungsten-186, 



which then operates in reverse to 
serve the para-Universe energy 
needs. The original raw material 
is never used up — the sole cost is 
the loss to our Universe of 
twenty electrons per atomic 
nucleus of the plutonium-186. At 
this rate, HALLAM and leading 
scientists maintain, possible nega- 
tive effects will not be felt while 
our Universe lasts. LAMONT’S 
calculations, however, lead him to 
the conviction that the effects of 
the constant electron drain are not 
evenly distributed throughout the 
Universe, but are concentrated 
immediately in our solar system, 
thus quickly threatening not only 
the solar system but the entire arm 
of the galaxy with annihilation. 

HALLAM’S prestige and op- 
position deny LAMONT a hearing 
in both scientific and governmental 
circles, prevent him from publish- 
ing his findings and wreck his 
career, as they have wrecked 
DENISON’S, who also had in- 
curred HALLAM’S wrath. In his 
efforts to prove that the Pump 
represents a real peril, LAMONT 
succeeds in establishing com- 
munications with the para-people 
— and learns that among them, too, 
concern exists regarding the opera- 
tion of the inter- Universe Electron 
Pump. He receives from them a 
desperate call for help in stopping 
it — though contact between humans 
and the para-Universe inhabitants 
had been thought impossible. From 
the tungsten-186/ plutonium- 1 86 
interaction many of their conditions 
of life become inferable. Fusion, 
for example, is likelier in their 
Universe than in ours and their 
suns would be smaller, perhaps 



THE GODS THEMSELVES

fewer than ours and rapidly cool- 
ing. (The section of this work 
dealing with the para-Universe ap- 
peared in the April issue of IfJ 
In the absence of other information 
the para-beings are visualized as 
direct consumers of energy — it is 
their food. We also know many of 
their approximate characteristics 
and that they understand and can 
manipulate matter at the subato- 
mic level. 

LAM O NT is unable to respond 
to the urgent appeal for help from 
the para-Universe — he has been 
effectively silenced by HALLAM. 
The voice of protest appears 
similarly to have been stilled in the 
para-Universe. The Pumps Pump 
on.

ELENE LINDSTROM smiled 
brightly and walked with the 
light springy touch that was star- 
tling when first seen by the tourists, 
but was soon recognized as having 
a grace of its own. 

“It’s time for lunch,” she said 
cheerfully. “And all home-grown, 
ladies and gentlemen. You may not 
be used to the taste, but it’s all 
nourishing — Right here, sir. You 
won’t mind sitting with the ladies, 

1 know. One moment — there will 
be seats for all. Sorry, there will be 
a choice on the beverage, but not 
on the main course — that will be 
veal — artificial flavor and texture, 
but it’s really quite good.” 

She herself finally sat down with 
a sigh and the briefest wavering of 
her pleasant expression. 

One of the group seated himselt 
across from her. 



“Do you mind?” he asked. 

She looked at him quickly, pene- 
tratingly. She had the faculty of 
making fast judgments — he did not 
seem troublesome. 

She said, “Not at all. But aren’t 
you with someone in this group?” 

He shook his head. “I’m alone. 
But even if that were not the case 
— Eafthies are no thrill to me.” 

She looked at him again. Fifty- 
ish. She saw a weariness about him, 
belied only by his bright, inquisitive 
eyes. He had the unmistakable look 
of the Earthman, laden with 
gravity. 

She said, “‘Earthie’ is a Moon 
expression — and not a nice one.” 

“I’m from Earth,” he said, “so 
I can use it without offense, 1 hope. 
Unless you object.” 

Selene shrugged as though to 
say. Please yourself . 

She had the faintly Oriental look 
about the eyes so many of the 
Moon girls had, but her hair was 
the color of honey and her nose was 
prominent. She was undeniably at- 
tractive without being in any way 
classically beautiful. 

The Earthman was staring at the 
name plate she wore on the blouse 
covering the upper slope of her 
high, not-too-large left breast. She 
decided it was really the name 
plate he was looking at, not the 
breast, though the blouse was semi- 
transparent when it caught the 
light at a particular angle and she 
wore no garment beneath it. 

He said, “Are there many 
Selenes here?” 




8 



GALAXY 




1 “Oh, yes. Hundreds, I think. 
^Also Cynthias, Dianas and Arte- 
mises. Selene is a little tiresome. 
Half the Selenes I know are called 
‘Silly’ and the other half ‘Lena.”’ 
“Which are you?” 

“Neither. I am Selene, all three 
syllables. SELL-uh-nee,” she said, 
coming down heavily on the first 
syllable, “to those who use my first 
name at all.” 

The small smile sat on the Earth- 
man’s face as though he weren’t 
quite used to it. “And what if any- 
one asks you if you sell any, 
Selene?” 

“They never ask me again,” she 
said firmly. 

“But do they ask you?” 

“There are fools always.” 

A waitress had reached their 
table and had placed the dishes be- 
fore them with quick, smooth 
motions. 

The Earthman was visibly im- 
pressed. He said to the waitress, 
“You make them seem to float 
down.” 

The waitress smiled and moved 
on. 

Selene said, “Don’t you try to 
do the same. She’s used to the 
gravity and can handle it.” 

“And if I try. I’ll drop every- 
thing? Is that it?” 

“You’ll make a gorgeous mess,” 
she said. 

“Well, I won’t try.” 

“There’s a good chance someone 
will before long — the plate will 
float to the floor and all at the table 
will grab for it and miss and ten to 
one knock themselves out of their 
chairs. I’d warn them, but it never 
helps and they’re just all the more 
embarrassed. The other tourists 



will laugh. The rest of us have seen 
it too often to find it funny--to us 
it just means a clean-up job.” 

T he Earthman was lifting his 
fork carefully. “I see what you 
mean. Even the simplest motions 
seem strange.” 

“Actually, you’ll get used to the 
gravity quickly enough. At least in 
little things like eating. Walking is 
harder. I never saw an Earthman 
run efficiently out there. Not quite 
efficiently.” 

For a while they ate in silence. 
Then he asked, “What does the 
L stand for?” He was looking at 
her name plate again. It said, 
SELENE LINDSTROM L. 

“It just means Luna,” she said 
rather indifferently, “to distinguish 
me from the immigrants. I was 
born here.” 

“Really?” 

“That’s nothing to be surprised 
about. We’ve had a working society 
here for more than half a century. 
Don’t you think babies are born 
here? We have people here who 
were born here and are grand- 
parents.” 

“How old are you?” 
“Thirty-two,” she said. 

He looked startled, them mum- 
bled, “Of course.” 

Selene raised her eyebrows. 
“You mean you understand? 
Most Earthmen have to have it 
explained.” 

The Earthman said, “I under- 
stand enough to know that most of 
the visible signs of aging are the 
result of the inexorable victory of 
gravity over tissue — the sagging 
of cheek and the drooping of 
breast. The Moon’s gravity is 



THE GODS THEMSELVES

one-sixth that of Earth — it isn’t 
really hard to figure why people 
here stay young-looking.” 

Selene said, “Only young look- 
ing. We don’t have immortality. 
The lifespan is about that on 
Earth — but most of us are more 
comfortable in old age.” 

“That’s not to be dismissed. Of 
course, you suffer penalties.” He 
had just taken his first sip of Moon 
coffee. “You have to drink this — ” 
He paused for a word and must 
have discarded it, for he used none. 

“We could import food and 
beverages from Earth,” she said, 
amused, “but only enough to feed 
a fraction of us a fraction of the 
time. What would be the point? 
We can use the cargo space for 
more vital items. Besides, we’re 
used to this crud — or were you go- 
ing to use a stronger word?” 

“Not for the coffee,” he said. “1 
was going to save that for the 
food. But crud will do. Tell me. 
Miss Lindstrom. I didn’t see any 
mention of the tour itinerary of the 
proton synchrotron.” 

“The proton synchrotron?” 
She was finishing her coffee and 
her eyes were beginning to slide 
round the room as though esti- 
mating the moment for getting her 
charges to their feet again. “That’s 
Terrestrial property and it’s not 
open to tourists.” 

“Off-limits to Lunarites, too?” 
“Oh, no. Nothing of the sort. 
Most of its staff are Lunarites. But 
the Terrestrial government sets the 
rules. No tourists.” 

“I’d love to see it,” he said. 

She said, “I’m sure you would. 
You’ve brought me luck — not one 
item of food, not one blessed man 



or woman, has hit the floor.” 

She rose and said, “Ladies and 
gentlemen, we’ll be leaving in about 
ten minutes. Please leave the plates 
where they are. There are rest 
rooms for those who wish to use 
them. Then we will visit the food- 
processing plants where meals such 
as you have just eaten are made 
possible.”

S ELENE’S quarters were small, 
of course, and compact, but 
they were intricate. The windows 
were panoramic, showing star 
scenes that changed slowly and 
randomly, without relationship to 
any known constellation. Each of 
the three windows could be made to 
undergo telescopic magnification 
when Selene so desired. 

Barron Neville hated these 
stellar extravaganzas. He tended 
to turn them off rather savagely 
and say, “How can you stand them? 
You’re the only one I know who 
has the bad taste to go for these 
things. It’s not as though those 
nebulae and star clusters even 
exist.” 

And Selene would shrug coolly 
and say, “What’s existence? How 
do you know the ones out there 
exist? These displays give me a 
sensation of freedom and motion. 
May 1 have that in my own quarters 
if I choose?” 

Neville would mumble something 
and make a half-hearted attempt 
to restore the controls to where he 
had found them and Selene would 
say, “Let it go — ” 

The furniture was in smooth 
curves and the walls were abstract- 



10 



GALAXY 




ly decorated in unobtrusive low- 
key colors. Nowhere was there rep- 
resentation of anything that might 
be considered a living thing. 

“Living things are Earth,” 
Selene would say, “not the Moon.” 
As she entered she found — as so 
often —Neville present. Barron 
Neville rested on the flimsy couch, 
one foot sandaled. The other 
sandal lay on the floor where it had 
dropped. She saw a line of red 
marks on his abdomen, just over 
his umbilicus, where he had been 
meditatively scratching. 

She said, “Get us some coffee, 
won’t you, Barron?” and slipped 
out of her clothes in a long, grace- 
ful wiggle accompanied by a sigh. 
She let the skirt drop, then kicked 
it into the corner with one toe. 

“What a relief to get out of 
them,” she said. “The worst part 
of the job is having to dress like an 
Earthie.” 

Neville was in the kitchen corner. 
He paid no attention— he had heard 
her before. He asked, “What’s 
wrong with your water supply? 
It’s pretty far down.” 

“Is it?” she asked. “Well, I’ve 
been over-using, I suppose. Just be 
patient.” 

“Any trouble today?” 

Selene shrugged. “No. Just the 
usual bit, watching them teetering 
along and pretending they don’t 
hate the food — and wondering if 
they’ll be asked to take off their 
clothes, 1 shouldn’t wonder. Dis- 
gusting possibility.” 

“Are you taking up prudery?” 
He brought two small cups of 
coffee to the table. 

“In this case prudery is required. 
They’re wrinkled, sagging, paunchy 



and full of germs. I don’t care 
what the quarantine regulations 
are like — Earthies are full of 
germs. What’s new on your side?” 
Barron shook his . head. He was 
heavily built for a Lunarite and the 
sullen narrowing of his eyes had be- 
come a built-in feature. His other 
features were remarkably hand- 
some, Selene thought. 

He said, “Nothing startling. 
We’re still waiting out the change 
in Commissioners. We’ll have to 
see what this Gottstein is like.” 
“Can he make difficulties?” 

“No more than are being made. 
After all, what can they do? They 
can’t infiltrate. You can’t disguise 
an Earthie as a Lunarite.” He ap- 
peared uneasy, just the same. 

S ELENE sipped her coffee and 
looked at him shrewdly. “Some 
Lunarites might be Earthies inside.” 
“Yes, and I’d like to know which. 
Sometimes I don’t think I can trust 
— Oh, well. I’m wasting incredible 
amounts of time with my synchro- 
tron project and getting nowhere. 
I’m having no luck with priorities.” 
“They probably don’t trust you 
— and I don’t blame them. If you 
didn’t slink around so conspira- 
torially 

“1 do no such thing. It would 
give me great pleasure to walk out 
of the synchrotron room and never 
return, but then they wouW become 
suspicious. If you’ve been raising 
hell with your water supply, Selene, 
I suppose we can’t have a second 
cup.” 

“No, we can’t. But if it comes to 
that, you’ve been helping me waste 
water. You’ve had two showers 
here in the last week.” 



THE GODS THEMSELVES

“I’ll give you a water credit. I 
didn’t know you were counting.’’ 
“I’m not counting. My water 
level is.” She finished her own cup 
of coffee and stared at its empti- 
ness thoughtfully. She said, “They 
always make faces over our coffee 
— the tourists do. And I can never 
figure out why. It tastes fine to me. 
Did you ever taste Earth coffee, 
Barron?” 

“No.” 

“1 did. Once. Some tourist had 
smuggled in packets of what he 
called instant coffee. He offered 
me some in exchange for you-know 
-what. Seemed to think it was an 
even trade.” 

“And you had some?” 

“I was curious. It was bitter 
and metallic. I hated it. Then I 
told him that miscegenation was 
against Lunarite custom and he 
turned rather bitter and metallic 
himself.” 

“You never told me this. He 
didn’t try anything, did he?” 

“It’s not particularly your busi- 
ness, is it? And, no, he didn’t try 
anything. If he had tried — at the 
wrong gravity for him — I’d have 
bounced him from here to Cor- 
ridor One.” She paused, then went 
on; “Oh, yes. I picked up another 
Earthie today. Insisted on sitting 
with me.” 

“And what did he offer you in 
exchange for the screwing you so 
delicately call you-know-what?” 
“Just sat there.” 

“And stared at your breasts?” 
“They’re there to be stared at, 
but actually he didn’t. He stared at 
my name plate. Besides, what’s it 
to you what he fantasied? Fantasies 
are free and I don’t have to fulfill 



them. What do you think I’m 
fantasying? Bed with an Earthman? 
With all the action you would ex- 
pect of someone trying to handle a 
gravitational field he isn’t used to? 
1 wouldn’t say it hasn’t been done, 
but not by me — and I’ve never 
heard any good of it. Is that settled? 
Can I get back to the Earthie? 
Who’s over fifty? And who obvi- 
ously wasn’t terrifically handsome 
even when he was twenty? Interest- 
ing appearance, though— I’ll grant 
him that.” 

“All right. I can do without a 
thumbnail sketch. What about 
him?” 

“He asked about the proton 
synchrotron.” 

Neville rose to his feet, swaying 
a little as was almost inevitable 
after quick movement at low grav- 
ity. “What did he ask about the 
synchrotron?” 

“Nothing. Why are you so ex- 
cited? You requested that I tell you 
anything that was out of the way 
with any tourist at any time and 
this seemed out of the way. No one 
ever asked me about the synchro- 
tron before.” 

“All right.” He paused a little, 
then in a normal voice, said, “Why 
was he interested in the synchro- 
tron?” 

“I haven’t the faintest idea. He 
just asked if he could see it. It 
could be that he’s a tourist fasci- 
nated by science. For all 1 know 
his question was just a ploy to get 
me interested in him.” 

“And I suppose you are. What’s 
his name?” 

“I don’t know. I didn’t inquire.” 

“Why not?” 

“Because I’m not interested in 



12 



GALAXY 




him. Which way do you want it 
to be? Besides, his asking shows 
he’s a tourist. If he were a physi- 
cist he wouldn’t have to ask. He’d 
be there.” 

“My dear Selene,” said Neville, 
“let me spell it out. Under the 
present circumstances anyone who 
asks to see the proton synchrotron 
is a peculiar fellow we want to 
know about. And why should he 
ask you, specifically you?” He 
moved restlessly in the small con- 
fines as though trying to work off 
energy. Then: “You’re the expert 
at that nonsense. Do you find him 
of interest?” 

“Sexually?” 

“You know what I mean. Don’t 
play games, Selene.” 

Selene said with clear reluctance, 
“He’s interesting, even disturbing. 
But I don’t know why. He said 
nothing. He did nothing.” 
“Interesting and disturbing, is 
he? Then you will see him again.” 
“And do what?”

MARCH and April (which is when you 
ought to be reading this) are particu- 
iarly rich, leading off with JBC's 
Domnei — his usual exquisite bawdy 
romp — and Lin Carter's own Dis-

well-known "mainstream" writers 
who were (virtually in secret) pro- 
ducing provocative fantasy. Also, 
an absolutely delicious, delightfully 
sophisticated fantasist, Ernest Bramah. 
His first for us (and what a cover!) 
Kai Ling's Golden Hours. Bramah is 
some kind of past master at the art of 
the written double-take. And God love 
his ever-living English.

Laumer has contributed five of his 
fine stories for a collection titled Time- 
tracks. And we have an honest-to- 
God first novel by Alan Dean Foster — 
solid, inventive, packed with ideas — 
The Tar-Aiym Krang. Then the Pope 
is at it again with The Reality Trip And 
Other Implausibilities — a collection 
we like even better than most. 
Douglas R. Mason is back with a 
weirdo — The Resurrection of Roger 
Diment. 



WE HAVE the Anthony Burgess opus 
MF. And, of course, his remarkable 
A Clockwork Orange which, if you 
have not read it yet, you certainly 
should. By all means see the movie, 
too — it's not as violent or as harsh as 
the book, but it is, pictorially, just as 
strong a statement against violence. 



REMEMBER Stand on Zanzibar? We

nounce that Harper has contracted for 
hardcover publication of The Sheep 
Look Up. They are scheduling it for 
early fall. And we're hoping for a book-

changing the overwhelming fact 
about the Moon — that its low grav- 
ity made life possible only under- 
ground even for the greatest 
Earthman who ever lived. 

“Man is still the creature of his 
environment.” Luiz Montez then 
sighed. “I’ve been two years on the 
Moon and have known times when 
I have been tempted to stay on, 
but — I’m getting along in years. 
I’ve just passed my fortieth, and if 
I intend ever to go back to Earth it 
had better be now. Any older and I 
won’t be able to readjust to full 
gravity.” 

Konrad Gottstein was thirty-four 
and looked younger. He had a wide, 
round and large-featured face, the 
kind one did not see among the 
Lunarites — the kind they would 
draw as an Earthie caricature. He 
was not heavily built — it did not 
pay to send heavily built Earthmen 
to the Moon — and his head seemed 
too large for his body. 

He said — he spoke Planetary 
Standard with a perceptibly dif- 
ferent accent from that of Montez 
—“You sound apologetic.” 

“1 am, 1 am,” said Montez. 
Where Gottstein’s face was intrin- 
sically good-natured in appearance, 
the long thin lines of Montez’ 
rendered it almost comically 
tragic. “I am apologetic in both 
senses. I am embarrassed to be 
leaving the Moon, since it is an 
attractive world filled with excite- 
ment. And 1 am embarrassed 
about the embarrassment — 
ashamed that I should be reluctant 
to take up Earth’s burden, gravity 
and all.” 

“Yes, I imagine taking back the 
other five-sixths will be hard,” said 



14 



GALAXY 




Gottstein. “I’ve been on the Moon 
only a few days and already I feel 
that one-sixth G is perfectly fine.” 
“You won’t feel so when the 
constipation starts and you begin 
living on mineral oil,” said Montez 
with a sigh. “But that will pass. 
And don’t think you can imitate 
a gazelle just because you feel light. 
There’s an art to it.” 

“So I understand.” 

“You think you understand, 
Gottstein. You haven’t seen the 
kangaroo-walk, have you?” 

“On television.” 

“That doesn’t give you the feel 
of it. You have to try it. It’s the 
proper mode for crossing level 
lunar surface at high speed. The 
feet move backward together and 
launch you on what would be a 
simple broad-jump on Earth. While 
you’re in midair, they come for- 
ward and begin moving back just 
before they hit the ground again — 
keep you launched and so on. The 
motion seems slow by Earth stand- 
ards with only a low gravity whip- 
ping you on, but each leap is in ex- 
cess of twenty feet and the amount 
of muscular effort required to keep 
you aloft is minimal. The sensation 
is similar to that of flying.” 

“Have you tried it? Can you do 
it?” 

“I’ve tried it, but no Earthman 
can really do it. I’ve kept it up for 
as many as five leaps in a row, 
enough to get the sensation— just 
enough to want to do more — but 
then there is the inevitable miscal- 
culation, a loss of synchronization 
and you tumble and slide for a 
quarter of a mile. The Lunarites 
are polite and never laugh at you. 
Of course, it’s easy for them. They 



start as children and pick it up at 
once without trouble.” 

“It’s their world,” said Gottstein, 
chuckling. “Think how they’d be 
on Earth.” 

“They wouldn’t be on Earth. 
They can’t. 1 supposed that’s an 
advantage on our side. We can be 
either on Moon or on Earth. They 
can live only on the Moon. We tend 
to forget that — because we confuse 
the Lunarites with Immies.” 

“With what?” 

“That’s what they call the Earth 
immigrants — those who live on the 
Moon more or less permanently 
but were born and raised on Earth. 
The immigrants can, of course, re- 
turn to Earth, but the real 
Lunarites have neither the bones 
nor the muscles to withstand 
Earth’s gravity. There were some 
tragedies in that respect in the 
Moon’s early history.” 

“Oh?” 

“Oh, yes. People who returned 
with their Moon-born children. 
We tend to forget. We’ve had our 
own Crisis, and a few dying children 
don’t seem important in the light 
of the huge casualties of the late 
twentieth century and all that fol- 
lowed. Here on the Moon, though, 
every dead Lunarite who suc- 
cumbed to the gravity of Earth is 
remembered. It helps the people 
here to feel a world apart, I think.” 

G ottstein said, “i thought 
I had been thoroughly briefed 
on Earth, but it seems I still have a 
lot to learn.” 

“Impossible to learn everything 
on Earth, but I have left you as 
full a report as my predecessor be- 
queathed me. You’ll find the Moon

fascinating and, in some ways, ex- 
cruciating. I doubt that you’ve 
eaten Lunar rations on Earth — and 
if you’re going by description only, 
you will not be prepared for the 
reality. However, you’ll have to 
teach yourself to like the food. It’s 
bad policy to ship Earth items here. 
We’ve got to eat and drink the 
local products.” 

“You’ve been doing it. I guess 
I’ll survive.” 

“I’ve not been doing it steadily. 
There are periodic furloughs to 
Earth. Those are obligatory, 
whether you want them or not. 
They’ve told you that. I’m sure.” 

“Yes,” said Gottstein. 

“Despite any exercises you do 
here, you will have to subject your- 
self to full gravity now and then 
just to remind your bones and 
muscles what it’s like. And when 
you’re on Earth, you’ll eat. And 
occasionally some food is smuggled 
in.” 

Gottstein said, “My luggage was 
carefully inspected, of course, but 
it turned out there was a can of 
corned beef in my coat pocket. I 
had overlooked it. So did they.” 

Montez smiled slowly and said 
hesitantly. “1 suspect you are now 
going to offer to share it.” 

“No,” said Gottstein judiciously, 
wrinkling his large button nose. 
“I was going to say with all the 
tragic nobility I could muster, 
‘Here, Montez, have it all! Thy 
need is greater than mine.’” He 
stumbled a bit in trying to say this 
— he had rarely used second person 
singular in Planetary Standard. 

Montez smiled more broadly, 
then let the expression vanish. He 
shook his head. “No. In a week I’ll 



have all the Earth food I can eat. 
You won’t. Your mouthfuls will be 
rare in the next few years and you 
will spend too much time regretting 
your present generosity. You keep 
it all — I insist. Or I would only be 
earning your hatred ex post facto.” 
He seemed serious, his eyes looking 
straight into Gottstein’s. “Besides, 
there is something I want to talk 
to you about. I’ve been putting off 
discussion because 1 don’t know 
how to approach it, and this food 
would be an excuse for further side- 
tracking.” 

Gottstein pocketed the Earth can 
at once. His face could not match 
Montez’ in seriousness, but his 
voice was grave and steady. “Is 
there something you could not 
include your dispatches, Montez?” 

“There was something I tried to 
include, Gottstein, but between my 
not knowing how to phrase it and 
Earth’s reluctance to grasp my 
meaning — we ended up not com- 
municating. You may do better. I 
hope you do. One of the reasons I 
have not asked to have my tour 
of duty extended is that I can no 
longer take the responsibility for 
my failure to communicate.” 

“You make it sound serious.” 

“I wish I could make it sound 
serious. Frankly, it sounds silly. 
There are only some ten thousand 
people in the Lunar colony. Rather 
less than half are native Lunarites. 
They’re hampered by an insuf- 
ficiency of resources, an insuf- 
ficiency of space, a harsh world — 
and yet — and yet — ” 

“And yet?” said Gottstein. 

“Something is going on here — I 
don’t know exactly what — that may 
be dangerous.” 



16 



GALAXY 




“How can it be dangerous? What 
can they do? Make war against the 
Earth?” Gottstein’s lips trembled 
on the edge of a smile. 

“No. It’s more subtle than that.” 
Montez passed his hand over his 
face, rubbed his eyes. “Let me be 
frank with you. Earth has lost its 
nerve.” 

“What does that mean?” 

“Well, what would you call it? 
Just about the time the Lunar 
colony was being established. 
Earth went through the Great 
Crisis. I don’t have to tell you about 
that.” 

“No, you don’t,” said Gottstein, 
with distaste. 

“The population is two billion 
now, down from its six billion 
peak.” 

“Earth is much better for that, 
isn’t it?” 

“Oh, undoubtedly, though I wish 
there had been a better way of 
achieving the drop. But what hap- 
pened left behind a permanent 
distrust of technology, a vast iner- 
tia, a lack of desire to risk 
change because of the possible 
side-effects. Great and possibly 
dangerous efforts have been 
abandoned because the danger was 
feared more than greatness was 
desired.” 

“I take it you refer to the pro- 
gram on genetic engineering.” 

“That’s the most spectacular 
case, of course, but not the only 
one,” said Montez bitterly. 

“Frankly, I can’t get excited 
over the abandonment of genetic 
engineering. It was a tissue of 
failures.” 

“We lost our chance at Intui- 
tionism.” 



“There has never been any evi- 
dence that Intuitionism is desirable 
— and we have considerable indica- 
tion of its undesirability. Besides 
what about the Lunar colony itself? 
This certainly is no indication of 
stagnation on Earth.” 

Montez said vigorously, “The 
Lunar colony is a hangover, a last 
remnant of the period before the 
Crisis — something that carried 
through as a last sad forward 
thrust of mankind before the big 
retreat.” 

“That’s too dramatic, Montez.” 
“I don’t think so. Earth has re- 
treated, mankind has retreated — 
everywhere but on the Moon. The 
Lunar colony is man’s frontier not 
just physically, but psychologically, 
too. Here is a world that doesn’t 
have a web of life to disrupt, that 
doesn’t have a complex environ- 
ment in delicate balance to upset. 
Everything on the Moon that is of 
any use to man is man-made. The 
Moon is a world constructed by 
man from the start and out of 
basics. There is no past.” 

“Well?” 

“On Earth we are unmanned by 
our longing for a pastoral past that 
never really existed — and that, if 
it had existed, could never exist 
again. In some respects, much of 
the ecology was destroyed in the 
Crisis and we are making do with 
the remnants — so that we are 
frightened, always frightened. On 
the Moon there is no past to long 
for or dream about. There is no 
direction but forward.” 

M ontez seemed intoxicated 
by his own words. 
“Gottstein,” he continued fever- 



THE GODS THEMSELVES

ishly, “I have watched it for two 
years — you will watch it for at least 
that much longer. There is a fire 
here on the Moon, a restless burn- 
ing. The people here expand in 
every direction. They expand 
physically. Every month new cor- 
ridors are bored, a new living quar- 
ters established, a new population 
potential is made room for. They 
expand resources by developing 
new construction materials, new 
water sources, new lodes of special- 
ized minerals. They expand their 
sun-powered battery banks, enlarge 
their electronics factories. 1 sup- 
pose you know that these ten 
thousand people here on the Moon 
are now the major source for 
Earth’s supply of mini-electronic 
devices and fine biochemicals.” 

“I know they’re an important 
source.” 

“Earth lies to itself for comfort’s 
sake. The Moon is the major 
source. At the present rate it may 
soon become the sole source. Its 
people expand intellectually, too. 
Gottstein, I imagine there isn’t 
a bright science-oriented youngster 
on Earth who doesn’t vaguely — or 
perhaps not so vaguely — dream 
of going to the Moon one day. 
With Earth in retreat from tech- 
nology, the Moon is where the 
action is.” 

“You’re referring to the proton 
synchrotron, 1 suppose?” 

“That’s one example. When was 
the last new synchrotron built on 
Earth? But it’s just the biggest and 
most dramatic item — not the only 
or even the most important. If you 
want to know what is the most im- 
portant scientific device on the 
Moon — ” 



“Something so secret I haven’t 
been told?” 

“No, something so obvious that 
no one seems to notice. It’s the ten 
thousand brains here. The ten thou- 
sand best human brains in exis- 
tence. The only close-knit group of 
ten thousand human brains that 
are, in principle and by emotion, 
science-oriented.” 

Gottstein moved restlessly and 
tried to shift his chair’s position. 
It was bolted to the floor and 
wouldn’t move, but in the attempt 
to make it do so Gottstein found 
himself skittering from the seat. 
Montez reached out an arm to 
steady him. 

Gottstein flushed. “Sorry.” 
“You’ll get used to the gravity.” 
Gottstein said, “But aren’t you 
making it out a lot worse than it 
is? Earth isn’t a know-nothing 
planet altogether. We did develop 
the Electron Pump. That’s a purely 
Terrestrial accomplishment. No 
Lunarite had anything to do with 
it.” 

Montez shook his head and mut- 
tered a few words in his native 
Spanish. They did not sound placid. 
He asked, “Have you ever met 
Frederick Hallam?”, 

Gottstein smiled. “Indeed I have. 
The Father of the Electron Pump. 
I believe he has the phrase tattooed 
on his chest.” 

“The mere fact that you smile 
and make that remark proves my 
point, really. Ask yourself: Could 
a man like Hallam really have 
fathered the Electron Pump? The 
story will do for the unthinking 
multitude, but the truth is — and 
you must know this — there is no 
father to the Electron Pump. The 



18 



GALAXY 




para-people, the people in the para- 
Universe— whoever they are and 
whatever that is invented it. 
Hallam was their accidental in- 
strument. All of Earth is their 
accidental instrument. 

“We were clever enough to take 
advantage of their initiative.” 
“Yes, as cows are clever enough 
to eat the hay we provide for them. 
The Pump is no sign that man is 
looking forward. Quite the 
reverse.” 

“If the Pump is a backward step, 
then I say good for backwardness. 
1 wouldn’t want to do without it.” 
“Who would? But the point is, 
it fits Earth’s present mood per- 
fectly. Infinite energy at virtually 
zero cost— except for maintenance 
—and zero pollution. But there are 
no Electron Pumps on the Moon.” 
Gottstein said, “I imagine there’s 
no need for them. The solar bat- 
teries supply what the Lunarites 
require. ‘Infinite energy at virtually 
zero cost — except for maintenance 
— and zero pollution.’ Isn’t that the 
litany?” 

“Yes, indeed. But the solar bat- 
teries are entirely man-made. An 
Electron Pump was projected for 
the Moon — installation was at- 
tempted — ” 

“And?” 

“And it didn’t work. The para- 
people didn’t accept the tungsten. 
Nothing happened.” 

“I didn’t know that. Why not?” 

M ONTEZ lifted his shoulders 
and eyebrows expressively. 
“How is one to know? We might 
assume, for instance, that the para- 
people live on a world without a 
satellite — that they have no concep- 



tion of separate worlds in close 
proximity, each populated. That 
having found one contact they did 
not seek another. Who knows? The 
thing is that the para-people didn't 
bite and we ourselves, without 
them, could do nothing.” 

“We ourselves,” Gottstein re- 
peated. “By that you mean the 
Earthmen?” 

“Yes.” 

“And the Lunarites?” 

“They were not involved.” 

“Were they interested?” 

“I don’t know. That’s where 
my uncertainty — and fear — chiefly 
rest. The Lunarites— the native 
Lunarites particularly — do not 
feel like Earthmen. 1 don’t know 
what their plans are or what they 
intend. I can’t find out.” 

Gottstein looked thoughtful. 
“But what can they do? Do you 
have any reason to suppose they 
intend to do us harm — or that they 
can do Earth harm even if they in- 
tend it?” 

“I can’t answer that question. 
They are an attractive and intel- 
ligent people. It seems to me they 
lack real hatred or real rage or even 
real fear. But perhaps that is only 
how they seem to me. What bothers 
me most is that 1 don’t know.” 
“The scientific equipment on the 
Moon is run by Earth, I believe.” 
“That is correct. The proton 
synchrotron is. The radio tele- 
scope on the trans-terrestrial side 
is. The three hundred-inch optical 
telescope is. The large equipment,' 
you notice, all of which has been in 
existence for fifty years — ” 

“And what’s been put in since?” 
“Very little by Earthmen.” 
“What about the Lunarites?” 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



19 




“I’m not sure. Their scientists 
work in the large installations, but 
1 once tried to check time cards. 
There are gaps.” 

“Gaps?” 

“They spend considerable time 
away from the installations. It is 
as though they might have labora- 
tories of their own.” 

“Well, if they produce mini- 
electronic devices and fine bio- 
chemicals — isn’t that to be 
expected?” 

“Yes, but — Gottstein, I don’t 
know. I fear my ignorance.” 

A moderately long pause ensued. 
Gottstein finally broke it. “Mon- 
tez, I take it you are telling me all 
this so that I will be careful — so 
that I will try to find out what the 
Lunarites are doing?” 

“I suppose that’s about it,” said 
Montez unhappily. 

“But you don’t even know that 
they’re doing anything at all.” 

“1 feel that they are.” 

Gottstein said, “It’s odd, then. I 
should be trying to talk you out of 
all this fearful mysticism of yours — 
but it’s odd — ” 

“What is?” 

“The same vessel that brought 
me to the Moon brought some one 
else. I mean, a large party came, 
but one face in particular triggered 
something in my memory. I didn’t 
talk to him — had no occasion to — 
and I dismissed the matter. But 
now our talk is pushing a button 
and he suddenly comes back to 
mind.” 

“Yes?” 

“I was on a committee once that 
dealt with Electron Pump matters. 
A question of safety arose.” He 
smiled briefly. “Earth’s lost nerve. 



you might say. We worry about 
safety everywhere — and a good 
thing, damn it, lost nerve or not. 
The details escape me, but in con- 
nection with that hearing 1 saw the 
man I saw again on the vessel. I’m 
convinced of it.” 

“Does that have significance, do 
you think?” 

“I’m not sure. I associate that 
face with something disturbing. 
What it was may come, back to 
me. In any case, I had better get a 
list of the passengers and see if any 
name means something to me. Too 
bad, Montez, but 1 think you’re 
getting me started.” 

“Not bad at all,” said Montez. 
“I’m glad of it. As for this man — 
he may be only a tourist of no 
consequence who will be gone in 
two weeks, but I am glad to have 
you on the alert.” 

Gottstein did not seem to be 
listening. “He is a physicist, or a 
scientist of some sort,” he mut- 
tered. “I’m certain of it and I as- 
sociate him with danger — ”

<<TTELLO,” Selene said 
XX cheerfully. 

The Earthman turned. Recog- 
nition took almost no time at all. 
“Selene. Am I right? Selene?” 
“Right. Correctly pronounced. 
Enjoying yourself?” 

The Earthman said gravely, 
“Very much. Being here makes me 
realize how unique our century is. 
Not so long ago I was on Earth, 
feeling tired of my world, tired of 
myself. Then I thought, “Well, if 
I were living a hundred years ago, 
the only way I could leave the world 



20 



GALAXY 




would be to die, but now— I can go 
to the Moon.” He smiled, and the 
smile too was grave. 

Selene asked, “Are you happier 
now that you’re on the Moon?” 

“A little.” He looked about. 
“Don’t you have a crowd of tour- 
ists to nurse?” 

“Not today. It’s my day off. 
Who knows, I may take off two or 
three. It’s a dull job.” 

“What a shame then — you bump 
into a tourist on your day off.” 

“I didn’t bump into you. I came 
looking for you. You’re a hard one 
to find, too. You shouldn’t wander 
off by yourself.” 

The Earthman gazed at her with 
interest. “Why look for me? Are 
you fond of Earthmen?” 

“No,” she said with easy frank- 
ness. “I’m sick of them. I dislike 
them on principle and being con- 
stantly associated with them in my 
job makes it worse.” 

“Yet you came looking for me 
and there isn’t a way on Earth — on 
Moon, I mean — I can convince 
myself I am young and handsome.” 
“It wouldn’t help if you were. 
Earthmen don’t interest me ro- 
mantically, as everyone but Barron 
knows.” 

“Then why the search?” 
“Because there are other ways of 
being interested and because Bar- 
ron is interested.” 

“And who is Barron? Your 
boy-friend?” 

Selene laughed. “Barron Neville. 
He’s a lot more than a boy and a lot 
more than a friend. We have sex 
when we feel like it.” 

“Well, that’s what I meant. Do 
you have children?” 

“One boy. He’s ten. He spends 



most of his time in the boys’ com- 
pound. To spare you the next ques- 
tion, he’s not Barron’s. I may have 
a child by Barron if we’re still to- 
gether when I’m assigned another 
child— if I’m assigned another 
child. I’m pretty sure I will be.” 
“You’re quite frank.” 

“About things I don’t believe 
require secrecy? Of course. Now, 
what would you like to do?” 

They had been walking along a 
corridor of milk-white rock, into 
the glazed surface of which were 
set dusky “Moon gems” that lay 
about for the taking in most sec- 
tions of the Lunar surface. She 
wore sandals that scarcely seemed 
to touch the ground. He wore thick- 
soled boots, which leadenly helped 
weigh him down to keep his steps 
from becoming torture. 

The corridor was one-way. Oc- 
casionally a small electric cart 
would overtake them and move 
past almost silently. 

The Earthman asked, “What 
would 1 like to do? That is a broad- 
beamed invitation. Would you care 
to set boundary conditions so that 
my answer may not innocently of- 
fend you?” 

“Are you a physicist?” 

The Earthman hesitated. “Why 
do you ask?” 

“Just to hear what you will say. 
I know you’re a physicist.” 
“How?” 

“No one says ‘set boundary 
conditions’ unless he is. Especially 
if the first thing he wants to see 
on the Moon is the proton 
synchrotron.” 

“Is that why you came looking 
for me? Because you thought I 
might be a physicist?” 



THE GODS THEMSELVES

“That’s why Barron sent me 
looking for you. You see, he is a 
physicist. I came because I thought 
you rather unusual for an 
Earthman.” 

“In what way?” 

“Nothing terribly complimen- 
tary — if it’s compliments you’re 
fishing for. It’s just that you seem 
not to like Earthmen.” 

“How can you tell that?” 

“I watched you look at the others 
in the party. Besides, I can always 
tell. Earthies who don’t like Earth- 
ies tend to stay on the Moon. 
Which brings me back to the 
question— what would you like to 
do? And I’ll set the boundary con- 
ditions. I mean, as far as sight- 
seeing is concerned.” 

The Earthman looked at her 
sharply. “That’s peculiar, Selene. 
You have a day off. Your job is 
sufficiently uninteresting or dis- 
tasteful for you to be glad to have 
that day off and you would be wil- 
ling to make it two or three. Yet 
your way of spending it is to vol- 
unteer to resume your job for me 
particularly. Just because of a little 
interest?” 

“Barron’s interest. He’s busy 
now and there's no harm in my 
entertaining you until he’s ready. 
Besides, it’s different. Can’t you see 
it’s different? On my job I’m riding 
herd on a couple of dozen Earth- 
ies - Don't you mind my using 
the term?” 

“I use it myself.” 

“But you use it as an Earthman. 
Some Earth people consider it a 
term of derision and resent it when 
a Lunarite uses it.” 

“You mean when a Lunie uses 
it?” 



Selene flushed. “Yes. That’s 
about it.” 

“Well, then, let’s neither of us 
cry over words. Go ahead— you 
were telling me about your job.” 
“On my job there are these 
Earthies I have to keep from killing 
themselves and whom I have to 
take here and there and give little 
speeches to and make sure they eat 
and drink and walk by the book. 
They see their little pet sights and 
do their little pet things, and 1 
have to be polite and motherly. 
“Awful,” said the Earthman. 
“But you and I can do as we 
please, I hope, and you are willing 
to take your chances and I don’t 
have to watch what I say.” 

“I told you that you’re perfectly 
welcome to call me an Earthie.” 
“All right, then. I’ll have a bus- 
man’s holiday— there’s an Earthie 
expression for you. What would 
you like to do?” 

“1 want to see the proton 
synchrotron.” 

“Not that. Maybe Barron can 
arrange it. Talk to him.” 

“Well, if 1 can’t see the synchro- 
tron I don’t know what else there 
is to see. I know the radio telescope 
is on the other side, but I don't 
suppose there's any novelty in it. 
You tell me. What doesn’t the 
average tourist get to see?” 

“A number of things. There are 
the algae rooms- not the anti- 
septic processing plants, which 
you’ve seen— but the farms them- 
selves. However, the smell is pretty 
strong there and I don’t suppose an 
Earthie — Earthman — would find it 
particularly appetizing. Earthmen 
have enough trouble with the food, 
as it is.” 



22 



GALAXY 




“Does that surprise you? Have 
you ever tasted Earth food?” 

“Not really. I probably wouldn't 
like it, though. It all depends on 
what you're used to.” 

“I suppose so,” said the Earth- 
man, signing. “If you ate a real 
steak you’d probably gag at the fat 
and fiber.” 

“We could go to the outskirts 
where the new corridors are being 
driven into bedrock, but you’ll 
have to wear special protective gar- 
ments. There are the factories — ” 
“You make the choice, Selene.” 
“I will — if you will tell me some- 
thing honestly.” 

“1 can’t promise without hearing 
the question.” 

“I said that Earthies who don’t 
like Earthies tend to stay on the 
Moon. You didn’t correct me. Do 
you intend to stay on the Moon?” 

T he Earthman stared at the 
toes of his clumsy boots. He 
said, “I had trouble getting a visa 
to the Moon. They said I might be 
too old for the trip and that if I 
stayed any length of time 1 might 
find it impossible to return to 
Earth. So I told them I planned to 
stay on the Moon permanently.” 
“Were you lying?” 

“I wasn’t sure at the time. But 
now I think I’ll stay here.” 

“I should have thought that they 
would have been less willing than 
ever to let you go under those 
conditions.” 

“Why?” 

“Generally the Earth authorities 
don’t like to send physicists to the 
Moon on a permanent basis.” 

The Earthman’s lips twitched. 
“I had no trouble on that ground.” 



“Well, then — if you're going to 
be one of us 1 think you ought to 
visit the gymnasium. Earthies 
often want to but we don’t en- 
courage them as a general rule — 
though it’s not forbidden outright. 
With immigrants, it’s different — ” 
“Why?” 

“Well, for one thing, we exercise 
in the nude or near-nude. Why 
not?” She sounded aggrieved, as 
though weary of repeating a de- 
fensive position. “The temperature 
is controlled. The environment is 
clean. It’s just that when people 
from Earth are present, nudity can 
become unsettling. Some Earthies 
are shocked. Some are titillated. 
Some are both. Well, we’re not 
going to dress in the gymnasium for 
their sake and we’re not going to 
cope with them, either — we just 
keep them out.” 

“But immigrants?” 

“They have to get used to it. In 
the end they’ll be discarding 
clothes, too. And they’ll need the 
gymnasium even more than the 
native Lunarites do.” 

“I’ll be honest with you, Selene. 
If I encounter female nudity. I’ll 
definitely find it titillating. I’m not 
quite so old that 1 won’t.” 

“Well, titillate then,” she said 
indifferently. “But keep it to your- 
self. Agreed?” 

“Do we have to get undressed, 
too?” He looked at her with 
amused interest. 

“As spectators? No. We could, 
but we don’t have to. You would 
feel uncomfortable this early in 
the game and you wouldn’t be a 
particularly inspiring sight to the 
rest of us.” 

“You are frank.” 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



23 




“Do you think you would be a 
treat in the altogether? Be honest. 
And as for myself — I have no wish 
to put you under a strain by titillat- 
ing you. So we might both just as 
well stay clothed.” 

“Will there be any objection? I 
mean to my being there as an 
Earthie of uninspiring appearance?” 
“Not if I’m with you.” 

“Very well, then, Selene. Is it 
far away?” 

“We are there. Just through 
here.” 

“Ah, then you were planning to 
come here all the time.” 

“I thought it might be 
interesting.” 

“Why?” 

Selene smiled suddenly. “I just 
thought.” 

T he Earthman shook his head. 

“I’m beginning to get the idea 
you never just think. Let me guess. 
If I’m to stay on the Moon I will 
need to exercise now and then in 
order to keep muscles, bones and 
all my organs, perhaps, in 
condition.” 

“Quite true. So do all of us, but 
immigrants from Earth in partic- 
ular. The day will come when the 
gymnasium will be a daily grind 
for you.” 

They stepped through a doorway 
and the Earthman stared in as- 
tonishment. “This is the first place 
I’ve seen that looks like Earth.” 
“In what way?” 

“Why, it’s big. I didn’t imagine 
you would have such big rooms on 
the Moon. Desks, office machinery 
— women at the desks — ” 
“Bare-breasted women,” said 
Selene solemnly. 



“That part isn’t Earthlike, I 
admit.” 

“We’ve got a hold-chute, too, 
and an elevator for Earthies. There 
are many levels. But wait.” 

She approached a woman at one 
of the nearer desks, talking in a 
low, rapid voice while the Earth- 
man stared at everything with 
amiable curiosity. 

Selene returned. “No trouble. 
And it turns out we’re going to have 
a melee. A rather good one — I 
know the teams.” 

“This place is impressive. 
Really.” 

“If you still refer to its size — it’s 
not nearly big enough. We have 
three gymnasiums. This is the 
largest, such as it is — ” 

“I’m somehow pleased that in 
the Spartan surroundings of the 
Moon, you can afford to waste so 
much space on frivolity.” 
“Frivolity?” Selene sounded 
offended. “Why do you think this 
is frivolity?” 

“Melees. Some sort of game?” 
“You might call them a game. 
On Earth you can have such things 
for sport — ten men doing, ten 
thousand watching. It’s not so on 
the Moon. What’s frivolous for you 
is necessary for us. This way — 
we’ll take the elevator, which 
means a little waiting maybe.” 
“Didn’t mean to get you angry.” 
“I’m not really angry but you 
must be reasonable. You Earthmen 
have been adapted to Earth gravity 
for all the three hundred million 
years since life crawled onto dry 
land. You get by even if you don’t 
exercise. We’ve had no time at all 
to adapt to Moon gravity.” 

“You look different enough.” 



24 



GALAXY 




“If you’re born and reared under 
Moon gravity your bones and 
muscles are naturally slimmer and 
less massive than an Earthie’s are, 
but that’s superficial. There isn’t 
a bodily function we possess, how- 
ever subtle — digestion, rates of 
hormonal secretions— that isn’t 
maladjusted to gravity and that 
doesn’t require a deliberate regi- 
men of exercise. If we can arrange 
exercise in the form of fun and 
games that does not make it 
frivolity. Here’s the elevator.” 

The Earthman hung back in 
momentary alarm. 

Selene said, “I suppose you’re 
going to tell me it looks like a 
wickerwork basket. Every Earth- 
man who uses it says so. With 
Moon gravity, it doesn’t have to 
be any more substantial.” 

The elevator moved down slowly. 
Selene and the Earthman were the 
only ones on board. 

He said, “I suspect this isn’t 
much used.” 

Selene smiled again. “You’re 
right. The hold-chute is much more 
popular and much more fun.” 
“What is it?” 

“Exactly what the name implies. 
Here we are. We had to drop only 
two levels. The chute is just a ver- 
tical tube you can drop through, 
with hand-holds. We don’t en- 
courage Earthies to use it.” 

“Too risky?” 

“Not in itself. You can climb 
down as though it were a ladder. 
However, there are always young- 
sters swinging down at considerable 
speed and Earthies don’t know how 
to keep out of the way. Collisions 
are always discomforting. But 
you’ll get to use the chute in time. 



In fact, what you’ll see now is a 
kind of large hold-chute designed 
for recklessness.” 

S HE led him to a circular railing, 
around which a number of in- 
dividuals were leaning and talking. 
All were more or less in the nude. 
Sandals were common and usually 
a hip purse was slung over one 
shoulder. Some wore briefs. One 
girl was scooping a greenish mash 
out of a container and eating it. 

The Earthman wrinkled his nose 
slightly as he passed that one. He 
said, “The dental problem must 
be severe on the Moon.” 

Selene nodded. “If we ever get 
the chance, we’ll select for an eden- 
tate jaw.” 

“Toothlessness?” 

“Maybe not complete. We might 
keep the incisors and canines for 
cosmetic reasons and for occasion- 
ally useful tasks. They’re easily 
cleaned, too. But why should we 
want useless molars? They’re just 
a hangover from an Earthie past.” 
“Are you making any progress?” 
“No,” she said stiffly. “Genetic 
engineering is illegal. Earth in- 
sists.” She leaned over the railing. 
“They call this the Moon’s 
playground.” 

The Earthman looked down into 
a large cylindrical construction 
with smooth pink walls to which 
metal bars were attached in what 
seemed a random configuration. 
Here and there a bar stretched 
across a portion of the cylinder, 
sometimes across its entire width. 
The structure was perhaps four or 
five hundred feet deep and about 
fifty feet across. 

No one seemed to be paying par- 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



25 




ticular attention either to the play- 
ground or to the Earthman. Some 
looked at him indifferently as he 
passed — seeming to weigh his 
clothed state, his facial appearance 
— and then turned away. Some 
made a casual hand gesture in 
Selene’s direction before turning 
away, but all turned away. The 
no-interest signal, however sub- 
dued, could not have been more 
blatant. 

The Earthman turned to the 
cylindrical opening. He saw slim 
figures at the bottom, foreshort- 
ened because they were seen from 
above. Some wore wisps of clothing 
in red, some in blue. Two teams, he 
decided. Clearly the dress served 
protective functions, since all wore 
gloves and sandals, protective 
bands about knees and elbows. 
Some wore brief bands about the 
hips, some about the chests. 

“Oh,” he muttered. “Men and 
women.” 

Selene said, “Right. The sexes 
compete equally and the idea in 
dress is to prevent the uncontrolled 
swinging of parts that might 
hamper the guided fall. There is 
a sexual difference there and in 
vulnerability to pain. The clothing 
is not for modesty.” 

The Earthman said, “I think I’ve 
read of this.” 

“You may have, though not 
much seems to get out. Not that we 
have any objection, but the ter- 
restrial government prefers to keep 
news of the Moon to a minimum.” 

“Why, Selene?” 

“You’re an Earthman. You tell 
me. Our theory is that we embar- 
rass Earth. Or at least the Earth 
government.” 



Two individuals were rising 
rapidly on opposite sides of the 
cylinder now. The patter of light 
drums was heard in the back- 
ground. At first the climbers 
seemed to be going up a ladder, 
rung by rung, but their speed in- 
creased and by the time they were 
halfway up, they were merely 
striking each hold as they passed, 
making an ostentatious slapping 
noise. 

“Couldn’t do that as gracefully 
on Earth,” said the Earthman ad- 
miringly. “Or at all,” he amended. 

“It’s not just the low gravity,” 
said Selene. “Try it, and you’ll find 
that climb takes endless hours of 
practice.” 

T he climbers reached the rail- 
ing and swung to a headstand. 
They performed simultaneous 
somersaults and began to fall. 

“They can move quickly when 
they want to,” said the Earthman. 

“Umm,” said Selene, through 
the patter of applause. “I suspect 
that when Earthmen — I mean the 
real Earthmen, the ones who have 
never even visited the Moon — 
think of moving around the Moon, 
they think of the surface and of 
spacesuits. That’s often slow, of 
course. The mass, with the space- 
suit added, is huge and means high 
inertia.” 

“Quite right,” said the Earth- 
man. “I’ve seen the classic motion 
pictures of the early astronauts 
that all schoolchildren see. The 
movements are like those under- 
water. The picture becomes im- 
printed and stays with us even 
when we know better.” 

“You’d be surprised how fast 



26 



GALAXY 




we can move on the surface these 
days, spacesuit and all,” said Se- 
lene. “And here, underground, 
without spacesuits, we can move as 
quickly as people do on Earth. The 
slower whip of gravity is made up 
for by the proper use of muscles.” 

“But you can move slowly, too.” 
The Earthman was watching the 
acrobats. They had gone up with 
speed and were going down with 
deliberate slowness. They were 
floating, slapping the hand-holds 
to delay the drop rather than, as 
before, to accelerate the rise. They 
reached the bottom and two,others 
replaced them. And then two more. 
And then two more. Alternate 
pairs from each team competed in 
virtuosity. 

Each pair went up in unison — 
each pair rose and fell in a more 
complicated pattern. One pair 
kicked off simultaneously to cross 
the tube in a low parabola, each 
reaching the hand-hold the other 
had abandoned and somehow 
skimming past the other in midair 
without touching. That stunt 
evoked loud applause. 

The Earthman said, “I suspect 
I lack the experience to appreciate 
the finer points of skill. Are these 
all native Lunarites?” 

“They have to be,” said Selene. 
“The gymnasium is open to all 
Lunar citizens and some immi- 
grants are fairly good, considering. 
For this kind of virtuosity, how- 
ever, you must depend on babies 
conceived and born here. They 
have the proper physical adaptation 
and get the proper childhood train- 
ing. Most of these performers are 
under eighteen.” 

“I imagine it’s dangerous — even 



at Moon’s gravity levels.” 

“Broken bones aren’t too un- 
common. 1 don’t think there’s been 
an actual death, but I know of at 
least one case of broken spine and 
paralysis. That was a terrible acci- 
dent — I was actually watching — 
Oh, wait now — we’re going to have 
the ad libs.” 

“The what?” 

“Till now, we’ve had set pieces. 
The climbs were according to a 
fixed pattern.” 

The percussion beat seemed 
softer as one climber rose and sud- 
denly launched into midair. He 
caught a transverse bar one- 
handed, circled it once vertically 
and let go. 

The Earthman watched closely. 
He said, “Amazing. He gets around 
those bars exactly like a gibbon.” 
“A what?” asked Selene. 

“A gibbon. A kind of ape — in 
fact, the only ape still existing in 
the wild. They — ” He looked at 
Selene’s expression and said, “1 
don’t mean it as an insult, Selene 
they are graceful creatures.” 

Selene said, frowning, “I've seen 
pictures of apes.” 

“You probably haven’t seen 
gibbons in motion. I dare say that 
Earthies might call Lunarites ‘gib- 
bons’ and mean it insultingly, 
about on the level of what you 
mean by ‘Earthie.’ But 1 don’t 
mean it so.” 

He leaned both elbows on the 
railing and watched the action. It 
was like dancing in the air. He said, 
“How do you treat Earth immi- 
grants here on the Moon, Selene? 
I mean immigrants who mean to 
stay here for life. Since they lack 
true Lunarite abilities — ” 



THE GODS THEMSELVES

“That makes no difference. 
Immies are citizens. There’s 
no discrimination — no legal dis- 
crimination.” 

“What does that mean? No legal 
discrimination?” 

“Well, you said it yourself. There 
are some things they can’t do. 
There are differences. The medical 
problems are different and they’ve 
usually had a worse medical history. 
If they come in middle age they 
look — old.” 

The Earthman looked away, 
embarrassed. “Can they inter- 
marry? 1 mean, immigrants and 
Lunarites.” 

“Certainly. That is, they can 
interbreed.” 

“Yes, that’s what 1 meant.” 

“Of course. No reason why an 
immigrant can’t have some worth- 
while genes. Heavens, my father 
was an Immie, though I’m second- 
generation Lunarite on my 
mother’s side.” 

“1 suppose your father must 
have come when he was quite — 
Oh, good Lord — ” He froze at the 
railing, then drew a shuddering 
breath. “I thought he was going to 
miss that bar.” 

“Not a chance,” said Selene. 
“That’s Marco Fore. He likes to 
reach out at the last moment. 
Actually it’s bad form to do so and 
a real champion doesn’t. Still — My 
father was twenty-two when he 
arrived.” 

“1 suppose that’s the way. Young 
enough to be adaptable and without 
emotional complications linking 
one to Earth. From the standpoint 
of the Earthie male, I imagine it 
must be rather nice to have a sexual 
attachment with a — ” 



“Sexual attachment!” Selene’s 
amusement seemed to cover a very 
real sense of shock. “You don’t 
suppose my father had sex with 
my mother. If my mother heard 
you say that, she’d set you right in, 
a hurry.” 

“But—” 

“Artificial insemination, for 
goodness’ sake. Sex with an 
Earthman?” 

The Earthman looked solemn. 
“I thought you said there was no 
discrimination.” 

“That’s not discrimination. 
That’s a matter of physical fact. An 
Earthman can’t handle the gravity 
field properly. However practiced 
he might be — under the stress of 
passion he might revert. I wouldn’t 
risk it. The clumsy fool might snap 
his arm or teg or — worse — mine. 
Gene mixtures are one thing — sex 
is quite another.” 

“I’m sorry. Isn’t artificial insemi- 
nation against the law?” 

She was watching the gymnastics 
with absorption. “That’s Marco 
Fore again. When he isn’t trying to 
be uselessly spectacular he really 
is good — and his sister is almost 
as good. When they work together 
it’s a poem of motion. Look at 
them now. They’ll come together 
and circle the same bar as though 
they had a single body. He’s a little 
too flamboyant at times, but you 
can’t fault his muscular control. 
Yes, artificial insemination is 
against Earth’s law, but it’s allowed 
for medical reasons — and here that 
term is pretty broad.” 

ALL the acrobats had now 
climbed to the top and were 
in a great circle just below the 



28 



GALAXY 




railing — reds on one side, blues on 
the other. All arms on the side of 
the interior were raised and the 
applause was loud. Quite a crowd 
had gathered at the rail. 

“You ought to have some seating 
arrangement,” said the Earthman. 

“Not at all. This isn’t a show. 
This is exercise. We don’t en- 
courage any more spectators than 
can stand comfortably about the 
railing. We’re supposed to be down 
there, not up here.” 

“You mean you can do that sort 
of thing, Selene?” 

“After a fashion, of course. Any 
Lunarite can. I’m not as good as 
they are. I haven’t joined any 
teams — The melee’s going to start 
now, a free-for-all. This is the really 
dangerous part. All ten are going 
to be in the air and each side is 
going to try to send members of 
the other side into a fall.” 

“A real fall?” 

“As real as possible.” 

“Are there injuries occasionally?” 
“Occasionally. In theory this 
sort of thing is frowned upon. 
Courting injury is considered frivo- 
lous and we don’t have so large a 
population that we can afford to 
incapacitate anyone. Still, the 
melee is popular and we can’t raise 
the votes to outlaw it.” 

“Which side do you vote on, 
Selene?” 

Selene blushed. “Oh, never mind. 
You watch this!” 

The percussion rhythm had sud- 
denly grown thunderous and each 
of the individuals in the huge well 
darted outward like an arrow. 
There was wild confusion in mid- 
air, but when the contestants parted 
again each ended firmly on a grip 



bar. Next came the tension of wait- 
ing. One contestant launched him- 
self. Another followed — and the 
air was again filled with flashing 
bodies. Over and over it happened. 

Selene said, “The scoring is 
intricate. There is a point for every 
launch, a point for every touch, two 
points for every miss inflicted, ten 
points for a grounding. And there 
are various penalties for various 
kinds of fouling.” 

“Who keeps the score?” 
“Umpires make the preliminary 
decisions and television tapes are 
studied in the event of appeals. But 
often even the tapes can’t decide 
matters.” 

A sudden excited cry arose when 
a girl in blue moved past a boy in 
red and slapped his flank resound- 
ingly. The boy who received the 
blow had writhed away, but not 
successfully. Grabbing at a bar 
with improper balance, he struck 
the wall ungracefully with his knee. 

“Where were his eyes?” de- 
manded Selene indignantly. “He 
didn’t see her coming.” 

The action grew hotter and the 
Earthman tired of trying to make 
sense of the knotted flights. Oc- 
casionally a leaper touched a bar 
and did not retain hold. Those were 
the times when spectators leaned 
over the railing as though ready to 
launch themselves into space. 

Once Marco Fore was struck in 
the wrist and someone cried 
“Foul!” 

Fore missed his hand-hold and 
fell. To the Earthman’s eyes the 
fall was slow. Fore’s lithe body 
twisted and turned, reaching for 
bar after bar, without quite making 
it. The others waited. All maneu- 

29 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 




vering was suspended during the 
fall. 

Fore was moving quite rapidly 
now, though twice he had slowed 
himself without quite being able to 
maintain a hold. 

He was nearly to the ground 
when a sudden spidery lunge caught 
a transverse bar with the right leg 
and he hung suspended and swing- 
ing, headdown, about ten feet 
above the ground. Arms outspread, 
he paused while the applause rang 
out, then he twisted upright and 
jumped into a rapid climb. 

The Earthman said, “Was he 
fouled?” 

“If Jean Wong actually grabbed 
Marco’s wrist instead of pushing 
it, it was a foul. The umpire has 
ruled a fair block, however, and 1 
don’t think Marco will appeal. He 
fell a lot farther than he had to. He 
likes these last-minute saves. Some 
day he’ll miscalculate and hurt 
himself. Oh, oh.” 

The Earthman looked up in sud- 
den inquiry, but Selene’s eyes 
were not upon him. 

She said, “That’s someone from 
the Commissioner’s office and he 
must be looking for you.” 

“Why?” 

“I don’t see why he would come 
here to find anyone else. You’re the 
unusual one.” 

“But there’s no reason — ” began 
the Earthman. 

Yet the messenger, who himself 
had the build of an Earthman or an 
Earth immigrant and who seemed 
uneasy under the stares of a couple 
of dozen slight nude figures who 
seemed to tint their scorn with in- 
difference, came directly toward 
him. 



“Sir, Commissioner Gottstein re- 
quests that you accompany me — ”

ARRON NEVILLE’S quarters 
were harsher than Selene’s. 
His books were on bold display. 
His computer outlet was unmasked 
in one corner and his large desk was 
in disarray. His windows were 
blank. 

Selene entered, folded her arms 
and said, “If you live like a slob, 
Barron, how do you expect your 
thoughts to be neat?” 

“I’ll manage,” Barron said 
grumpily. “How is it you haven’t 
brought the Earthman with you?” 

“The Commissioner got to him 
first. The new Commissioner.” 

“Gottstein?” 

“That’s right. Why weren’t you 
ready sooner?” 

“Because it took time to find 
out about him. I won’t work blind.” 

Selene said, “Well, then, we’ll 
just have to wait.” 

Neville bit at a thumbnail and 
inspected the result severely. “I 
don’t know whether I ought to like 
the situation or not. What did you 
think of him?” 

“I like him,” said Selene defi- 
nitely. “He was rather pleasant, 
considering he was an Earthie. He 
let me guide him. He was inter- 
ested. He made no judgments. He 
didn’t patronize. And I didn’t go 
out of my way to avoid insulting 
him, either.” 

“Did he ask again about the 
synchrotron?” 

She found herself resorting to a 




30 



GALAXY 




tactic she normally despised and 
seldom used — evasion. “He didn’t 
have to.” 

“Why not?” 

“I told him you wanted to see 
him and 1 said you were a physi- 
cist. So 1 imagine that when you 
get together, he’ll ask you what- 
ever it is he wants to ask.” 

“Didn’t he think it strange that 
he should be talking to a female 
tourist-guide who just happens to 
know a physicist?” 

“Why strange? I said you were 
my sex partner. There’s no account- 
ing for sexual attraction and a 
physicist may well condescend to a 
lowly tourist-guide.” 

“Shut up, Selene.” 

“Oh, for — Look, Barron, it 
seems to me that if he were spin- 
ning some sort of fancy web — if 
he approached me because he plan- 
ned to get to you through me — 
he would have shown some trace of 
anxiety. The more complicated and 
silly any plot, the more rickety it 
is and the more anxious the plotter. 
I deliberately behaved casually. 
I took him to a gymnastics show.” 
“And?” 

“And he was interested. Relaxed 
and interested. Whatever he has on 
his mind, it isn’t involuted.” 
“You’re sure of that? The Com- 
missioner got to him before I did. 
You consider that good?” 

“Why should I consider it bad? 
An open invitation to a meeting of 
some sort delivered in front of a 
couple of dozen Lunarites isn’t 
particularly involuted, either.” 
Neville leaned back, hands 
clasped at the nape of his neck. 
“Selene, please don’t insist on mak- 
ing judgments when I don’t ask you 



to. It’s irritating. The man is not a 
physicist in the first place. Did he 
tell you he was?” 

Selene paused to think. “I called 
him a physicist. He didn’t deny it 
but I don’t recall that he actually 
said he was. And yet — I’m sure 
he is.” 

“It’s a lie of omission, Selene. 
He may be a physicist in his own 
mind, but the fact is that he isn’t 
trained as a physicist and he doesn’t 
work as one. He has had scientific 
training. I’ll grant, but he has no 
scientific job of any kind. He 
couldn’t get one. There isn’t a lab 
on Earth that would give him 
working room. He happens to be 
on Fred Hallam’s crud list and 
Hallam has been top man there 
for a long time. 

“Are you sure?” 

“Believe me, I checked. Didn’t 
you just criticize me for taking 
so long? And his background 
sounds so good that it’s too good.” 
“Why too good? I don’t see what 
you’re getting at.” 

“Doesn’t it seem to you we ought 
to trust him? After all, he’s got a 
grievance against Earth.” 

“You can certainly argue that 
way — if your facts are right.” 
“Oh, my facts are right — at 
least in the sense that they’re what 
turns up, if you dig for background 
on your Earthie. But maybe we’re 
supposed to argue that way.” 
“Barron, that’s disgusting. How 
can you weave these conspiracy 
theories into everything? Ben didn’t 
sound — ” 

“Ben?” Neville asked sardon- 
ically. 

“Ben,” repeated Selene firmly. 
“Ben didn’t sound like a man wjth 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



31 




a grievance or like a man trying to 
make me think he sounded like 
a man with a grievance.” 

“No, but he managed to make 
you think he was someone to be 
liked. You did say you liked him, 
didn’t you? With emphasis? Maybe 
that’s exactly what he was trying to 
do.” 

“I’m not that easy to fool and 
you know it.” 

“Well, I’ll just have to wait till 
I see him.” 

“The hell with you, Barron. 
I’ve associated with thousands of 
Earthies of all kinds. It’s my Job. 
And you have no reason whatever 
to speak sarcastically about my 
judgment. You know you have 
every reason to trust it.” 

“All right. We’ll see. Don’t get 
angry. It’s just that we’ll have to 
wait now. And as long as we 
must — ” He rose lithely to his feet. 
“Guess what I’m thinking.” 

“I don’t have to.” Selene rose 
as smoothly and with an almost 
invisible motion of her feet slid 
sideways, well away from him. 
“But think it by yourself. I’m not 
in the mood.” 

“Are you annoyed because I’ve 
impugned your judgment?” 

“I’m annoy^ because — Oh, 
hell, why don’t you keep your room 
in better condition?” 

And she left.

«T WOULD like,” said Gott- 
X stein, “to offer you some 
Earthside luxury. Doctor, but 1 
have been allowed to bring none. 
The good people of the Moon re- 
sent the artificial barriers imposed 



by special treatment for men from 
Earth. It seems better to soothe 
their sensibilities by assuming the 
Lunarite pose as far as possible, 
though I’m afraid my gait will 
give me away. Their confounded 
gravity is impossible.” 

The Earthman said, “I find this 
so also. I congratulate you on your 
new post.” 

“Not yet quite mine, sir.” 

“Still, my congratulations. I 
can’t help wondering why you have 
asked to see me.” 

“We were shipmates. We arrived 
not so long ago on the same 
vessel.” 

The Earthman waited politely. 
Gottstein said, “And my ac- 
quaintance with you is a longer one 
than that. We met briefly some 
years ago.” 

The Earthman said quietly, “I’m 
afraid I don’t recall — ” 

“I’m not surprised. There is no 
reason for you to remember. Once 
I was on the staff of Senator Burt, 
who headed — still heads, in fact — 
the Committee on Technology and 
Environment. It was at a time when 
he was rather anxious to get the 
goods on Hallam — Frederick 

Hallam.” 

The Earthman seemed quite 
suddenly to sit a little straighter. 
“Did you know Hallam?” 
“You’re the second person to ask 
me that since my coming to the 
Moon. Yes, I did. Not intimately. 
And I’ve known others who’ve met 
him. Oddly enough, their opinion 
usually coincided with mine. For a 
person apparently idolized by the 
planet, Hallam inspired little 
personal liking on the part of those 
acquainted with him.” 



32 



GALAXY 




“Little? None at all, I think," 
said the Earthman. 

Gottstein ignored the inter- 
ruption. “It was my job at the time 
— or at least, my assignment from 
the Senator- to investigate the 
Electron Pump and see if its 
establishment and growth were 
accompanied by undue waste and 
personal profit-taking. Both were 
a legitimate concern for what was 
essentially a watchdog committee, 
but the Senator was, between us, 
hoping to find something to 
damage Hallam. The Senator 
was anxious to break the strangle- 
hold that man was gaining on the 
scientific establishment. But the 
Senator failed.” 

“That much would be obvious. 
Hallam today is stronger than 
ever.” 

“We discovered no graft to speak 
of — certainly none that could 
be traced to Hallam. The man is 
rigidly honest.” 

“In that sense he is, I am sure. 
Power has its own market value, 
not necessarily measured in credit- 
bills.” 

“But what interested me at the 
time, though it was something 1 
could not then follow up, was that 
I did come across someone 
whose complaint was not against 
Hallam’s power but against the 
Electron Pump itself. I was present 
at the interview although 1 did not 
conduct it. You were the com- 
plainant, were you not?” 

The Earthman said cautiously, 
“I remember the incident, but I 
still don’t remember you.” 

“I wondered then how anyone 
could possibly object to the 
Electron Pump on scientific 



grounds. You impressed me suf- 
ficiently for something to stir when 
I saw you on the ship — and even- 
tually the memory came back. 

I have not referred to the passenger 
list but let me check my powers of 
recall. ArenT you Dr. Benjamin 
Andrew Denison?” 

The Earthman sighed. “Ben- 
jamin Allan Denison. Yes. But why 
does this come up now? The truth 
is. Commissioner, I don’t want to 
drag up the past. I’m here on the 
Moon and anxious to make a new 
start. Damn it, I considered 
changing my name.” 

“That wouldn’t have helped. 
It was your face I recognized. I 
have no objection to your new life. 
Dr. Denison. I would not in any 
way interfere. But I would like to 
pry a little for reasons that do not 
directly involve you. I don’t re- 
member, quite, your objection to 
the Electron Pump. Could you en- 
lighten me?” 

D ENISON’S head bent. The 
silence lengthened and Gott- 
stein did not interrupt. He even 
stifled a small clearing of the 
throat. 

Denison said, “Truly, it was 
nothing. It was a guess I made — 
a fear about the alteration in the 
intensity of the strong nuclear 
field. Nothing!” 

“Nothing?” Gottstein did clear 
his throat now. “Please don’t mind 
if I strive to understand this. I 
told you that you interested me at 
the time. I was unable to follow up 
your theories then and I doubt 
that I could dig the information out 
of the records now. The whole thing 
is classified — the Senator did very 



the GODS THEMSELVES 



33 




poorly at the time and he isn’t 
interested in publicity about the 
matter. Still, some details come 
back. You were once a colleague of 
Hallam’s— though not a physi- 
cist — ” 

“That’s right. I was a radio- 
chemist. So was he.” 

“Stop me if I remember in- 
correctly, but your early record 
was exceptional, right?” 

“There were objective criteria in 
my favor. I had no illusions about 
myself. 1 was a brilliant worker.” 
“Amazing how it comes back. 
Hallam, on the other hand, was 
not.” 

“Not particularly.” 

“But afterward things did not go 
well with you. In fact, when we 
interviewed you — I think you 
volunteered to see us— you were 
working for a toy manufacturer.” 
“Cosmetics,” said Denison in 
a strangled voice. “Male cosmetics. 
My x)ccupation didn’t help gain me 
a respectful hearing.” 

“No, it wouldn’t. I’m sorry. You 
were a salesman.” 

“Sales manager. I was still 
brilliant. I rose to vice-president 
before breaking off and coming to 
the Moon.” 

“Did Hallam have something to 
do with that? I mean with your 
leaving science?” 

“Commissioner,” said Denison, 
“please — it really doesn’t matter 
any longer. I was there when 
Hallam first discovered the tung- 
sten conversion and when the chain 
of events began that led to the 
Electron Pump. Exactly what 
would have happened if I had not 
been there, I can’t say. Hallam 
and I might both have been dead 



of radiation poisoning a month 
later or of a nuclear explosion 
six weeks later. I don’t know. But 
I was there and Hallam is what 
he is now, partly because of me. 
And because of my part in what- 
ever he is — 1 am what I am now. 
The hell with the details. Does 
that satisfy you? Because it will 
have to.” 

“I certainly had no affection for 
him in those days. 1 have no af- 
fection for him now, for that 
matter.” 

“Would you say that your ob- 
jection to the Electron Pump was 
inspired by your anxiety to 
destroy Hallam?” 

“I object to this cross- 
examination.” 

“Please! What I ask is not in- 
tended to be used against you. The 
information is for my own benefit. 
I am concerned about the Pump 
and about a number of things.” 

“Well, then — I suppose you 
might work out some emotional 
involvement. Because I disliked 
Hallam I was ready to believe that 
his popularity and prestige had a 
false foundation. I thought about 
the Electron Pump, hoping to find 
a flaw.” 

“And you therefore found one?” 

“No,” said Denison forcefully. 
“Not ‘therefore.’ 1 found a flaw, 
but the finding was honest. I did 
not invent a flaw merely to punc- 
ture Hallam.” 

“No question of inventing. Doc- 
tor,” said Gottstein soothingly. 
“I wouldn’t dream of any such 
implication. Yet we both know that 
in trying to determine something 
on the boundary lines of the 
known, it is necessary to make 



34 



GALAXY 




assumptions. The assumptions can 
be made over a gray area of un- 
certainty so that one can shade 
them in one direction or another 
with perfect honesty, but in accord 
with — uh — the emotions of the 
moment. You made your assump- 
tions, perhaps, on the anti- 
Hallam edge of the possible.” 
“This is a profitless discussion, 
sir. At the time I thought I had a 
valid point. However, I am not a 
physicist. I am — was — a radio- 
chemist.” 

“Hallam was a radiochemist, 
too, but he is now the most famous 
physicist in the world.” 

“He’s still a radiochemist. A 
quarter-century out of date.” 
“Not so you. You worked hard 
to become a physicist.” 

Denison smoldered. “You really 
investigated me!” 

“I told you — you impressed me. 
Amazing how it comes back. But 
now I’ll pass on to something a 
little different. Do you know a 
physicist named Peter Lamont?” 
Reluctantly Demison nodded. 
“Would you say he is brilliant?” 
“I don’t know him well enough 
to pass judgment.” 

“Would you say he knew what he 
was talking about.” 

“Barring information to the 
contrary, yes, I would say so.” 

T he Commissioner carefully 
leaned back in his seat. It had 
a spindly look about it and by 
Earth standards it would not have 
supported his weight. He asked, 
“Would you care to tell me how 
you came to know Lamont? Was 
it by reputation only? Did you 
meet?” 



“We had some direct conversa- 
tions. He was planning to write a 
history of the Electron Pump and 
how it started- a full account of 
all the legendary crap that’s grown 
around it. I was flattered that 
Lamont came to me — that he 
seemed to have found out some- 
thing about me. Damn it. Com- 
missioner, I was flattered that he 
knew I was alive. But I couldn’t 
really say much. What would 
have been the use? I would have 
gained nothing but .some sneers and 
I am tired of those - tired also of 
brooding and self-pity.” 

“Do you know anything about 
what Lamont has been doing in the 
last few years?” 

“What is it you’re thinking of. 
Commissioner?” asked Denison 
cautiously. 

“About a year ago, maybe a 
little more, Lamont spoke to 
Burt. I am not on the Senator’s 
staff any longer but we see each 
other occasionally. He talked to me 
about it. He was concerned. He 
thought Lamont might have made 
a valid point against the Electron 
Pump and yet could see no practi- 
cal way of pursuing the matter. I, 
too, was concerned—” 

“Concern everywhere,” said 
Denison sardonically. 

“But now I wonder. If Lamont 
talked to you and — ” 

“Stop. Stop right there, Com- 
missioner. I think I see you sidling 
toward a point and I don’t want 
you to move any further. If you 
expect me to tell you that Lamont 
stole my idea — that once again I 
am being treated badly — you are 
wrong. Let me tell you as force- 
fully as I can — I had no valid 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



35 




theory. Mine was purely a guess. 
It worried me. I presented it. I was 
not believed — I became dis- 
couraged. 1 gave up. 1 did not 
mention my guess in my discussion 
with Lamont — we never covered 
ground beyond the early days of 
the Pump. What he came up with 
later, however much it may have 
resembled my guess, was arrived at 
independently. His idea seems 
much more solidly founded than 
mine and to be based on rigid 
mathematical analysis. I lay 
claim to no priority.” 

“You seem to know about 
Lamont’s theory.” 

“It made the rounds in recent 
months. The fellow can’t publish 
and no one takes him seriously, 
but it was passed along the grape- 
vine. It even reached me.” 

“I see. Doctor. But I take 
Lamont seriously. To me the 
warning was second time around, 
you understand. The report of the 
first warning — yours — had never 
reached the Senator. It had 
nothing to do with financial ir- 
regularities, which were then on his 
mind. The actual head of the in- 
vestigating panel — not myself — 
considered it (you will forgive me) 
crackpot. I did not. When the 
matter came up again I grew dis- 
turbed. It was my intention to 
meet with Lamont, but a number of 
physicists whom I consulted — ” 
“Including Hallam?” 

“No, 1 did not talk to Hallam. 
But a number of those I consulted 
advised me that Lamont’s work 
was utterly without foundation. 
Even so, I was considering seeing 
him when I was asked to take this 
position. And here I am — and here 



you are. So you can understand 
why I wanted to meet you. In your 
opinion, is there merit in the 
theories advanced by yourself and 
Dr. Lamont?” 

“You mean is continued use of 
the Electron Pump going to blow 
up the sun, or maybe the entire 
arm of the galaxy?” 

“Yes, that’s exactly what I 
mean.” 

“How can I tell? All I have is 
my own guess, which is just a 
guess. As for Lamont’s theory, 
I have not studied it in detail — it 
has not been published. If I saw 
it, the mathematics might be 
beyond me. Besides, what’s the 
difference? Lamont won’t con- 
vince anyone. Hallam has 
ruined him as earlier he ruined me 
and the public generally would find 
it against their short-term interest 
to believe him even if he went over 
Hallam’s head, so to speak. The 
world doesn’t want to give up the 
Pump — and it’s a lot easier to re- 
fuse to accept Lamont’s theory 
than to try to do something 
about it.” 

“But you’re still concerned about 
the possibilities, aren’t you?” 

“In the sense that I think that 
we might indeed destroy ourselves 
and that I wouldn’t like to see that 
happen, of course.” 

“So you’ve come to the Moon, 
now, to do something that Hallam, 
your old enemy, would prevent 
your doing on Earth.” 

Denison said slowly, “You, too, 
like to make guesses.” 

“Do I? Perhaps I am brilliant, 
too. Is my guess correct?” 

“It may be. I haven’t given up 
hope of returning to science. If 



36 



GALAXY, 




anything I do were to lift the 
specter of doom from mankind, 
either by showing that it does not 
exist or that it does exist and must 
be eliminated, I would be pleased.” 

”1 see. Dr. Denison, to discuss 
another point at the moment - 
my predecessor, the retiring Com- 
missioner, Mr. Montez, tells me 
that the growing edge of science 
is here on the Moon. He seems to 
think a disproportionate quantity 
of the brains and initiative of 
mankind is here.” 

“He may be right,” said Deni- 
son. “I don’t know.” 

“Doesn’t it strike you that his 
being right might be inconvenient 
for your purpose? Whatever you 
do, men may say and think it was 
accomplished through the Lunar 
scientific structure. You personally 
might gain little in the way of re- 
cognition, however valuable the 
results you were to present. Which, 
of course, would be unjust.” 

“I am tired of the rat-race of 
credits. Commissioner Gottstein. 
I want some interest in life, more 
interest than I can find as Vice 
President in charge of Ultrasonic 
Depilatories. I’ll find it in a return 
to science. If I accomplish some- 
thing in my own eyes, I will be 
satisfied.” 

“Let us say that that would be 
insufficient for me. What credit 
you earn, you should receive — and 
it should be quite possible for me, 
as Commissioner, to present the 
facts to the Terrestrial community 
in such a way as to preserve for you 
what is yours. Surely you are 
human enough to want what is your 
own.” 

“You are kind. And in return?” 



“You are cynical. But justly so. 
In return I want your help. The 
retiring Commissioner, Mr. 
Montez, is not certain as to the 
lines of scientific research being 
undertaken on the Moon. Com- 
munications between the peoples 
of Earth and Moon are not per- 
fect, yet coordination of the efforts 
on both worlds would clearly bene- 
fit all. It is understandable that 
there should be distrust, I suppose, 
but anything you can do to break 
down that distrust would be as 
valuable to us as your scientific 
findings might be.” 

“Surely, Commissioner, you 
can’t feel that I’m the ideal man to 
bear witness to the Lunarites as to 
how fair-meaning and well- 
disposed the Earth’s scientific 
establishment is.” 

“You mustn’t confuse one venge- 
ful scientist with the men of Earth 
as a whole. Dr. Denison. Let’s put 
it this way. I would appreciate 
being kept aware of your scientific 
findings so that I could help you 
retain your fair share of credit. 
And in order to understand your 
findings properly — I am not a 
professional scientist myself, re- 
member — it would be helpful if 
you would explain them in the light 
of the present state of science on 
the Moon. Is it agreed?” 

Denison said, “You ask a 
hard thing. Preliminary results, 
prematurely disclosed — whether 
through carelessness or over- 
enthusiasm — can do tremendous 
harm to a reputation. I would hate 
to talk about anything to anyone 
until I am sure of my ground. My 
earlier experience with the com- 
mittee on which you served would 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



37 




certainly encourage me to preserve 
silence.” 

“I quite understand,” said 
Gottstein heartily. “I would leave 
it to you to decide when I might 
usefully be informed. Now 1 have 
kept you late and you probably 
want to sleep — ” 

Which was dismissal. Denison 
left, Gottstein looking after him 
thoughtfully. 

7 

D enison opened the door by 
hand. There was a contact 
that would have opened it auto- 
matically, but in the blur of waking 
he could not find it. 

The dark-haired man — with a 
face that was somehow scowling in 
repose — said, “I’m sorry. Am I 
early?” 

Denison repeated the last word 
to give himself time to absorb 
matters. “Early? No. I — I’m late, 
I think.” 

“I called. We made an 
appointment.” 

And now Denison had it. “Yes. 
You’re Dr. Neville.” 

“That’s right. May I come in?” 
He stepped in. Denison’s room 
was small and held a rumpled bed 
that took up most of the available 
space. The ventilator was sighing 
softly. 

Neville said with meaningless 
courtesy, “Slept well, I hope?” 
Denison looked down at his 
pajamas and passed a hand over his 
rumpled hair. “No,” he said 
abruptly. “I had an abominable 
night. May I be excused long 
enough to make myself more 
presentable?” 



“Of course. Would you like to 
have me prepare breakfast mean- 
while? You may be unacquainted 
with the equipment.” 

“It would be a favor,” said 
Denison. 

He emerged some twenty min- 
utes later, washed and shaved, 
wearing trousers and an undershirt. 

He said, “I trust 1 didn’t break 
the shower. It went off and I 
couldn’t turn it on again.” 

“The water’s rationed. You 
get only so much. This is the Moon, 
Doctor. I’ve taken the liberty of 
preparing scrambled eggs and hot 
soup for the two of us.” 

“Scrambled — ” 

“We call it, that. Earthmen 
wouldn’t, 1 suppose.” 

Denison said, “Oh?” He sat 
down with something less than 
enthusiasm and tasted the pasty 
yellow mixture. He tried not to 
make a face at the first taste and 
then manfully swallowed it and 
dug in for a second forkful. 

“You’ll get used to it with time,” 
said Neville, “and it’s highly 
nourishing. 1 might warn you that 
the high-protein content and the 
low gravity will cut your needs for 
food.” 

“Just as well,” said Denison, 
clearing his throat. 

Neville said, “Selene tells me 
that you intend to stay on the 
Moon.” 

Denison said. “That was my 
intention.” He rubbed his eyes. 
“I’ve had a terrible night, though. 
It tests my resolution.” 

“How many times did you fall 
out of bed?” 

“Twice. I take it that the prob- 
lem is a common one.” 



38 



GALAXY 




“For men of Earth, invariably. 
Awake, you can make yourself 
walk with due regard for the 
Moon’s gravity. Asleep, you toss 
as you would on Earth. But at least 
falling is not painful at low 
gravity.” 

“The second time I slept on the 
floor a while before waking. 
Didn’t remember falling. What the 
hell do you do about it?” 

“You mustn’t neglect your peri- 
odjc checks on heartbeat, blood 
pressure and so on, just to make 
sure the gravity change isn’t 
introducing too much strain.” 

“I’ve been amply warned of 
that,” said Denison with distaste. 
“In fact, I have fixed appointments 
for the next month. And pills.” 
“Well,” said Neville, as if 
dismissing a triviality, “within a 
week you’ll probably have no 
trouble at all. And you’ll need 
proper clothing. Those trousers 
will never do and that flimsy upper 
garment serves no purpose.” 

“I presume there’s some place 
I can buy clothes.” 

“Of course. If you can get her 
when she’s off duty, Selene will 
be glad to help you. I’m sure. 
She assures me you’re a decent 
sort. Doctor.” 

“I’m delighted she thinks so.” 
Denison, having swallowed a 
spoonful of the soup, looked at it 
as though wondering what to do 
with the rest. Grimly he continued 
the task of downing it. 

“She judged you to be a physi- 
cist, but of course she’s wrong.” 
“I was trained as a radiochemist.” 
“You haven’t worked at that 
either for a long time. Doctor. 
We may be out of it up here, but 



we’re not that far out of it. You’re 
one of Hallam’s victims.” 

“Are there so many you speak 
of them as a group?” 

“Why not? The whole Moon is 
one of Hallam’s victims.” 

“The Moon?” 

“In a manner of speaking.” 

“1 don’t understand.” 

“We have no Electron Pump 
stations on the Moon. None 
have been established because there 
has been no cooperation from 
the para-Universe. No samples of 
tungsten have been accepted.” 
“Surely, Dr. Neville, you don’t 
intend to imply that this is 
Hallam’s doing.” 

“In a negative way, yes. Why 
must only the para-Universe be 
able to initiate a Pump station? 
Why can’t we?” 

“As far as I know, we lack the 
knowledge to take the initiative.” 
“And we will continue to lack 
the knowledge if research into 
the matter is forbidden.” 

“Is it forbidden?” Denison 
asked with a faint note of surprise. 

“In effect. If none of the work 
necessary to expand knowledge in 
that direction finds adequate 
priorities at the proton synchrotron 
or at any of the other large 
installations — all controlled by 
Earth and all under the influence of 
Hallam — then the research is ef- 
fectively forbidden.” 

D enison yawned. “I suspect 
I will have to sleep again 
before long. I beg your pardon — 1 
did not mean to imply you were 
boring me. But tell me, is the 
Electron Pump so important to the 
Moon? Surely the solar batteries 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



39 




are effective and sufficient.” 

“They tie us to the sun, Doctor. 
They tie us to the surface.” 

“Well — But why does Hallam 
take this adverse interest in the 
matter, do you suppose. Dr. 
Neville?” 

“You know better than 1 if you 
know him personally, as I do not. 
He prefers not to make it clear to 
the public generally that the 
entire Electron Pump establish- 
ment is the product of the para- 
men, with ourselves merely 
servants of the masters. And if, 
on the Moon, we advance to the 
point where we ourselves know 
what we are doing, then the birth 
of the true Electron Pump technol- 
ogy will date from our moment, 
not from his.” 

Denison said, “Why do you tell 
me all this?” 

“To avoid wasting my time. 
Ordinarily we welcome physicists 
from Earth. We feel cut off here on 
the Moon, victims of deliberate 
Terrestrial policy against us, and a 
physicist visitor can be helpful, 
even if only to give us a feeling of 
lesser isolation. A physicist im- 
migrant is even more helpful and 
we like to explain the situation to 
him and encourage him to work 
with us. I am sorry that you are 
not, after all, a physicist.” 

Denison said impatiently, “But 
I never said I was.” 

“And yet you asked to see the 
synchrotron. Why?” 

“Is that really what’s bothering 
you. My dear sir, let me try to 
explain. My scientific career was 
ruined half a lifetime ago. I have 
decided to seek some sort of 
rehabilitation, some sort of 



renewed meaning to my life as far 
away from Hallam as I can get — 
which means here on the Moon. 
I was trained as a radiochemist, 
but that has not permanently 
paralyzed me as far as any other 
field of endeavor is concerned. 
Para-physics is the great field of 
today and I have done my best to 
self-educate myself there, feeling 
that this will offer me my best hope 
for rehabilitation.” 

Neville nodded dubiously. 

“By the way, since you men- 
tioned the Electron Pump — Have 
you heard anything about the 
theories of Peter Lamont?” 

Neville eyed the other narrowly. 
“No. I don’t think I know the 
man.” 

“He is not yet famous. And 
probably never will be — chiefly 
for the same reason I’ll never be. 
He crossed Hallam. His name 
came up recently and I’ve been 
giving him some thought. It was 
one way of occupying the sleepless 
portion of last night.” He yawned 
again. 

Neville said impatintly, “Yes, 
Doctor? What of this man?” 

“He has some interesting 
thoughts on para-theory. He 
believes that with continued use of 
the Pump, the strong nuclear 
interaction will grow basically 
more intense in the solar system — 
causing the sun to slowly heat 
up and, at some crucial point, 
undergo a phase change that will 
produce an explosion.” 

“Nonsense. Do you know the 
amount of change produced on a 
cosmic scale by any use of the 
Pump on a human scale? Even 
granted that you are only self- 



40 



GALAXY 




educated in physics, you should 
have no difficulty in seeing that 
the Pump can’t possibly make 
any appreciable change in Uni- 
verse conditions during the life- 
time of the solar system.” 

“Do you think that?” 

“Of course. Don’t you?” 

“I’m not sure. Lament’s grinding 
a personal axe. I’ve met him 
briefly and he impressed me as an 
intense and very emotional 
fellow. Considering what Hallam 
has done to him, he is probably 
driven by overwhelming anger.” 
Neville frowned. “Are you sure 
he is on the outs with Hallam?” 
“I’m an expert on the subject.” 
“It doesn’t occur to you that the 
initiation of that kind of doubt— 
that the Pump is dangerous — 
might be used as merely another 
device to keep the Moon from 
developing Pumps of its own?” 

“At the cost of creating universal 
alarm and despondency? Of 
course not. That would be cracking 
walnuts with nuclear explosions. 
No, I’m sure Lamont is sincere. 
In fact, in my own bumbling way 
I had similar notions once.” 
“Because you, too, are driven 
by hate for Hallam.” 

“I’m not Lamont. I imagine I 
don’t react the same way he does. 
In fact, 1 had some dim hope 1 
would be able to investigate the 
matter on the Moon, without 
Hallam’s interference and without 
Lamont’s emotionalism.” 

“Here on the Moon?” 

“Here on the Moon. I thought 
perhaps 1 might get the use of the 
synchrotron.” 

“And that was your interest in 
it?” 



Denison nodded. 

Neville said, “You really think 
you will get the use of the 
synchrotron? Do you know how far 
back the priorities have piled up?” 
“I thought perhaps I might get 
the cooperation of some of the 
Lunar scientists.” 

Neville laughed and shook his 
head. “We have almost as little 
chance at the synchrotron as you. 
However, I’ll tell you what we can 
do. We have established labora- 
tories of our own. We can give you 
space- -we might even have some 
minor instrumentation for you. 
How useful our facilities would 
be to you I can’t say, but you might 
be able to do something.” 

“Do you suppose you would 
have any means of making observa- 
tions useful to para-theory?” 

“It would depend partly on your 
ingenuity, I guess. Do you expect 
to prove the theories of this man, 
Lamont?” 

“Or disprove them. Perhaps.” 
“You’ll disprove them, if any- 
thing I have no fears about that.” 
Denison said, “It’s quite clear, 
isn’t it, that I’m not a physicist 
by training? Why do you so readily 
offer me working space?” 

“Because you’re from Earth. I 
told you we value that — and per- 
haps your self-education as a 
physicist will be of additional value. 
Selene vouches for you, something 
I attach more importance to than 
I should, perhaps. And we are 
fellow-sufferers at the hands of 
Hallam. If you wish to rehabilitate 
yourself, we will help you.” 

“But pardon me if I am cynical. 
What do you expect to get out of 
it?” 



THE GODS THEMSELVES

“Your help. There is a certain 
amount of misunderstanding 
between the scientists of the Earth 
and the Moon. You are a man of 
Earth who has come voluntarily 
to the Moon and you could act as 
a bridge between us to the benefit 
of both. You have already had 
contact with the new Commissioner 
and it may be possible that, as you 
rehabilitate yourself, you will 
rehabilitate us as well.” 

“You mean that if what I do 
weakens Hallam’s influence. 
Lunar science will benefit?” 
“Whatever you accomplish is 
sure to be useful. But perhaps I 
ought to leave you to catch up with 
your sleep. Call on me during the 
next couple of days and I will see 
about placing you in a laboratory. 
And—” he looked about, “getting 
you somewhat more comfortable 
quarters.” 

They shook hands and Neville left.

G OTTSTEIN said, “I suppose 
that, however annoying this 
position may have become for you, 
you are leaving it today with a 
small pang.” 

Montez shrugged eloquently. 
“A very large pang, when I think 
of the return to full gravity. The 
difficulty of breathing — the aching 
feet — the perspiration. I’ll be in a 
bath of perspiration constantly.” 
“It will be my turn some day.” 
“Take my advice. Never stay 
here longer than two months at a 
time. I don’t care what the doctors 
tell you or what kind of isometric 
exercises they put you through — 
get back to Earth every sixty days 



and stay at least a week. You’ve 
got to keep the feel of it.” 

“I’ll bear that in mind. Oh, I’ve 
been in touch with my friend.” 
“Which friend is that?” 

“The man who was on the vessel 
with me when I came in. I thought 
1 remembered him and 1 did. He’s 
Denison — a radiochemist. What 
1 recalled about him was accurate 
enough.” 

“Ah?” 

“What 1 actually remembered 
was a certain interesting irration- 
ality of his and I tried to probe it. 
He resisted in quite shrewd 
fashion. He sounded rational — 
so rational, in fact, that I grew 
suspicious. His is a kind of at- 
tractive rationality developed by 
certain types of crackpots as a 
defense mechanism.” 

“Oh, Lord,” said Montez, clearly 
harassed. “I’m not sure I follow 
you. I’m going to sit down for a 
moment. Between trying to deter- 
mine whether everything is properly 
packed and thinking about Earth’s 
gravity — I’m out of breath. What 
kind of irrationality masquerades 
as rationality?” 

“He tried to tell us once that 
there was danger in the use of the 
Electron Pumps. He thought the 
process would blow up the 
Universe.” 

“Indeed? And will it?” 

“I Tiope not. At the time his 
ideas were dismissed rather brus- 
quely. When scientists work on a 
subject at the limit of understand- 
ing they grow edgy, you know. I 
knew a psychiatrist once who 
called it the ‘Who knows?’ 
phenomenon. If nothing you do will 
give you the knowledge you need. 



42 



GALAXY 




you end by saying, 'Who knows 
what will happen?’ and imagination 
tells you.” 

“Yes, but if physicists go around 
saying such things, even a few of 
them — ” 

“But they don’t. Not officially. 
There’s such a thing as scientific 
responsibility and the journals 
are careful not to print nonsense. 
Or what they consider nonsense. 
Actually, you know, the subject’s 
come up again. A physicist named 
Lamont spoke to Senator Burt, 
also to that self-appointed environ- 
mental messiah, Chen, and a few 
others. He also insi.sts on the pos- 
sibility of cosmic explosion. No 
one believes him but the story 
spreads in a thin sort of way and 
gets better with the retelling.” 
“And this man here on the 
Moon believes it.” 

Gottstein smiled broadly. “1 
suspect he does. Hell, in the 
middle of the night when I have 
trouble sleeping — I keep falling 
out of bed, by the way — 1 believe 
it myself. He probably hopes to 
test the theory experimentally — 
here.” 

“Well?” 

“Well, let him. 1 hinted we 
would help him.” 

Montez shook his head. “That’s 
risky. I don’t like official en- 
couragement of crackpot notions.” 
“It’s just barely possible they 
may not be entirely crackpot, but 
that’s not the point. The point is 
that if we can get him established 
here on the Moon we may find out, 
through him, what’s going on 
here. He’s anxious for rehabilita- 
tion and I hinted that rehabilitation 
would come through us if he co- 



operated. I’ll see to it that you 
are discreetly kept posted. As 
between friends, you know.” 
“Thank you,” said Montez. 
“And goodbye.” 

9 

N eville chafed. “No. i 
don’t like him.” 

“Why not? Because he’s an 
Earthie?” Selene brushed a bit of 
fluff from her right breast, caught 
it and studied it critically. “That’s 
not from my blouse. I tell you the 
air recirculation is abominable.” 
“This Denison is worthless. 
He is not a para-physicist. He’s a 
self-educated man in the field, he 
says, and proves it by coming 
here with ready-made, damn-fool 
notions.” 

“Like what?” 

“He thinks the Electron Pump 
is going to explode the Universe.” 
“Did he say that?” 

“I know he thinks that. Oh, I’m 
aware of the arguments. I’ve heard 
them often enough. But it’s not so, 
that’s all.” 

“Maybe,” said Selene, raising 
her eyebrows, “you just don’t 
want it to be so.” 

“Don’t you start.” 

There was a short pause. Selene 
said, “Well, what will you do 
with him?” 

“I’ll give him a place to work. 
He may be worthless as a scientist, 
but he’ll have his uses just the 
same. He’ll be conspicuous 
enough — the Commissioner has 
already been talking to him.” 

“I know.” 

“Well, he has a romantic history 
— a man with a wrecked career 



the gods THEMSELVES 



43 




trying to rehabilitate himself.” 

“Really?” 

“Really. I’m sure you’ll love it. 
Ask him to tell you. It’s a point in 
his favor. A romantic Earthman 
working on the Moon on a crack- 
pot project will .make a perfect 
object to preoccupy the Commis- 
sioner. And through Denison — who 
knows? — we might just possibly 
get a better idea of what’s really 
happening on Earth. You’d better 
continue to be friendly with him, 
Selene.” 

10 

ELENE laughed. The sound 
was metallic in Denison’s ear- 
piece. Her figure was lost in the 
spacesuit she wore. 

She said, “Come on, Ben, there’s 
no reason to be afraid. You’re an 
old hand by now — you’ve been 
here a month.” 

“Twenty-eight days,” mumbled 
Denison. He felt smothered in his 
suit. 

“A month,” insisted Selene. 
“It was well past half-Earth when 
you came and it’s well past half- 
Earth now.” She pointed to the 
brilliant curve of the Earth in the 
southern sky. 

“Wait. I’m not as brave out 
here as 1 am underground. What 
if I fall?” 

“What if you do? The gravity is 
weak by your standards. The slope 
is gentle and your suit is strong. 
If you fall, just let yourself slide 
and roll. It’s almost as much fun 
that way.” 

Denison looked about doubt- 
fully. The Moon lay beautiful in 
the cold light of the Earth. The 



surface was black and white a 
delicate white compared with the 
sunlit views he had seen when he 
had taken a trip a week before to 
inspect the solar batteries that 
stretched from horizon to horizon 
along the floor of Mare Imbrium. 
And the black was somehow softer, 
too, through lack of the blazing 
contrast of true day. The stars 
were supernally bright and the 
Earth — the Earth — was infinitely 
inviting with its swirls of white on 
blue and its peeping glimpse of 
tan. 

He asked, “Do you mind if I 
hang on to you?” 

“Of course not. And we won’t 
go all the way up. It will be the 
beginner’s slope for you. Just try 
to keep in time with me. I’ll move 
slowly.” 

Her steps were long, slow and 
swinging. He tried to keep his 
in synch. The up slope was dusty 
— with each step he kicked up a 
fine powder that settled quickly 
in the airlessness. He matched her 
stride for stride, but with an effort. 

“Good,” said Selene, her arm 
locked in his, steadying him. 
“You’re very good for an Earthie 
— no, I ought to say Immie — ” 

“Thank you.” 

“That’s not much better, 1 sup- 
pose. Immie for immigrant is as 
insulting as Earthie for Earthman. 
Shall I just say you’re simply 
very good for a man your age?” 

“No — that’s much worse.” 
Denison was gasping a little 
and he could feel his forehead 
moistening. 

Selene said, “Each time you 
reach the point where you’re about 
to put your foot down, give a little 




44 



GALAXY 




push with your other foot. That will 
lengthen your stride and make it 
all the easier. Watch me.” 

Denison paused thankfully and 
watched Selene, slim and graceful 
despite the grotesquerie of the suit, 
take off in low, loping leaps. She 
returned and kneeled at his feet. 

“Now you take a slow step, Ben, 
and I’ll hit your foot when I want 
it to shove.” 

They tried several times. Finally 
Denison said, “That’s worse than 
running on Earth. I’d better rest.” 

“It’s just that your muscles aren’t 
used to the proper coordination. 
You’re fighting yourself, not 
gravity. Well, sit down and catch 
your breath. I won’t take you up 
much farther.” 

Denison said, “Will I do any 
damage to the pack if I lie down 
on my back?” 

“No, but it’s not a good idea. 
Not on the bare ground. It’s at a 
hundred and twenty degrees ab- 
solute — hundred and fifty below 
zero, if you prefer — and the 
smaller the area of contact the 
better. I’d sit down.” 

“All right.” Denison sat with a 
grunt. Deliberately he faced away 
from the Earth. “Look at those 
stars!” 

Selene sat facing him at right 
angles. He could see her face 
dimly through the faceplate when 
the Earthlight caught it at the 
proper angle. 

She said, “Don’t you see the 
stars on Earth?” 

“Not like this. The air on Earth 
absorbs some of the light even 
when there are no clouds. Tempera- 
ture differences in the atmosphere 
make them twinkle and city lights. 



even distant city lights, wash them 
out.” 

“Sounds disgusting.” 

“Do you like it out here, Selene? 
On the surface?” 

“I’m not really crazy about it, 
but I don’t mind it too much now 
and then. It’s part of my job to 
bring tourists out here, of course.” 
“And now you have to do it for 
me.” 

“Can’t I convince you it’s not 
the same thing at all, Ben? We’ve 
got a set route for the tourists. 
It’s very tame, very uninteresting. 
You don’t think we’d take them out 
here to the slide, do you? This is 
for Lunarites — and Immies. Mostly 
Immies, actually.” 

“It can’t be very popular. No 
one’s here but us.” 

“Oh, well. There are particular 
days for this sort of thing. You 
should see this place on race days. 
You wouldn’t like it then, though.” 
“I’m not sure I like it now. Is 
gliding a sport for Immies?” 
“Rather. Lunarites generally 
don't like the surface.” 

“How about Dr. Neville?” 

“You mean, how does he feel 
about the surface?” 

“Yes.” 

“I don’t think he’s ever been up 
here. He’s a real city boy. Why 
do you ask?” 

“Well, when I asked permission 
to go along on the routine servicing 
of the solar batteries he was per- 
fectly willing to have me go, but 
he wouldn’t go himself. 1 asked 
him to come so 1 would have some- 
one to answer my questions. His 
refusal was rather strong.” 

“I hope you found someone else 
to answer your questions.” 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



45 




“Oh, yes. He was an Immie, 
come to think of it. Maybe that 
explains Dr. Neville’s attitude 
toward the Electron Pump.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Well — ” Denison leaned back 
and kicked up his legs alternately, 
watching them rise and fall slowly 
with a certain lazy pleasure. “Hey, 
that’s not bad. Look, Selene — 
What I mean is that Neville is 
intent on developing a Pump Sta- 
tion on the Moon although the 
solar batteries are quite adequate 
for the job. We couldn’t use solar 
batteries on the Earth, where the 
sun is not as unfailing, as constant, 
as bright, as radiant in all wave- 
lengths. There’s not a single plane- 
tary body in the solar system, no 
body of any size, that is more suit- 
able for the use of the batteries than 
the Moon is. Even Mercury is too 
hot. But the use does tie you to the 
surface, and if you don’t like the 
surface — ” 

S ELENE rose to her feet sud- 
denly and said, “All right, 
Ben, you’ve rested enough. Up! 
Up!” 

He struggled to his feet and said, 
“A Pump on the Moon, however, 
would mean that no Lunarite 
would ever have to come out on the 
surface if he didn’t want to.” 
“Uphill we go, Ben. We’ll go to 
that ridge ahead. See it, where 
the Earthlight cuts off in a horizon- 
tal line?” 

They made their way up the final 
stretch silently. Denison was aware 
of the smoother area to one side 
of his path — a wide swath of slope 
from which most of the dust had 
been brushed. 



“That’s too smooth for a begin- 
ner to work up,” Selene said, an- 
swering his thoughts. “Don’t get 
too ambitious or you’ll want me to 
teach you the kangaroo-hop next.” 

She made a kangaroo-hop as she 
spoke, turned about-face almost 
before landing and said, “Right 
here. Sit down and Pll adjust — ” 

Denison did, facing downhill. 
He looked down the slope uncer- 
tainly. “Can you really glide on 
it?” 

“Of course. The gravity is so 
much weaker on the Moon than 
on the Earth that you press 
against the ground much less 
strongly. That means there is much 
less friction. Everything is more 
slippery on the Moon than on the 
Earth. That’s why the floors in 
our corridors and apartments 
seemed unfinished to you. Would 
you like to hear me give my little 
lecture on the subject? The one 
I give the tourists?” 

“No, Selene.” 

“Besides, we’re going to use 
gliders, of course.” She had a 
small cartridge in her hand. Clamps 
and a pair of thin tubes were at- 
tached to it. 

“What is that?” asked Ben. 

“Just a small liquid-gas reser- 
voir. It will emit a jet of vapor 
just under your boots. The thin 
gas layer between boots and 
ground will reduce friction virtu- 
ally to zero. You’ll move as though 
you were in clear space.” 

Denison said uneasily, “I dis- 
approve. Surely it’s wasteful to 
use gas in this fashion on the 
Moon.” 

“Oh? What gas do you think 
we use in these gliders? Carbon 



46 



GALAXY 




dioxide? Oxygen? This is waste 
gas to begin with. It’s argon. It 
comes out of the Moon’s soil in 
ton lots, formed by the billions of 
years of breakdown of pofassium- 
40. That’s part of my lecture, too, 
Ben. The argon has only a few spe- 
cialized uses on the Moon. We 
could use it for gliding for a mil- 
lion years without exhausting the 
supply. All right. Your gliders 
are on. Now wait till I put on 
mine.” 

“How do they work?” 

“It’s quite automatic. You just 
start sliding and that will trip the 
contact and start the vapor. You’ve 
got only a few minutes’ supply but 
that’s all you’ll need.” 

She stood up and helped him to 
his feet. “Face downhill. Come 
on, Ben, this is a gentle slope. Look 
at it. It looks nearly level.” 

“No, it doesn’t,” said Denison 
sulkily. “It looks like a cliff to me.” 
“Nonsense. Now listen to me 
and remember what I told you. 
Keep your feet about six inches 
apart and one just a few inches 
ahead of the other. It doesn’t mat- 
ter which one is ahead. Keep your 
knees bent. Don’t lean into the 
wind because there isn’t any. Don’t 
try to look up or back, but you can 
look from side to side if you have 
to. Most of all, when you finally 
hit level don’t try to stop too soon 
—you’ll be going faster than you 
think. Just let the glider expire 
and then friction will bring you to 
a slow halt.” 

“I’ll never remember all that.” 
“Yes, you will. And I’ll be right 
at your side to help. And if you do 
fall and I don’t catch you — don’t 
try to do anything. Just relax and 



let yourself tumble or slide. There 
are no boulders anywhere that you 
can collide with.” 

D enison swallowed and 
looked ahead. The slide was 
gleaming in Earthlight. Minute 
unevennesses caught more than 
their share of light, leaving tiny 
uphill patches in darkness so that 
there was a vague mottling of the 
surface. The bulging half-circle 
of Earth rode the black sky almost 
directly ahead. 

“Ready?” Selene’s gauntleted 
hand was between his shoulders. 
“Ready,” said Denison faintly. 
“Then off you go,” she said. 
She pushed and Denison felt him- 
self begin to move. He moved quite 
slowly at first. He turned toward 
her, wobbling, and she said, “Don’t 
worry. I’m right at your side.” 
He could feel the ground beneath 
his feet — and then he could not. 
The glider had been activated. 

For a moment he felt as though 
he were standing still. There was 
no push of air against his body, no 
feel of anything sliding past his 
feet. But when he turned toward 
Selene again, he noticed that the 
lights and shadows to one side were 
moving backward at a slowly in- 
creasing speed. 

“Keep your eyes on the Earth,” 
Selene’s voice said in his ear, “Till 
you build up speed. The faster you 
go the more stable you’ll be. Keep 
your knees bent. You’re doing 
very well, Ben.” 

“For an Immie,” gasped Denison. 
“How does it feel?” 

“Like flying,” he said. The pat- 
tern of light and dark on either 
side was moving backward in a 



the gods THEMSELVES 



47 




blur. He looked briefly to one side, 
then the other, trying to convert 
the sensation of a backward flight 
of his surroundings into one of a 
forward flight of his own. As soon 
as he succeeded he found he had 
to look forward at the Earth hast- 
ily to regain his sense of balance. 
“I suppose that’s not a good com- 
parison to use with you. You have 
no experience of flying on the 
Moon.” 

“Now 1 know, though. Flying 
must be like gliding — I know 
what that is.” 

She was keeping up with him 
easily. 

Denison was now going fast 
enough for him to get a sensation 
of motion even when he looked 
forward. The Moonscape ahead 
was opening before him and flow- 
ing past on either side. He said, 
“How fast do you get to go in a 
glide?” 

“A good race,” said Selene, 
“has been clocked at speeds in 
excess of a hundred miles an hour — 
on steeper slopes than this one, 
of course. You’ll probably reach 
a top of thirty-five.” 

“It feels a lot faster than that.” 

“Well, it isn’t. We’re leveling 
off now, Ben, and you haven’t 
fallen. Just hang on — the glider 
will die out and you’ll feel friction. 
Don’t do anything to help it. Just 
keep going.” 

Selene had barely completed her 
remarks when Denison felt the 
beginning of pressure under his 
boots. There was at once an over- 
whelming sensation of speed and 
he clenched his fists hard to keep 
from throwing his arms up in an 
almost reflex gesture against the 



collision that was not going to 
happen. He knew that if he threw 
up his arms, he would go over 
backward. 

He narrowed his eyes, held his 
breath till he thought his lungs 
would explode, and then Selene 
said, “Perfect, Ben, perfect. I’ve 
never known an Immie to go 
through his first slide without a 
fall — so if you do fall, there’ll be 
nothing wrong. No disgrace.” 

“I don’t intend to fall,” whis- 
pered Denison. He caught a large, 
ragged breath and dpened his eyes 
wide. The Earth was as serene as 
ever, as uncaring. He was moving 
more slowly now — more slowly — 
more slowly . 

“Am I standing still now, 
Selene?” he asked. “I’m not sure.” 
“You’re standing still. Don’t 
move. You’ve got to rest before we 
make the trip back to town. Damn 
it, I left it somewhere around here 
when we came up.” 

D enison watched her in 
disbelief She had climbed 
up with him, had glided down with 
him. Yet he was half-dead with 
weariness and tension and she was 
in the air with long kangaroo-leaps. 
She seemed a hundred yards away 
when she said, “Here it is — ” and 
her voice was as loud in his ears 
as when she had stood next to him. 

She was back in a moment with 
a folded sheet of plastic under 
her arm. 

“Remember,” she said cheerily, 
“when you asked what it was on 
our way up and I said we’d be 
using it before we came down?” 
She unfolded it and spread it on 
the dusty surface of the Moon. “A 



48 



GALAXY 




Lunar Lounge is its full name, but 
we just call it a lounge. We take 
the adjective for granted on this 
world.” She inserted a cartridge 
and tripped a lever. 

It began to fill. Denison had 
expected a hissing noise, but of 
course there was no air. 

“Before you question our con- 
servation policies again,” said 
Selene, “this also is argon.” 

The plastic blossomed into a 
mattress on six stubby legs. “It 
will hold you,” she said. “It makes 
very little actual contact with the 
ground and the vacuum all around 
will conserve its heat.” 

“Don’t tell me it’s hot — ” 

“The argon is heated as it pours 
in, but only relatively. It ends up 
at two hundred seventy degrees 
absolute, almost warm enough 
to melt ice and quite warm enough 
to keep your insulated suit from 
losing heat faster than you can 
manufacture it. Go ahead. Lie 
down.” 

Denison did so with a sensation 
of enormous luxury. 

“Great,” he said, sighing. 

“Mama Selene thinks of every- 
thing,” she said. 

She came from behind him now, 
gliding around him, her feet placed 
heel to heel as though she were on 
skates. She let the feet fly out from 
under her as she came down grace- 
fully on hip and elbow on the 
ground just beside him. 

Denison whistled. “How did you 
do that?” 

“Lots of practice. And don’t you 
try it. You’ll break your elbow. I 
warn you, though. If I get too cold 
I’m going to have to crowd you on 
the lounge.” 



“Safe enough,” he said, “with 
both of us in suits.” 

“Ah, there speaks my brave 
lecher. How do you feel?” 

“All right, 1 guess. What an 
experience!” 

“What an experience? You set 
a record for non-falls. Do you mind 
if I tell the folks back in town 
about this?” 

“No. Always like to be appre- 
ciated. You’re not going to expect 
me to do this again, are you?” 
“Right now? Of course not. I 
wouldn’t myself. We’ll just rest a 
while — make sure your heart action 
is back to normal — and then we’ll 
go back. If you’ll reach your legs, 
in my directon. I’ll take your 
gliders off. Next time I’ll show 
you how to handle the gliders 
yourself.” 

“I’m not sure there will be a next 
time.” 

“Of course there will. Didn’t 
you enjoy it?” 

“A little. Between terrors.” 
“You’ll know fewer terrors 
next time and still less the time 
after. Eventually you’ll experience 
just the enjoyment and I’ll make a 
racer out of you.” 

“No, you won’t. I’m too old.” 
“Not on the Moon. You just 
look old.” 

D enison could feel the ulti- 
mate quiet of the Moon 
soaking into him as he lay there. 
He once more faced the Earth. 
Its steady presence in the sky had, 
more than anything else, given him 
the sensation of stability during 
his recent glide and he felt grateful 
to it. 

“Do you often come out here. 



THE GODS THEMSELVES

Selene? I mean, by yourself or 
with just one or two others? You 
know, when it isn’t fiesta time?” 
“Practically never. This is too 
much for me unless there are 
people around. That I’m doing it 
now actually surprises me.” 
“Uh-huh,” said Denison, non- 
committally. 

“You’re not surprised?” 

“Should I be? My feeling is that 
each person does what he does 
either because he wants to or he 
must--and in either case that’s 
his business, not mine.” 

“Thanks, Ben. I mean it — it’s 
good to hear. One of the nice 
things about you, Ben, is that for 
an Itnmie you’re excellent at 
accepting us as we are. We’re 
underground people, we Lunarites 
— cave people, corridor people. 
And what’s wrong with that?” 
“Nothing.” 

^ “Not to hear the Earthies talk. 
I’m a tourist guide and have to 
listen to them. There isn’t anything 
they say that I haven’t heard a mil- 
lion tirties, but what 1 hear most of 
all is--” she dropped into the 
clipped accents of the typical 
Earthie speaking Planetary Stan- 
dard — “ ‘But, dear, how can all 
you people live in caves all the 
time? Doesn’t it give you a terrible 
closed-in feeling? Don’t you ever 
want to see blue sky and trees and 
ocean and feel wind and smell 
flowers?’ I could go on and on, 
Ben. Then they say, ‘But I suppose 
you don’t know what blue sky 
and sea and trees are like, so you 
don’t rniss them.’ As if we didn’t 
receive Earth television and didn’t 
have full access to Earth literature, 
both optical and auditory — and 



olfactory sometimes, too.” 

Denison was amused. He said, 
“What’s the official answer to 
remarks like that?” 

“Nothing much. We just say, 
‘We’re quite used to it, madam.’ 
Or ‘sir’ if it’s a man. Usually it’s 
a woman. The men are too inter- 
ested in studying our blouses and 
wondering when we take them off. 
You know what I’d like to tell the 
idiots?” 

“Please tell me. As long as you 
have to keep the blouse on, it 
being inside the suit, at least get 
that off your chest.” 

“Funny, funny! I’d like to tell 
them, ‘Look, madam, why the hell 
should we be interested in your 
damned world? We don’t want to 
be hanging on the outside of any 
planet, waiting to fall off or get 
blown off. We don’t want raw air 
puffing at us and dirty water fall- 
ing on us. We don’t want your dam- 
ned germs and your smelly grass 
and your dull blue sky and your 
dull white clouds. We can see 
Earth in our own sky when we want 
to and we don’t often want to. The 
Moon is our home and it’s what 
we make it — exactly what we make 
it. We own it and we build our own 
ecology and we don’t need you here 
being sorry for us for going our 
own way. Go back to your own 
world and let your gravity pull 
your breast down to your knees.’ 
That’s what I’d say.” 

Denison said, “All right. When- 
ever you get too close to saying 
that to some Earthie, you come 
say it to me and you’ll feel better.” 
“You know what? Every once in 
a while some Immie suggests that 
we build an Earth park on the 



50 



GALAXY 




Moon — some little spot featuring 
Earth plants brought in as seeds 
or seedlings. Maybe stocked with 
some animals. A touch of home - 
that’s the usual expression.” 

“I take it you’re against that.” 
“Of course I’m against it. A 
touch of whose home? The Moon is 
our home. An Immie who wants 
a touch of home had better get 
back to his home. Immies can be 
worse than Earthies sometimes.” 
“I’ll keep that in mind,” said 
Denison. 

“Not you— so far,” said Selene. 

T he silence lasted a moment 
and Denison wondered if 
Selene were going to suggest a 
return to the caverns. It wouldn’t 
be long before he would feel a 
fairly strenuous craving to visit 
a rest room. At the same time, 
he had never felt as relaxed as he 
felt out here. He wondered how 
long the oxygen in his pack would 
hold out. 

“Ben, do you mind if I ask you 
a question?” 

“Not at all. If it’s my private 
life that interests you, I am without 
secrets. I’m five-foot-nine, weigh 
twenty-eight pounds on the Moon, 
had one wife long ago, now di- 
vorced, one child, a daughter, 
grown up and married. I attended 
the University of — ” 

“No, Ben. I’m serious. May I 
ask about your work?” 

“Of course you may, Selene. 1 
don’t know how much I can ex- 
plain to you, though.” 

“Well — you know that Barron 
and I—” 

“Yes, I know,” said Denison 
brusquely. 



“We talk together. He sometimes 
tells me things. He said you think 
the Electron Pump might make 
the Universe explode.” 

“Our section of the Universe. It 
might convert a part of our galac- 
tic arm into a quasar.” 

“Really? Doyou really think so?” 
Denison said, “When I came to 
the Moon 1 wasn’t sure. Now 1 am. 
I am personally convinced that 
this will happen.” 

“When do you think it will 
happen?” 

“That I can’t say exactly. May- 
be a few years from now. Maybe 
a few decades.” 

After a brief hesitation Selene 
said in a subdued voice, “Barron 
doesn’t think so.” 

“I know he doesn’t. I’m not 
trying to convert him. You don’t 
beat refusal to believe by a frontal 
attack. That’s Lament’s mistake.” 
“Who’s Lament?” 

“I’m sorry, Selene. I’m talking 
to myself.” 

“No, Ben. Please tell me. I’m 
interested. Please.” 

Denison turned to lie on his side, 
facing her. “All right,” he said. 
“I have no objection to telling you. 
Lament, a physicist back on Earth, 
tried in his way to alert the world 
to the dangers of the Pump. He 
failed. Earthmen want the Pump. 
They want free energy and want 
it enough to refuse to believe 
they can’t have it.” 

“But why should they want it 
if it means death?” 

“All they have to do is refuse to 
believe it means death. The easiest 
way to handle a problem is to deny 
it exists. Your friend. Dr. Neville, 
does the same thing. He dislikes 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



51 




the surface, so he forces himself to 
believe that solar batteries are no 
good — even though to any impar- 
tial observer they would seem the 
perfect energy source for the Moon. 
He wants the Pump so he can stay 
underground— consequently he re- 
fuses to believe there can be any 
danger from it.” 

Selene said, “I don’t think Bar- 
ron would refuse to believe some- 
thing for which valid evidence 
existed. Do you really have the 
evidence?” 

“I think I do. It’s most amazing 
really, Selene. The whole thing 
depends on certain subtle factors 
of quark-quark interactions. Do 
you know what that means?” 

“You don’t have to explain. I’ve 
talked so much to Barron about 
all sorts of things that I might be 
able to follow.” 

“Well, I thought I would need 
the Lunar proton synchrotron for 
the purpose. It’s twenty-five miles 
across, has superconducting mag- 
nets and can dispose of energies of 
twenty thousand Bev and more. 
It turns out, though, that you 
people have something you call a 
Pionizer. It fits into a moderately 
sized room and does all the work 
of the synchrotron. The Moon is 
to be congratulated on a most 
amazing advance.” 

“Thank you,” said Selene com- 
placently. “1 mean, on behalf of 
the Moon.” 

“Well, then, my Pionizer results 
can show the rate of increase of 
intensity of strong nuclear inter- 
action — and the increase is what 
Lamont says it is and not what 
the orthodox theory would have 
it be.” 



“And have you shown your re- 
sults to Barron?” 

“Not yet. I expect him to reject 
them. He’ll say the results are 
marginal. He’ll say I’ve made an 
error. He’ll say that 1 haven’t 
taken all factors into account. 
He’ll say I’ve used inadequate 
controls. What he really will be 
saying is this: he wants the Electron 
Pump and won’t give it up.” 

“You mean there’s no way out?” 
“Of course there is, but not the 
direct way. Not Lamont’s way.” 
“What’s your idea?” 

“Lamont’s solution is to force 
abandonment of the Pump, but 
you can’t Just move backward. You 
can’t push the chicken back into 
the egg, the wine back into the 
grape, the boy back into the womb. 
If you want the baby to let go of 
your watch, you don’t just try to 
explain that he ought to do it — 
you offer him something he would 
rather have.” 

“And what would that be in this 
case?” 

“Ah, that’s where I’m not so 
sure. I do have an idea, a simple 
idea — perhaps too simple to work 
— based on the quite obvious fact 
that the number two is ridiculous 
and can’t exist.” 

Selene took a moment for 
thought and then, her voice as 
absorbed as his, said, “Let me 
guess your meaning. It could make 
sense to suppose that our own 
Universe is the only one that can 
exist or does exist, because it is 
the only one we live in and directly 
experience. Once, however, evi- 
dence arises that there is a second 
Universe as well — the one we call 
the para-Universe — then it be- 



52 



GALAXY 




conies absolutely ridiculous to 
suppose that there are two and 
only two Universes. If a second 
Universe can exist, then an infi- 
nite number can. Between one and 
the infinite - in cases such as this 
there are no sensible numbers. 
Not only two, but any finite num- 
ber is ridiculous and can’t exist.” 
Denison said, “That is exactly 
my reas ” He heaved himself to 
a sitting position and looked down 
at the suit-encased girl. He said, 
“I think we had better go back to 
town.” 

She said, “I was just guessing.” 
He said, “No, you weren’t. 
Whatever it was, it wasn’t just 
guessing.” 

11 

ARRON NEVILLE stared 
at her, quite speechless. She 
looked calmly back at him. Her 
window panoramas had been 
changed again. One now showed 
the Earth a little more than half 
full. 

Finally he asked, “Why?” 

She said, “It was an accident, 
really. I saw the point and I was 
too enthusiastic not to speak. I 
should have told you days ago but 
I was afraid your reaction would be 
exactly what it is.” 

“So he knows. You fool!” 

She frowned. “What does he 
know? Only what he would have 
guessed sooner or later — that I’m 
not really a tourist guide — that 
I’m your Intuitionist. An Intu- 
itionist who knows no mathe- 
matics, for heaven’s sake. So what 
if he knows that? What does it 
matter if I have intuition? How 



many times have you told me that 
my intuition has no value till it is 
backed by mathematical rigor and 
experimental observation? How 
many times have you told me that 
the most compelling intuition could 
be wrong? Well, then, what value 
will he place on mere Intuitionism?” 
Neville grew white, but Selene 
could not tell whether from anger 
or apprehension. He said, “You’re 
different. Hasn’t your intuition 
always proved right? When you 
were sure of it?” 

“Ah, but he doesn’t know that, 
does he?” 

“He’ll guess it. He’ll see 
Gottstein.” 

“What will he tell Gottstein? 
He still has no idea of what we’re 
really after.” 

“Doesn’t he?” 

“No.” She stood up, walked 
away. She turned back to him and 
shouted, “No! It’s cheap of you 
to imply that I would betray you 
and the rest. If you don’t accept 
my integrity, then accept my com- 
mon sense.There’s no point in my 
telling Denison what you’re up to. 
What’s the use of our secret to 
him — or to us — if we’re all going 
to be destroyed?” 

“Oh, please, Selene!” Neville 
waved his hand in disgust. “Not 
that.” 

“No. You listen. He talked to 
me arid described his work. You 
hide me like a secret weapon. You 
tell me that I’m more valuable 
than any instrument or any ordi- 
nary scientist. You play your 
games of conspiracy, insisting that 
everyone must continue to think 
me a tourist guide and nothing 
more, so that my great talents 




THE GODS THEMSELVES 



53 




will always be available to the 
Lunarites. To you especially. And 
what do you accomplish?” 

“We have you, haven’t we? How 
long do you suppose you would 
have remained free if they — ” 
“You keep saying things like 
that. But who’s been imprisoned? 
Who’s been stopped? Where is the 
evidence of the great conspiracy 
you see all around you? The Earth- 
men keep you and your team from 
their large instruments much more 
because you goad them into doing 
so than out of any malice on their 
part. And that’s done us good 
rather than harm, since it’s forced 
us to invent other instruments 
that are more subtle.” 

“Based on your theoretical in- 
sights, Selene.” 

Selene smiled, “I know. Ben was 
very complimentary about them.” 
“You and your Ben. What the 
hell do you want with that miser- 
able Earthie?” 

“He’s an immigrant. And what 
1 want is information. Do you 
give me any? You’re so damned 
afraid I’ll be caught that you don’t 
dare let me be seen talking to any 
physicist, only to you. And you’re 
my— For that reason only, 
probably.” 

“Now, Selene.” He tried to man- 
age a soothing tone, but betrayed 
far too much impatience. 

“No, I don’t care about that 
really. You’ve told me I have this 
one task and I’ve tried to con- 
centrate on it and sometimes I 
think I have it, mathematics or not. 
I can visualize it— the kind of thing 
that must be done — and then it slips 
away. But what’s the use when the 
Pump will destroy us all anyway? 



Haven’t I told you I distrusted the 
exchange of field intensities?” 
Neville said, “I’ll ask you again. 
Are you ready to tell me that the 
Pump will destroy us? Never 
mind might or could. Never mind 
anything but will." 

Selene shook her head angrily. 
“1 can't. It’s too marginal. I can’t 
say it will. But isn’t a simple might 
sufficient in such a case?” 

“Oh, Lord!” 

“Don’t turn up your eyes. Don’t 
sneer. You’ve never tested the 
matter. I told you how it might be 
tested.” 

“You were never much worried 
about it till you started listening 
to this Earthie of yours.” 

“He’s an immigrant. Aren’t you 
going to test it?” 

“No. 1 told you your suggestions 
are impractical. You’re not an 
experimentalist, and what looks 
good in your mind doesn’t neces- 
sarily work in the real world of 
instruments, of randomness -and 
of uncertainty.” 

“The so-called real world of 
your laboratory.” Her face was 
flushed and angry and she held 
her clenched fists at chin level. 
“You waste so much time trying 
to get a vacuum good enough — 
There’s a vacuum up there — up 
there on the surface where I’m 
pointing — with temperatures that, 
at times, are halfway down toward 
absolute zero. Why don’t you try 
experiments on the surface?” 

“To do so would be useless.” 
“How do you know? You won’t 
try. Ben Denison tried. He took the 
trouble to devise a system he could 
use on the surface and he set it up 
when he went to inspect the solar 



54 



GALAXY 




batteries. He wanted you to come 
and you wouldn’t. Do you remem- 
ber? It was a very simple thing, 
something even I could describe to 
you now that it’s been described 
to me. He ran it at day tempera- 
tures and again at night tempera- 
tures and that was enough to guide 
him to a new line of research with 
the Pionizer.” 

“Howsimpleyou make it sound!” 
“How simple it is. Once he 
found out I was an Intuitionist, he 
talked to me as you never did. He 
explained his reasons for thinking 
that the strengthening of the strong 
nuclear interaction is indeed ac- 
cumulating catastrophically in the 
neighborhood of Earth. It will only 
be a few years before the sun ex- 
plodes and sends the strengthening 
in ripples — ” 

“No, no, no, no\" Neville 
shouted. “I’ve seen his results 
and I’m not impressed.” 

“You’ve seen them?” 

“Yes, of course. Do you suppose 
I let him work in our laboratories 
without making sure I know what 
he’s doing? I’ve seen his results 
and they’re worth nothing. He 
deals with tiny deviations that are 
well within experimental error. If 
he wants to believe that those de- 
viations have significance and if 
you want to believe him — go ahead. 
But no amount of belief will make 
them have significance if, in fact, 
they don’t. 

“What do you want to believe, 
Barron?” 

“I want the truth.” 

“But haven’t you decided in ad- 
vance what the truth must be by 
your own gospel? You want the 
Pump on the Moon, don’t you, so 



that you need have nothing to do 
with the surface? And anything 
that might prevent that is not the 
truth — by definition?” 

“I won’t argue with you. I want 
the Pump — and even more I want 
the other, the thing I’m working 
toward. One’s no good without the 
other. Are you sure you haven’t—” 
“I haven’t.” 

“Will you?” 

Selene whirled on him again, her 
feet tapping rapidly on the ground 
in such a way as to keep her 
bobbing in the air to the tune of an 
angry clatter. 

“I won’t tell him anything,” she 
said, “but I must have more in- 
formation. You have no informa- 
tion for me, but he may have — or 
he may get it with the experiments 
you won’t perform. I’ve got to 
talk to him and find out what he 
is going to find out. If you get be- 
tween him and me, you’ll never 
have what you want. And you 
needn’t fear his getting it before I 
do. He’s too used to Earth thinking 
— he won’t take that last step. I 
will.” 

“All right. And don’t forget the 
difference between Earth and 
Moon, either. This is your world— 
you have no other. This man, 
Denison, this Ben, this immigrant, 
having come from Earth to Moon 
can, if he chooses, return from 
Moon to Earth. You can never go 
to the Earth — never. You are a 
Lunarite forever.” 

“A Moon maiden,” said Selene 
derisively. 

“No maiden,” said Neville. 
“Though you may have to wait a 
long while before I confirm the 
matter once again.” 



THE GODS THEMSELVES

She seemed unmoved by the 
threat. 

He said, “And about this big 
danger of explosion. If the risk 
involved in changing the basic 
constants of a Universe is so great, 
why haven’t the para-men, who are 
so far advanced beyond us in tech- 
nology, stopped Pumping?” 

He strode out of her apartment. 

She faced the closed door, her 
jaw taut. She said, “Because condi- 
tions are different for them, you 
incredible jerk.” 

But she was speaking to herself. 
He was gone. 

She kicked the lever that let 
down her bed, threw herself into it 
and seethed. How much closer was 
she now to the real objective for 
which Barron and those others had 
been aiming for years? 

No closer. 

Energy. Everyone searched for 
energy. The magic word. The 
cornucopia. The key to universal 
plenty. And yet energy was not all. 

If one found energy — one could 
find the other, too. If one found the 
key to energy, the key to the other 
would be obvious. She knew the key 
to the other would be obvious if 
she could but grasp some subtle 
point that would appear simple the 
moment it was grasped. (Good 
heavens, she had been so infected 
by Barron’s chronic suspicion that 
even in her thoughts she was call- 
ing it the other!) 

No Earthman would grasp that 
subtle point because no Earthman 
had reason to look for it. 

Ben Denison would find it for 
her, then, without finding it for 
himself. 

Except that — if the Universe 



were to be destroyed, what did any- 
thing matter?

D enison tried to beat down 
his self-consciousness. Time 
and again he made a groping mo- 
tion as though to hitch up the pants 
he was not wearing. He wore only 
sandals and the scantiest of briefs, 
which were uncomfortably tight. 
And, of course, he carried the 
blanket. 

Selene, who was similarly ac- 
coutered, laughed. “Now, Ben, 
there’s nothing wrong with your 
bare body, barring a certain flabbi- 
ness. It’s perfectly in fashion here. 
In fact, take off your briefs if 
they’re binding you.” 

“No!” Denison muttered. He 
shifted the blanket so that it draped 
over his abdomen and she snatched 
it from him. 

She said, “Now give me that 
thing. What kind of Lunarite will 
you make if you bring your Earth 
modesties here? You know that 
prudery is only the other side of 
prurience. The words are even on 
the same page in the dictionary.” 
“1 have to get used to this, 
Selene.” 

“You might start by looking at 
me once in a while without having 
your glance slide off me as though 
1 were coated with oil. You look at 
other women quite efficiently, I 
notice.” 

“If I look at you—” 

“Then you’ll seem too interested 
and you’ll be embarrassed. But if 
you look hard you’ll get used to it 
and you’ll stop noticing. Look, I’ll 



56 



GALAXY 




stand still and you stare. I’ll take 
off my briefs.” 

Denison groaned. “Selene, there 
are people all around and you’re 
making intolerable fun of me. 
Please keep walking and let me get 
used to the situation.” 

“All right, but 1 hope you notice 
the people who pass us don’t look 
at us.” 

“They don’t look at you. They 
look at me all right. They’ve prob- 
ably never seen so old-looking and 
ill-shaped a person.” 

“They probably haven’t,” agreed 
Selene cheerfully, “but they’ll just 
have to get used to it.” 

Denison walked on in misery, 
conscious of every gray hair on his 
chest and every quiver of his 
paunch. It was only when the pas- 
sageway thinned out and the people 
passing were fewer in number that 
he began to feel a certain relief. 

He began to look about him cu- 
riously, not as aware of Selene’s 
conical breasts or of her smooth 
thighs as he had been. The cor- 
ridor seemed endless. 

“How far have we come?” 

“Are you tired?” Selene was con- 
trite. “We could have taken a 
scooter. I forget you’re from 
Earth.” 

“I should hope you would. Isn’t 
that the ideal for an immigrant? 
I’m not the least bit tired. Hardly 
the least bit tired at any rate. What 
I am is a little cold.” 

“Purely your imagination, Ben,” 
said Selene firmly. “You just think 
you ought to feel cold because so 
much of you is bare. Put it out of 
your head.” 

“Easy to say.” He sighed. “I’m 
walking well, I hope.” 



“Very well. I’ll have you kanga- 
rooing yet.” 

“And participating in glider 
races down the surface slopes? 
Remember, I’m moderately ad- 
vanced in years. But really — how 
far have we come?” 

“Two miles, I should judge.” 
“Good Lord! How many miles of 
corridors are there altogether?” 
“Tm afraid I don’t know. The 
residential corridors make up com- 
paratively little of the total. There 
are the mining corridors, geological 
ones, the industrial, the mycol- 
ogical — I’m sure there must be 
several hundred miles altogether.” 
“Do you have maps?” 

“Of course there are maps. We 
can’t work blind.” 

“I mean you personally.” 

“Not with me, but I don’t need 
maps for this area — it’s quite 
familiar to me. I used to wander 
about here as a child. These are old 
corridors. Most of the new cor- 
ridors — and we average two or 
three miles of new corridors a year, 
I think — are in the north. 1 couldn’t 
work my way through them with- 
out a map. Maybe not even. with a 
map.” 

“Where are we heading?” 

“I promised you an unusual 
sight — no, not me, so don’t say it — 
and you’ll have it. It’s the Moon’s 
most unusual mine and it’s com- 
pletely off the ordinary tourist 
trails.” 

“Don’t tell me you’ve got dia- 
monds on the Moon?” 

“Better than that.” 

T he corridor walls were un- 
finished here — gray rock, dimly 
but adequately lit by patches of 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



57 




electroluminescence. The tempera- 
ture was comfortable and the 
ventilation so effective that there 
was no sensation of air movement. 
Yet two hundred feet above was a 
surface subjected to alternate fry- 
ing and freezing as the sun came 
and went on its grand biweekly 
swing from horizon to horizon. 

“Is all this airtight?” asked 
Denison, suddenly uncomfortably 
aware that he was below an ocean 
of vacuum that extended through 
all infinity. 

“Oh, yes. Those walls are im- 
pervious. They’re all booby- 
trapped, too. If the air pressure 
drops as much as ten percent in 
any section of the corridors there 
is such a hooting and howling from 
sirens as you have never heard and 
such a flashing of arrows and blaz- 
ing of signs directing you to safety 
as you have never seen.” 

“How often does it happen?” 

“Not often. I don’t think any- 
one has been killed through air 
lack for at least five years.” Then, 
with sudden defensiveness; “You 
have natural catastrophes on Earth. 
A big quake or a tidal wave can kill 
thousands.” 

“No argument, Selene.” He 
threw up his hands. “I surrender.” 

“All right,” she said. “1 didn’t 
mean to get excited. Do you hear 
that?” 

She stopped in an attitude of 
listening. 

Denison listened, too, and shook 
his head. Suddenly he looked 
around. “It’s so quiet. Where is 
everybody? Are you sure we’re not 
lost?” 

“This isn’t a natural cavern with 
unknown passageways. You have 



those on Earth, haven’t you? I’ve 
seen photographs.” 

“Yes, most of them are lime- 
stone caves and formed by water. 
That certainly can’t be the case on 
the Moon, can it?” 

“So we can’t be lost,” Selene 
said, smiling. “If we’re alone — put 
it down to superstition.” 

“To what?” Denison looked 
startled and his face creased in an 
expression of disbelief. 

“Don’t do that,” she said. “Your 
face gets all lined. That’s right. 
Smooth out. You look much better 
than you did when you first arrived, 
you know. That’s low gravity and 
exercise.” 

“And trying to keep up with nude 
young ladies who have an uncom- 
mon amount of time off and un- 
common lack of better things to do 
than to go on busman’s holidays.” 
“Now you’re treating me as you 
would a tourist guide again. And 
I’m not nude.” 

“At that, even nudity is less 
frightening than Intuitionism. But 
what’s this about superstition?” 
“Not really superstition, I sup- 
pose, but most people do tend to 
stay away from this part of the cor- 
ridor complex — ” 

“But why?” 

“Because of what I’m going to 
show you.” They were walking 
again. “Hear it now?” 

She stopped and Denison listened 
anxiously. He said, “You mean 
that small tapping sound. Tap — 
tap ... is that what you mean?” 
“That’s exactly what I mean,” 
she said delightedly. “Come on.” 
She ran ahead in the slow-motion 
strides of the Lunarite in unhur- 
ried flight. He followed her, at- 



58 



GALAXY 




tempting to ape the gait. 

“Here — here — ” 

Denison’s eye followed Selene’s 
eagerly pointing finger. 

“Good Lord,’’ he said. “Where’s 
it coming from?” 

T *HERE was a drip of what was 
clearly water, each drop strik- 
ing a small ceramic trough that led 
into the rock wall. 

“From the rocks. We do have 
water on the Moon, you know. 
Most of it we can bake out of 
gypsum — enough for our purposes. 
We conserve it pretty well.” 

“1 know. 1 know. I’ve never yet 
been able to manage one complete 
shower. How you people manage 
to stay clean I have no idea.” 

“1 told you. First, wet yourself. 
Then turn off the water and smear 
just a little detergent on you. You 
rub it — Oh, Ben, I’m not going 
through it again. And there’s noth- 
ing on the Moon to get you all that 
dirty anyway. But that’s not what 
we’re talking about. In one or two 
places there are actually water 
deposits, usually as ice near the 
surface in a mountain’s shadow. If 
our tunnel hits water it drips out. 
This deposit has been dripping since 
the corridor was first driven 
through — and that was eight years 
ago.” 

“But why the superstition?” 
“Water is the great material 
resource on which the Moon de- 
pends. We drink it, wash with it, 
grow our food with it, make our 
oxygen with it, keep everything 
going with it. Free water can’t help 
but get a lot of respect. Once this 
drip was discovered, plans to extend 
the tunnels in this direction were 



abandoned till it would stop. Even 
the corridor walls were left un- 
finished.” 

“That sounds like superstition 
right there.” 

“A kind of awe, maybe. The 
drip wasn’t expected to last for 
more than a few months — accord- 
ing to precedent. So after this one 
had passed its first anniversary it 
began to seem eternal. In fact, 
that’s what it’s called: ‘The Eter- 
nal.’ You’ll even find it marked that 
way on the maps. Naturally people 
have come to attach importance to 
it — a feeling that if it stops it will 
mean some sort of bad fortune.” 
Denison laughed. 

Selene said warmly, “No one 
really believes it, but everyone 
partly believes it. You see, it’s not 
really eternal and it must stop some 
time. As a matter of fact, the rate 
of drip is only about a third of what 
it was when it was first discovered, 
so that the source is slowly drying 
up. I’ve been told some people feel 
that if the drip happened to stop 
when they were actually here they 
would share in the bad fortune.” 

“1 take it you don’t believe this.” 
“Whether 1 believe it or not isn’t 
the point. You see. I’m quite cer- 
tain that it won’t stop sharply 
enough for anyone to be able to 
take the blame. It will just drip 
more and more slowly and no one 
will ever be able to pinpoint the 
exact time when it stopped. So why 
worry?” 

“I agree with you.” 

“I do, however,” she said, mak- 
ing the transition smoothly, “have 
other worries, and I’d like to dis- 
cuss them with you while we’re 
alone.” She spread out the blanket 



the gods themselves 



59 




and sat down on it cross-legged, 

“Which is why you really brought 
me here?” He dropped to hip and 
elbow, facing her. 

She said, “See, you can look at 
me easily now. You’re getting used 
to me. Surely there were times on 
Earth when near-nudity wasn’t 
something to be exclaimed over.” 

“Times and places,” agreed 
Denison, “but not since the passing 
of the Crisis. In my lifetime — ” 

“Well, on the Moon, ‘do as the 
Lunarites do’ is a good enough 
guide for behavior.” 

“Are you going to tell me why 
you really brought me here? Or 
shall I suspect you of planning 
seduction?” 

“I could carry through seduc- 
tion quite comfortably at home, 
thank you. This is different. The 
surface would have been best for 
our talk, but getting ready to go out 
on the surface would have attracted 
a great deal of attention. Coming 
here didn’t — and this place is the 
only spot in town where we can be 
reasonably safe from interrup- 
tion.” 

She hesitated. 

“Well?” said Denison. 

“Barron is angry. Very angry, in 
fact.” 

“I’m not surprised. I warned you 
he would be if you told him that I 
knew you were an Intuitionist. Why 
did you feel it necessary to tell 
him?” 

“Because it is difficult to keep 
things for long from my — compan- 
ion. Probably, though, he doesn’t 
consider me that any longer.” 

“I’m sorry.” 

“Oh, it was turning sour anyway. 
It’s lasted long enough. What 



bothers me more — much more— is 
that he violently refuses to accept 
your interpretation of the Pionizer 
experiments you ran after the sur- 
face observations.” 

“I told you the way it would be.” 
“He said he saw your results.” 
“He glanced at them and 
grunted.” 

“It’s rather disillusioning. Does 
everyone just believe what he wants 
to?” 

“As long as possible. Sometimes 
longer.” 

“What about you?” 

“You mean — am I human? Cer- 
tainly. I don’t believe I’m really 
old. I believe I’m quite attractive. 
I believe you seek out my company 
because you think I’m charming — 
even when you insist on turning the 
conversation to physics.” 

“Please! I mean the question 
seriously.” 

“Well, I suspect Neville told you 
that the data I had gathered were 
not significant beyond the margin 
of error and that this makes them 
unreliable — and he’s right enough. 
Still, I prefer to believe they have 
the meaning I expected them to 
have to begin with.” 

“Just because you want to believe 
that?” 

<<"^TOT just because. Look at 
it this way. Suppose there 
is no harm in the Pump, but 1 insist 
on thinking there is harm. In that 
case I will turn out to be a fool and 
my scientific reputation will be 
badly damaged. But I already am a 
fool in the eyes of the people who 
count and I have no scientific 
reputation.” 

“Why is that, Ben? You’ve 



60 



GALAXY 




hinted around something in your 
background several times. Can’t 
you tell me the whole story?” 
“You’d be surprised at how little 
there is to tell. At the age of 
twenty-five I was still such a child 
that I had to amuse myself by in- 
sulting a fool for no reason other 
than that he was a fool. Since his 
folly was not his fault, I was the 
greater fool to do it. My insult 
drove him to heights he couldn’t 
possibly have scaled otherwise.” 
“You’re talking of Hallam?” 
“Yes. And as he rose, I fell. And 
eventually 1 dropped to — the 

Moon.” 

“Is that so bad?” 

“No, I rather think it’s good. So 
let’s say he did me a favor the long 
way around. And let’s get back to 
what I was talking about. I’ve just 
explained that if I believe the Pump 
to be harmful and am wrong — I 
lose nothing. On the other hand, if 
I believe the Pump to be harmless 
and am wrong — I will be helping to 
destroy the world. To be sure. I’ve 
already lived most of my life and 1 
suppose I can argue myself into 
believing that I have no great cause 
to love humanity. However, only a 
few people have hurt me — and if I 
hurt everyone in return that would 
be unconscionable usury.” The 
Earthman smiled. “Then, too, if 
you’d rather have a less noble 
reason, Selene, consider my daugh- 
ter. Just before I left for the Moon 
she applied for permission to have 
a ‘child. She’ll probably get it and 
before long I’ll be — if you don’t 
mind my saying so — a grandfather. 
Somehow I’d like to see my grand- 
child have a normal life expectancy. 
So I prefer to believe the Pump is 



dangerous and to act on that 
belief.” 

Selene said intensely. “But here’s 
my point. Is the Pump dangerous 
or is it not? I mean, the truth — and 
not what anyone wants to believe.” 
“I should ask you that. You’re 
the Intuitionist. What does your 
intuition say?” 

“That’s what bothers me, Ben. 1 
can’t make it come out really cer- 
tain either way. 1 tend to feel the 
Pump is harmful, but maybe that’s 
because I want to believe it is.” 
“All right. Maybe you do want 
to believe so. Why?” 

Selene smiled ruefully and 
shrugged. “It would be fun for 
me to find Barron wrong. When 
he thinks he’s sure, he’s so vituper- 
atively sure.” 

“I know. You want to see his 
face when he’s forced to back down. 
I’m well aware of how intense such 
a desire can be. For instance, if the 
Pump were dangerous and 1 could 
prove it, I might conceivably be 
hailed as the savior of humanity. 
Yet I swear that I’d be more inter- 
ested in the look on Hallam’s face. 
I’m not proud of that feeling so I 
suspect that what I’ll do is insist 
on an equal share of the credit with 
Lamont — who deserves it — and 
confine my pleasure to watching 
Lament’s face when he watches 
Hallam’s face. The pettishness will 
then be one place removed. But I’m 
beginning to speak nonsense. 
Selene?” 

“Yes, Ben.” 

“When did you find out you were 
an Intuitionist?” 

“I don’t quite know.” 

“You took physics in college, I 
imagine.” 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



61 




“Oh, yes. Some math, too, but I 
was never good at that. Come to 
think of it, I wasn’t particularly 
good in physics, either. I used to 
guess the answers when 1 was 
desperate — you know, guess what I 
was supposed to do to get the right 
answers. Very often it worked. 
Then I would be asked to explain 
and I couldn’t. They suspected me 
of cheating but could never prove 
anything.’’ 

“They didn’t suspect Intu- 
itionism?’’ 

“1 don’t think so. But then, I 
didn’t either. Until — well, one of 
my first sex-mates was a physicist. 
In fact, he was the father of my 
child. He had a physics problem 
and he told me about it when we 
were lying in bed afterward— just to 
have something to talk about, I 
suppose. And I said, ‘You know 
what it sounds like to me?’ and told 
him. He tried it just for the fun of it, 
he said, and it worked. Actually 
that was the first step to the Pion- 
izer, which you said was much 
better than the proton synchro- 
tron.’’ 

mean that was your 
X idea?” Denison stuck his 
finger under the dripping water and 
paused as he was about to raise it 
to his mouth. “Is this water safe?” 

“It’s perfectly sterile,” said 
Selene, “and it goes into the general 
reservoir for treatment. It’s satu- 
rated with sulfates, carbonates and 
a few other items, however. You 
won’t like the taste.” 

Denison rubbed his finger on his 
briefs. “So you invented the 
Pionizer!” 

“Not invented. I had the original 



concept. It took lots of develop- 
ment, mostly by Barron.” 

Denison shook his head. “You 
know, Selene, you’re an amazing 
phenomenon. You should be under 
observation by the molecular 
biologists.” 

“Should I? That’s not my idea of 
a thrill.” 

“The legal climax to the big 
trend toward genetic engineering 
came about a half-century ago — ” 
“I know. The case flopped and 
was thrown out of court. That 
whole type of study is illegal now — 
insofar as research can be made 
illegal. 1 know people who’ve done 
work on it just the same.” 

“I dare say. On the trail of 
Intuitionism?” 

“No. I don’t think so.” 

“Ah. That’s my point. At the 
height of the push for genetic 
engineering there was this attempt 
to stimulate Intuitionism. Almost 
all the great scientists and artists 
had intuitive ability, of course, and 
there was the feeling that this was 
the single great key to creativity. 
One could argue that superior 
capacity for intuition was the 
product of a particular gene com- 
bination and all sorts of specu- 
lations rose as to which gene 
combination that was.” 

“I suspect there are many 
possible combinations that would 
satisfy.” 

“And I suspect that if you are 
consulting your intuition here, you 
are correct. But there were also 
those who insisted that a single 
gene — or a single small related 
group of genes — was of particular 
importance to the combination, so 
that one might speak of an Intu- 



62 



GALAXY 




ition Gene. Then the whole thing 
collapsed.” 

“As I said.” 

“But before it collapsed,” Deni- 
son went on, “there had been 
attempts to alter genes to increase 
the intensity of Intuitionism and 
there were those who insisted that 
some success had been achieved. 
The altered genes entered the gene 
pool. I’m positive, and if you 
happened to inherit — Were any of 
your grandparents involved in the 
program?” 

“Not as far as i know,” said 
Selene, “but I can’t rule it out. One 
of them might have been. If you 
don’t mind. I’m not going to inves- 
tigate the matter. I don’t want to 
know.” 

“Perhaps that’s wise. The whole 
field became fearfully unpopular 
with the general public and anyone 
who can be considered the product 
of genetic engineering would not 
exactly be greeted gladly. Intu- 
itionism, they said, for instance, 
was inseparable from certain 
undesirable characteristics.” 

“Well, thank you.” 

"They said. At any rate, to 
possess intuition is to inspire a 
certain envy and enmity in others. 
Even as gentle and saintlike an 
Intuitionist as Michael Faraday 
aroused the envy and hatred of 
Humphry Davy. Who’s to say the 
capacity to arouse envy is not a 
flaw in character? And in your 
case — ” 

Selene said, “Surely 1 don’t 
arouse your envy and hatred?” 

“I don’t think you do. What 
about Neville’s, though?” 

Selene was silent. 

Denison said, “By the time you 



got to Neville you were well known 
as an Intuitionist, I suppose.” 

“Not well known, 1 would say. 
Some physicists suspected it. I’m 
sure. However, they don’t like to 
give up credit here any more than 
on Earth— and I suppose they 
convinced themselves, more or less, 
that whatever I had said to them 
was just a meaningless guess. But 
Barron knew, of course.” 

“1 see.” 

Selene’s lips twitched. “Some- 
how I get the feeling that you want 
to say: Oh, that’s why he bothers 
with you." 

“Of course not, Selene. You’re 
quite attractive enough to be 
desired for your own sake.” 

“I think so, too, but every little 
bit helps and Barron was bound to 
be interested in my Intuitionism, 
too. Why shouldn’t he be? Only he 
insisted I keep my job as tourist 
guide. He said I was an important 
natural resource of the Moon and 
he didn’t want Earth monopolizing 
me the way they monopolized the 
synchrotron.” 

“An odd thought. But perhaps 
he also felt that the fewer who 
knew of your Intuitionism, the 
fewer who would suspect your 
contribution to what would other- 
wise be put to his sole credit.” 

“Now you sound like Barron 
yourself.” 

“Do I? And is it possible he gets 
rather annoyed with you when your 
Intuitionism is working particu- 
larly well?” 

Selene shrugged. “Barron is a 
suspicious man. We all have our 
faults.” 

“Is it wise to be alone with me, 
then?” 



THE GODS THEMSELVES

S ELENE said sharply, “Don’t 
get hurt because I defend him. 
He doesn’t really suspect the 
possibility of sexual misbehavior 
between us. You’re from Earth. In 
fact, I might as well tell you he 
encourages our companionship. 
He thinks I can learn from you?” 
“And have you?” Denison asked 
coldly. 

“I have. But that isn’t my chief 
reason for spending time with you.” 
“What is?” 

“As you well know,” said Selene, 
“and as you want to hear me say, 
I enjoy your company. Otherwise 
I would get what I want in much 
less time.” 

“All right, Selene. Friends?” 
“Friends! Absolutely.” 

“What have you learned from me, 
then? May I know?” 

“That would take a while to ex- 
plain. You know that the reason 
we can’t set up a Pump Station 
anywhere we want to is that we 
can’t locate the para-Universe, 
even though they can locate us. 
That might be because they are 
much more intelligent or much 
more technologically advanced 
than we are — ” 

“Not necessarily the same 
thing,” muttered Denison. 

“I know. That’s why I put in the 
‘or.’ But the truth might also be 
that we are neither particularly 
stupid nor particularly backward. 
It might be something as simple 
as the fact that the para-beings 
offer the harder target. If ‘strong’ 
nuclear interaction is still stronger 
in the para-Universe they would be 
bound to have much smaller suns 
and, very likely, much smaller 
planets. Their individual world 



could be harder to locate than ours 
would be.” 

Denison nodded. 

“Or then again,” she went on, 
“suppose it’s the electromagnetic 
field they detect. The electromag- 
netic field of a planet is much 
larger than the planet itself and is 
much easier to locate. And that 
would mean that while they can 
detect the Earth, they can’t detect 
the Moon, which has no electro- 
magnetic field to speak of. That’s 
why, perhaps, we’ve failed in our 
effort to make contact and set up 
a Pump Station on the Moon. And 
if their small planets lack a signif- 
icant electromagnetic field, it’s no 
wonder we can’t locate them.” 

Denison said, “That’s an attrac- 
tive idea.” 

“Next, consider the inter- 
Universal exchange in properties 
that serves to weaken their strong 
nuclear interaction, cooling their 
suns while strengthening ours, 
heating and exploding our suns. 
What might that imply? Suppose 
they can collect energy one-way 
without our help but only at ruin- 
ously low efficiencies. Under 
ordinary circumstances to do so 
would therefore be utterly imprac- 
tical. They would need us to help 
direct concentrated energy in their 
direction by supplying tungsten- 186 
to them and accepting plutonium- 
186 in return. But suppose our 
galactic arm implodes into a 
quasar. That would produce an 
energy concentration in the 
neighborhood of the solar system 
enormously greater than now 
exists and one that might persist 
more than a million years.” 

“Aha—” 



64 



GALAXY 




“Once that quasar forms, even a 
ruinously low efficiency becomes 
sufficient. It wouldn’t matter to 
them thereafter whether we were 
destroyed or not. In fact, we might 
argue that it would be safer for 
them if we did explode. While we 
exist we might stop the Pump for 
any of a variety of reasons and they 
would be helpless to start it again. 
But after an explosion they are 
home free — no one can interfere. 
And that’s why people who say, 
‘If the Pump is so dangerous, why 
don’t those terribly clever para- 
men stop it?’ don’t know what 
they’re talking about.” 

“Did Neville give you that argu- 
ment about the para-men?” 

“Yes, he did.” 

“But the para-sun would keep 
cooling down, wouldn’t it?” 

“What does that matter?” re- 
turned Selene impatiently. “With 
the Pump, they wouldn’t be depen- 
dent on their sun for anything.” 
Denison took a deep breath. 
“You can’t possibly know this, 
Selene, but there was a rumor on 
Earth to the effect that Lamont 
received a message from the para- 
men to the effect that the Pump was 
dangerous, but that they couldn’t 
stop it. No one took it seriously, 
of course, but suppose it’s true. 
Suppose Lamont did receive such 
a message. Might it be that some of 
the para-men were humanitarian 
enough to wish not to destroy a 
world with cooperating intelli- 
gences in it, and were squelched by 
an oh-so-practical majority?” 
Selene nodded. “I suppose that’s 
possible. All this 1 knew, or rather, 
intuited, before you came on the 
scene. But then you agreed with 



me when I said that nothing be- 
tween one and the infinite made any 
.sense. Remember?” 

“Of course.” 

“All right. The differences 
between our Universe and the 
para-Universe lie so obviously in 
the strong nuclear interaction that 
so far it’s all that’s been studied. 
But there is more than one inter- 
action — there are four. In addition 
to the strong nuclear, there is the 
electromagnetic, the weak nuclear 
and the gravitational, with inten- 
sity ratios of — ” She paused, wet 
her finger under the drip, traced the 
figures on the wall: 130 : 1 : 10 : 

10 — “But if four, why not an 

infinite number, with all the others 
too weak to be delectable or to 
influence our Universe in any 
way?” 

Denison said, “If an interaction 
is too weak to be detectable or to 
exert influence in any way, then by 
any operational definition, it 
doesn’t exist.” 

“In this Universe,” said Selene, 
with a snap. “Who knows what 
does or does not exist in the para- 
Universes? With an infinite number 
of possible interactions, each of 
which can vary infinitely in inten- 
sity compared to any one of them 
taken as standard, the number of 
different possible Universes that 
can exist is infinite.” 

“Possibly the infinity of the 
continuum — aleph-one, rather than 
aleph-null.” 

Selene frowned. “What does 
that mean?” 

“It’s not important. Go on.” 

Selene said, “Instead, then, of 
trying to work with the one para- 
Universe that has impinged itself 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



65 




on us and which may not suit our 
needs at all, why don’t we instead 
try to work out which Universe, 
out of all the infinite possibilities, 
best suits us, and is most easily 
located? Let us design a Universe — 
for whatever we design must exist — 
and search for it.” 

Denison smiled. “Selene, I’ve 
thought of exactly the same thing. 
And while there’s no law that states 
I can’t be completely wrong, it’s 
very unlikely that anyone as bril- 
liant as myself can be completely 
wrong when someone as brilliant 
as yourself comes to exactly the 
same conclusion independently. 
Do you know what?” 

“What?” asked Selene. 

“I’m beginning to like your 
damned Moon food. Or I’m getting 
used to it. Let’s go back home and 
eat. Then we can start working out 
our plans. And you know what 
else?” 

“What?” 

“As long as we’ll be working 
together, how about one kiss — as 
experimentalist to intuitionist?” 
Selene considered. She said, 
“How about trying one as man to 
woman?” 

“I think I can manage that. But 
what do I do so as not to be clumsy 
about it? What are- the Moon rules 
for kissing?” 

“Follow instinct,” Selene said. 
Denison carefully placed his 
arms behind his back and leaned 
toward Selene. Then, after a while, 
he placed his arms behind her back. 

13 

<< * actually kissed 

him back,” Selene said. 



“Oh, did you?” snorted Barron 
Neville. “Well, that’s valor beyond 
the call of duty.” 

“I don’t know. It wasn’t that 
bad. In fact — ” she smiled — “he 
was rather touching about it. He 
was afraid he would be clumsy andk 
began by putting his arms behind 
his back — so he wouldn’t crush me, 

I suppose.” 

“Spare me the details.” 

“Why? What the hell do you 
care?” She flared ' suddenly. 
“You’re Mister Platonic, aren’t 
you?” 

“Do you want it different? 
Now?” 

“You needn’t perform to order.” 
“But you had better. When do 
you expect to give us what we 
need?” - 

“As soon as I can.” i 

“Without his knowing?” 

“He’s interested only in energy. ”i 
“And in saving the world,” 
mocked Neville. “And in being a 
hero. And in showing everybody. 
And in kissing you.” 

“He admits to all that. What do 
you admit to?” 

“Impatience,” Neville said an- 
grily. “Lots of impatience.” 

14 

AM glad,” Denison said 
A deliberately, “that the day- 
time is over.” He held out his right 
arm and stared at it, encased in its 
protective layers. “The Lunar sun 
is one thing I can’t get used to and 
don’t want to get used to. Even this 
suit seems a natural thing to me in 
comparison.” 

“What’s wrong with the sun?” 
asked Selene. 



66 GALAXY; 




“Don’t tell me you like it, 
Selene.” 

“No, of course not. I hate it. But 
then 1 never see it. You're an— 
You’re used to the sun.” 

“Not the way it is here. It shines 
out of a black sky. It dazzles the 
stars away instead of muffling 
them. It is hot, hard and dangerous. 
It is an enemy — and while it’s in 
the sky I can’t help but feel that 
none of our attempts at reducing 
field intensity will succeed.” 

“That’s superstition, Ben. The 
sun has nothing to do with it. We 
were in the crater shadow anyway 
and it was just like night. Stars 
and all.” 

“Not quite,” said Denison. 
“Any time we looked north we 
could see that stretch of sunlight 
glittering. I hated to see it, yet the 
direction dragged at my eyes. And 
every time I looked I could feel the 
hard ultraviolet springing at my 
viewplate.” 

“That’s imagination. In the first 
place, there’s no ultraviolet to 
speak of in reflected light— in the 
second, your suit protects you 
: against radiation.” 

“Not against heat. Not very 
much.” 

“But it’s night now.” 

“Yes,” said Denison with satis- 
faction, “and this I like.” He 
looked about with a continuing 
wonder. Earth was in the sky, of 
course, in its accustomed place, a 
fat crescent bellying to the south- 
west. Constellation Orion was 
above it, a hunter rising out of the 
brilliant curved chair of Earth. The 
horizon glittered in the dim Earth- 
light. 

“It’s beautiful,” he said. Then: 



“Selene, is the Pionizer showing 
anything?” 

Selene, who had been looking at 
the skies without comment, stepped 
toward the maze of equipment that 
had been assembled in the shadow 
of the crater over the past three 
alterations of day and night. 

“Not yet,” she said, “but that’s 
good news really. The field inten- 
sity is holding at just over fifty.” 

“Not low enough,” said Denison. 

Selene said, “It can be lowered. 
I’m sure that all the parameters 
are suitable.” 

“The magnetic field, too?” 

“I’m not sure about the magnetic 
field.” 

“If we strengthen that, the whole 
thing becomes unstable.” 

“It shouldn’t. I know it 
shouldn’t.” 

“Selene, I trust your intuition 
against everything but the facts. 
It does get unstable. We’ve tried 
it.” 

“1 know, Ben. But not quite with 
this geometry. It’s been holding at 
fifty-two for a phenomenally long 
time. Surely if we begin to hold it 
there for hours instead of minutes, 
we ought to be able to strengthen 
the magnetic field tenfold for a 
period of minutes instead of 
seconds. Let’s try.” 

“Not yet,” said Denison. 

Selene hesitated, then stepped 
back, turning her back. She said, 
“You don’t miss Earth, do you, 
Ben?” 

“No. It’s rather odd, but I don’t. 

I would have thought it inevitable 
that I’d miss blue sky, green plants, 
flowing water — all the phenomena 
represented by the cliche adjective- 
noun combinations peculiar to 



the gods themselves 



67 




Earth. I miss none of them. I don’t 
even dream about them.” 

Selene said, “This sort of thing 
does happen. There are Immies 
who say they experience no home- 
sickness. They’re in the minority, 
of course, and no one had ever been 
able to decide what this minority 
has in common. Guesses run all 
the way from serious emotional 
deficiency — no capacity to feel 
anything — to serious emotional 
excess, a fear to admit homesick- 
ness lest it lead to breakdown.” 

“In my case 1 think the reason is 
plain enough. My life on Earth was 
not very enjoyable for two decades 
and more, while here I work at last 
in a field I have made my own. And 
1 have your help. More than that, 
Selene, I have your company.” 
“You are kind,” Selene said 
gravely, “to place help and com- 
pany in the order of importance you 
do. You don’t seem to need much 
help. Do you seek it for the sake of 
my company?” 

Denison laughed softly. “I’m not 
sure which answer would flatter 
you more.” 

“Try the truth.” 

“The truth is not easy to deter- 
mine when I value both answers 
so much.” He turned back to the 
Pionizer. “The field-intensity still 
holds, Selene.” 

Selene’s faceplate glinted in the 
Earthlight. She said, “Barron says 
that non-homesickness is natural 
and the sign of a healthy mind. He 
says that though the human body 
was adapted to Earth’s surface 
and requires adjustment to the 
Moon, the human brain was not. 
The human brain is so different, 
qualitatively, from all other brains 



that it can be considered a ne^fl 
phenomenon. It has had no time t(U 
become really fixed to Earth’ 9 
surface and can, without adjust- 
ment, accept other environments. 
He says that enclosure in the 
caverns of the Moon may actually 
suit it best of all, for that is but a 
larger version of enclosure in the 
cavern of the skull.” 

“Do you believe that?” asked 
Denison, amused. 

“When Barron talks he can make 
his theories sound very plausible.” 
“I think it can be made equally 
plausible to claim that the comfort 
to be found in the caverns of th^ 
Moon is the result of the fulfillmen 
of the return-to-the-womb fantasy 
In fact,” he added thoughtfully, 
“considering the controll^ tem^ 
perature and pressure, the naturi 
and digestibility of the food, t 
could make a good case for con^ 
sidcring the Lunar colony — I be{ 
your pardon, Selene — the Lunai 
city a deliberate reconstruction o 
the fetal environment.” 

Selene said, “I don’t think Bat 
ron would agree with you for 
minute.” 

“I’m sure he wouldn’t,” sai( 
Denison. He looked at the crescen 
Earth, watching the distant cloud 
banks on edge. He fell into silence 
absorbed in the view, and remainec 
in place though Selene moved baclJ 
to the Pionizer. ]

nest of stars over the serratecj 
Moon horizon where, every once in: 
a while, it seemed to him he saw a 
puff of smoke where a small; 
meteorite might be landing. 

He had pointed, out the phenom- 




68 



GALAXV^I 



enon to Selene during the previous 
Lunar night. She had been 
unconcerned. 

She had explained, “The Earth 
shifts slightly in the sky because of 
the Moon’s libration and every 
once in a while a shaft of Earthlight 
tops a small rise and falls on a bit 
of soil beyond. It comes into view 
like a tiny puff of rising dust. It’s 
common. We pay no attention.” 
Denison had said, “But some- 
times it might be a meteorite. Don’t 
meteorites ever strike?” 

“Of course they do. You’re prob- 
ably hit by several every time 
you’re out. Your suit protects you.” 
“1 don’t mean micro-dust part- 
icles. 1 mean sizable meteorites 
that would really kick up the dust. 
Meteorites that could kill you.” 
“Well, those fall, too, but they 
are few and the Moon is large. No 
one has been hit yet.” 

And as Denison watched the sky 
and thought of that he saw what, in 
the midst of his momentary pre- 
occupation, he took to be a meteor- 
ite. Light streaking through the sky 
could, however, be a meteorite only 
in Earth’s atmosphere and not one 
above airless Moon. 

The light in the sky was man- 
made and Denison had not yet 
sorted out his impressions when it 
became, quite clearly, a small 
rocket vessel sinking rapidly to a 
landing beside him. 

A suited figure emerged, while a 
pilot remained within, barely 
visible as a dark splotch among the 
highlights. 

Denison waited. The etiquette of 
the spacesuit required the new- 
comer joining any group to an- 
nounce himself first. 



“Commissioner Gottstein here,” 
the new arrival said, “as you can 
probably tell from my wobble.” 

“Ben Denison here.” 

“Yes. 1 thought as much.” 

“Have you come here looking for 
me?” 

“Certainly.” 

“In a space-skipper? You 
might” 

“1 might,” said Gottstein. “have 
used Outlet P-Four, which is less 
than a thousand yards from here. 
Yes, indeed. But 1 wasn’t looking 
only for you.” 

“Well, 1 won’t ask for your 
meaning,” 

“There’s no reason for me to 
be coy. Surely you have not ex- 
pected me to be disinterested in 
the fact that you have been carrying 
on experiments on the Lunar 
surface.” 

“It’s been no secret and anyone 
might be interested.” 

“Yet no one seems to know the 
details of the experiments. Except, 
of course, that in some way you 
are working on matters concern- 
ing the Electron Pump.” 

“It’s a reasonable assumption, 
isn’t it?” 

“Is it? It seemed to me that ex- 
periments of such nature, to have 
any value at all, would require 
a rather enormous set-up. This is 
not of my own knowledge, you 
understand. I consulted those who 
would know. And it is quite obvious 
that you are not working with such 
a set-up. It occurred to me, there- 
fore, that you might not be the 
proper focus of my interest. While 
my attention was drawn to you, 
others might be undertaking more 
important tasks.” 



THE GODS THEMSELVES

“Why should I be used as 
distraction?” 

“I don’t know. If I did, 1 would 
be less concerned.” 

“So I have been under ob- 
servation.” 

Gottstein chuckled. “Yes. Since 
you arrived. But while you have 
been working here on the surface, 
we have observed this entire region 
for miles in every direction. Oddly 
enough, it would seem that you 
and your companion are the only 
ones on the Lunar surface for any 
but the most routine of purposes.” 
“Why is that odd?” 

“Because it means you really 
think you’re doing something with 
your gimcrack contraption, what- 
ever it is. I can’t believe you are 
incompetent so I think your expla- 
nation of what you are doing would 
be worth listening to.” 

“1 am experimenting in para- 
physics, Commissioner, precisely 
as rumor has it. To which I can 
add that so far my experiments 
have been only partly successful.” 
“Your companion is, I imagine, 
Selene Lindstrom L., a tourist 
guide.” 

“Yes.” 

“An unusual choice as assistant.” 
“She is intelligent, eager, in- 
terested and extremely attractive.” 
“And willing to work with an 
Earthman?” 

“And quite willing to work with 
an immigrant who will be a Lunar 
citizen as soon as he qualifies for 
that status.” 

Selene was approaching now. 
Her voice rang in their ears. “Good 
day. Commissioner. 1 would have 
liked not to overhear and intrude on 
a private conservation, but in a 

70 



spacesuit overhearing is inevitably I 
anywhere within the horizon.” 
Gottstein turned. “Hello, Misji 
Lindstrom. I did not expect to' 
talk in secrecy. Are you interested 
in para-physics?” 

“Oh, yes.” 

“You are not disheartened by the 
failures of the experiment?” I 
“They are not entirely failures,” 
she said. “They are less a failure 
than Dr. Denison thinks at 
present.” 

“What?” Denison turned sharply 
on his heel, nearly overbalancing 
himself and sending out a spurt 
of dust. 

All three were facing the Pionizer 
now. Above it— just about five fee^ 
above it —light shone like a faft 
star. ! 

ELENE said, “I raised thet 
intensity of the magnetic field 
and the nuclear field remainedi 
stable, in being — then eased fur- 
ther and further and — ” 

“A Leak!” Denison said, “Damnj 
it. I didn’t see it happen.” 
Selene said, “I’m sorry, Ben. 
First you were lost in your own. 
thoughts, then the Commissioner 
arrived — and I couldn’t resist the 
chance to try on my own.” 

Gottstein asked, “Exactly what 
do I see there?” 

Denison said, “Energy being* 
spontaneously given off by matter 
leaking from anothef Universe 
into ours.” 

As he spoke, the light blinked 
out and many yards away a dim- 
mer star came into simultaneous 
being. ! 

Denison lunged toward the : 
Pionizer but Selene, all Lunar |

grace propelled herself across the 
surface more efficiently and 
got there first. She killed the field 
structure and the distant star 

vanished. 

She said, “The leak point isn’t 
stable, you see.” 

“Not on a small scale,” said 
Denison, “but considering that -a 
shift of a light-year is as theoreti- 
cally possible as a shift of a 
hundred yards, one of a hundred 
yards only is miraculous stability.” 
“Not miraculous enough,” said 
Selene flatly. 

Gottstein interrupted. “Let me 
guess at what you’re talking about. 
You mean that matter can leak 
through here, there or anywhere 
in our Universe — at random?” 
“Not quite at random. Com- 
missioner,” said Denison. “The 
probability of leakage drops with 
distance from the Pionizer — and 
rather sharply I should say. The 
sharpness depends on a variety of 
factors and 1 think we’ve tightened 
the situation remarkably. Even so, 
a flip of a few hundred yards is 
quite probable and, as a matter of 
fact, you saw it happen.” 

“And it might have shifted to 
somewhere within the city or within 
our own helmets, perhaps?” 
Denison said impatiently, “No. 
The leak, at least by the techniques 
we use, is heavily dependent on the 
density of matter already present 
in this Universe. The chances are 
virtually nil that the leak point 
would shift from a place of essen- 
tial vacuum to one where an 
atmosphere even a hundredth as 
dense as that within the city or 
within our helmets would exist. 
It would be impractical to expect 



to arrange the leak anywhere but 
into a vacuum in the first place, 
which is why we had to make the 
attempt here on the surface.” 
“Then this is not like the Elec- 
tron Pump?” 

“Not at all,” said Denison. “In 
the Electron Pump there is a two- 
way transfer of matter, here a 
one-way leak. Nor are the Uni- 
verses involved the same.” 
Gottstein said, “1 wonder if you 
would have dinner with me this 
evening. Dr. Denison.” 

Denison hesitated. “Myself 
only?” 

Gottstein attempted a bow in the 
direction of Selene but could ac- 
complish only a grotesque parody 
of one in his spacesuit. “I would 
be charmed to have Miss Lind- 
strom’s company on another occa- 
sion, but on this one I must speak 
with you alone. Dr. Denison.” 

“Oh, go ahead,” Selene said 
crisply as Denison still hesitated. 
“1 have a heavy schedule tomorrow 
anyway, and you’ll need time to 
worry about the leak-point 
instability.” 

Denison said uncertainly, “Well, 
then — Selene, will you let me 
know when your next free day is?” 
“1 always do, don’t 1? And we’ll 
be in touch before then, in any 
case. Why don’t you two go on? 
I’ll take care of the equipment.”

B arron neville shifted 

from foot to foot in the fashion 
made necessary by the restricted 
quarters and the Moon’s gravity. 
In a larger room under a world’s 
stronger pull, he would have walked

back and forth. Here he tilted from 
side to side. 

“Then you're positive it works. 
Right, Selene? You’re positive?” 
“I’m positive,” said Selene. 
“I’ve told you five times by actual 
count.” 

Neville seemed not to be listen- 
ing. He spoke in a low, rapid 
voice. “It doesn’t matter that 
Gottstein was there, then? He 
didn't try to stop the experiment?” 
“No. Of course not.” 

“There was no indication that he 
would try to exert authority — ” 
“Now, Barron, what kind of 
authority could he exert? Will 
Earth send a police force? Besides 
- oh, you know they can’t stop us.” 
Neville stopped moving, stood 
motionless for a while. “They 
don’t know? They still don’t 
know?” 

“Of course they don’t. Ben was 
looking at the stars and then 
Gottstein came. So I tried for the 
field leak, got it — and I had 
already gotten the other. Ben’s 
set-up — ” 

“Don’t call it his set-up. It was 
your idea, wasn’t it?” 

Selene shook her head. “I made 
vague suggestions. The details 
were Ben’s.” 

“But you can reproduce it now. 
For Luna’s sake, we don’t have 
to go to the Earthie for it, do we?” 
“I think I can reproduce enough 
of it now so that our people can 
fill it in.” 

“All right, then. Let’s get 
started.” 

“Not yet. Oh, damn it, Barron, 
not yet.” 

“Why not yet?” 

“We need the energy, too.” 



“But we have that.” 

“Not quite. The leak point is 
unstable— pretty badly unstable.” 
“But that can be fixed up. You 
said so.” 

“I said I thought it could be.” 
“That’s good enough for me.” 
“Just the same, it would be 
better to have Ben work out the 
details and stabilize it.” 

A silence fell between them. 
Neville’s face slowly twisted into 
something approaching hostility. 
“You don’t think I can do it? Is 
that it?” 

Selene said, “Will you come out 
on the surface with me and work 
on it?” 

After another silence Neville said 
unsteadily, “I don’t appreciate 
your sarcasm. And I don’t want 
to have to wait long.” 

“I can’t command the laws of 
nature. But 1 think you won’t 
wait long. Now, if you don’t mind, 
I need my sleep. I’ve got my 
tourists tomorrow.” 

For an instant Neville seemed 
on the point of gesturing to his 
own bed alcove to offer its hospi- 
tality — but the gesture, if that was 
what it was, did not realty come 
to birth and Selene made no sign 
of understanding or even antici- 
pating. She nodded wearily and left. 

16 

O be frank, I had hoped — ” 
J. Gottstein smiled over what 
passed for dessert, a sticky, sweet 
concoction — “that we would have 
seen each other more often.” 
Denison replied, “It is kind of 
you to take such an interest in my 



72 



GALAXY 




work. If the leak instability can 
be corrected, I think my achieve- 
ment — and Miss Lindstrom’s— 
may prove a somewhat significant 
one.” 

“You speak carefully, like a 
scientist. I won’t insult you by 
offering the Lunar equivalent of 
a liqueur — that is the one approxi- 
mation of Earth’s cuisine I have 
simply made up my mind not to 
tolerate. Can you tell me in lay 
language what makes the achieve- 
ment significant?” 

“I can try. Suppose we start with 
the para-Universe. It has a more 
intense strong nuclear interaction 
than our Universe has. Hence 
relatively- small masses of protons 
in the para-Universe can undergo 
the fusion reaction capable of 
supporting a star. Masses equiva- 
lent to our stars would explode 
violently in the para-Universe, 
which has many more but much 
smaller stars than ours does.” 

“I follow that,” said Gottstein. 

“Good. Next, suppose we had a 
much less intense strong nuclear 
interaction than that which pre- 
vails in our Universe. In that 
case, huge masses of protons would 
have so little tendency to fuse that 
a very large mass of hydrogen 
would be needed to support a star. 
Such an anti-para-Universe — one 
that was the opposite of the para- 
Universe, in other words — would 
consist of considerably fewer but 
far larger stars than those in our 
Universe. In fact, if the strong 
nuclear interaction were made 
sufficently weak, a Universe would 
exist that consisted of a single 
star containing all the mass in that 
Universe. It would be a very dense 



star, but relatively non-reactive 
and giving off no more radiation 
than our single sun does, perhaps.” 

Gottstein asked, “Am I wrong — 
or is that the situation that pre- 
vailed in our own Universe before 
the time of the big bang— one vast 
body containing all the universal 
mass?” 

“Yes,” said Denison, “as a 
matter of fact, the anti-para- 
Universe I am picturing comprises 
what some call the cosmic egg, 
cosmeg for short. The point is that 
a cosmeg- Universe is exactly what’s 
needed if we are to probe for one- 
way leakage of matter. The para- 
Universe we are now using with its 
tiny stars is virtually empty space. 
You can probe and probe and touch 
nothing.” 

“The para-men reached us, 
however.” 

“Yes — possibly by following 
magnetie fields. There is some 
reason to think that there are no 
planetary magnetic fields of signif- 
icance in the para-Universe^ which 
deprives us of the advantage they 
have. On the other hand, if we 
probe the cosmeg-Universe we 
cannot fail. The cosmeg is itself the 
entire Universe and wherever we 
probe we strike matter.” 

“But how do you probe for it?” 

Denison hesitated. “That is the 
part I find difficult to explain. 
Pions are the mediating particles 
of the strong nuclear interaction. 
The intensity of the interaction 
depends on the mass of the pions 
and that mass can, under certain 
specialized conditions, be altered. 
The Lunar physicists have devel- 
oped an instrument they call the 
Pionizer, which can be made to do 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



73 




jusl such a thing. Once the pion’s 
mass is decreased, or increased for 
that matter, it is effectively part of 
another Universe; it becomes a 
gateway, a crossing point. If it is 
decreased sufficiently, it can be 
made part of a cosmeg-Universe 
and that’s what we want.” 
Gottstein said, “And you can 
suck in matter from the— the— 
cosmeg- U ni verse?” 

“That part is easy. Once the gate- 
way forms the influx is spontane- 
ous. The matter enters with its own 
laws and is stable when it arrives. 
Gradually the laws of our own 
Universe soak in— the strong inter- 
action grows stronger and the 
matter fuses and begins to give off 
enormous energy.” 

“But if it is super-dense — why 
doesn’t it just expand in a puff of 
smoke?” 

“That, too, would yield energy, 
but what actually happens depends 
on the electromagnetic field — and 
in this particular case the strong 
interaction takes precedence be- 
cause we control the electromag- 
netic field. It would take quite a 
time to explain that.” 

“Well, then, the globe of light 
that I saw on the surface was 
cosmeg material fusing?” 

“Yes, Commissioner.” 

“And that energy can be har- 
nessed for useful purposes?” 
“Certainly. And in any quantity. 
What you saw was the arrival in 
our Universe of micromicrogram 
masses of cosmeg. Nothing, in 
theory, prevents our bringing it 
over in ton lots.” 

“Well, then, your discovery can 
be used to replace the Electron 
Pump.” 



D enison shook his head. 

“No. The use of cosmeg 
energy also alters the properties of 
the Universes in question. The 
strong interaction gradually grows 
more intense in the cosmeg-Uni- 
verse and less intense in ours as the 
laws of nature cross over. That 
means that the cosmeg slowly 
undergoes fusion at a greater 
rate and gradually warms up. 
Eventually—” 

“Eventually,” said Gottstein, 
crossing his arms across his chest 
and narrowing his eyes thought- 
fully, “it explodes in a big bang.” 
“That’s my feeling.” 

“Do you suppose that’s what 
happened to our own Universe ten 
billion years ago?” 

“Perhaps. Cosmogonists have 
wondered why the original cosmic 
egg exploded at some one point in 
time and not at another. One solu- 
tion was to imagine an oscillating 
Universe in which the cosmic egg 
was formed and then at once ex- 
ploded. The oscillating universe has 
been eliminated as a possibility and 
the conclusion is that the cosmic 
egg had to exist for some long 
period of time and then go through 
a crisis of instability for some 
unknown reason.” 

“Which may have been the result 
of the tapping of its energy across 
the Universes?” 

“Possibly, but not necessarily by 
some intelligence. Perhaps there 
are occasional spontaneous leaks.” 
“And when the big bang takes 
place,” said Gottstein, “can we 
still extract energy from the 
cosmeg-Universe?” 

“I’m not sure, but surely that is 
not an immediate worry. The leak- 



74 



GALAXY 




age of our strong-interaction field 
into the cosmeg-Universe would 
have to continue for millions of 
years before pushing it past the 
critical point. And there must be 
other cosmeg-Universes — an infi- 
nite number, perhaps.” 

“What about the change in our 
own Universe?” 

“The strong interaction weakens. 
Slowly, very slowly, our sun cools 
off.” 

“Can we use cosmeg energy to 
make up for that?” 

“That would not be necessary. 
Commissioner,” said Denison 
earnestly. “While the strong inter- 
action in our Universe weakens as 
a result of the cosmeg pump, it 
strengthens through the action of 
our so-called Electron Pump. If we 
adjust the energy productions of the 
two, then — though the laws of 
nature change in the cosmeg- 
Universe and in the para-Universe 
— they do not change in ours. We 
are a highway but not the terminus 
in either direction. Nor need we be 
disturbed on behalf of the termi- 
nuses. The para-men on their side 
may have adjusted themselves to 
the cooling off of their sun which 
may be pretty cool to begin with. 
As for the cosmeg-Universe, there 
is no reason to suspect life can exist 
there. Indeed, by inducing the 
conditions required for the big bang 
we may be setting up a new kind of 
Universe that will eventually grow 
hospitable to life.” 

For a while Gottstein said noth- 
ing. His plump face, in repose, 
seemed emotionless. He nodded, 
apparently following the line of his 
own thoughts. 

Finally he said, “So cosmeg 



energy is not to replace the Electron 
Pump but rather to work with it.” 
“I would suggest that, sir.” 
“Denison, this will set the world 
on its ears! Any difficulty in per- 
suading the scientific leadership 
that the Electron Pump, alone, will 
destroy us should now disappear.” 
“Indeed, yes. The emotional 
reluctance to accept that thesis no 
longer exists. The problem and the 
solutio'^n are presented at the same 
time.” 

“When would you be willing to 
prepare a paper to this effect if I 
guarantee speedy publication?” 
“Can you guarantee that?” 

“In a government-published 
pamphlet, if no other way.” 

“I would prefer to try to neutral- 
ize the leak instability before 
reporting.” 

“Of course.” 

“And 1 think it would be wise,” 
said Denison, “to arrange to have 
Dr. Peter Lamont as co-author. He 
can make the mathematics rigorous 
— something I cannot do. Besides, 
it was through his work that I took 
the course 1 have followed. One 
more point. Commissioner 
“Yes?” 

“1 would suggest that the Lunar 
physicists be involved. One of their 
number. Dr. Barron Neville, might 
well be a third author.” 

“But why? Aren’t you introduc- 
ing unnecessary complications 
now?” 

“It was their Pionizer that made 
my work here possible.” 

“There can be appropriate men- 
tion of that. But did Dr. Barron 
actually work on the project with 
you?” 

“Not directly.” 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



75 




“Then why involve him?” 

Denison looked down and 
brushed his hand thoughtfully over 
the weave of his pants leg. He said, 
“It would be the diplomatic thing 
to do. We would need to set up a 
Cosmeg Pump on the Moon.” 
“Why not on Earth?” 

“In the first place, we need vac- 
uum. This is a one-way transfer and 
not a two-way as in the case of the 
Electron Pump — and the conditions 
necessary to make it practical are 
different in the two cases. The sur- 
face of the Moon has its vacuum 
ready-made. To prepare one on 
Earth would involve an enormous 
effort.” 

“Yet it could be done, couldn’t 
it?” 

“Secondly,” said Denison,” if we 
have two vast energy inflows from 
opposite directions, with our own 
Universe between, there would be 
something like a short circuit if the 
two outlets were too close together. 
Separation by a quarter-million 
miles of vacuum, with the Electron 
Pump operating only on Earth and 
a cosmeg job operating only on 
the Moon, would be ideal— in 
fact, necessary. And if we are to 
operate on the Moon, it would be 
wise, even decent, to take the sensi- 
bilities of the Lunar physicists into 
account. We ought to give them a 
share.” 

Gottstein smiled. “Is this the 
advice of Miss Lindstrom?” 

“I’m sure it would be, but the sug- 
gestion is reasonable enough to have 
occurred to me independently.” 

G ottstein rose, stretched, 
then jumped in place two or 
three times in the eerily slow fash- 



ion imposed by Lunar gravity. He 
flexed his knees each time. He sat 
down again. 

“Ever try that, Dr. Denison?” 
Denison shook his head. 

“It’s supposed to help the circu- 
lation in the lower extremities. 1 do 
it whenever I feel my legs may be 
going to sleep. I’ll be heading back 
for a short visit to Earth before 
long and I’m trying to keep from 
getting too used to Lunar gravity. 
Shall we talk of Miss Lindstrom, 
Dr. Denison?” 

“What about her?” 

“She is a tourist guide.” 

“Yes. You said so earlier.” 

“I also said that she is an odd 
assistant for a physicist.” 

“I’m an amateur physicist only — 
and I suppose she is an amateur 
assistant.” 

Gottstein was no longer smiling. 
“Don’t play games. Doctor. I have 
taken the trouble to find out what I 
can about her. Her record is quite 
revealing — or would have been if it 
had occurred to anyone to look at 
it before this. I believe she is an 
Intuitionist.” 

Denison said, “Many of us are. 1 
have no doubt you are an Intuition- 
ist yourself, after a fashion. I cer- 
tainly know that I am, after a 
fashion.” 

“There is a difference. Doctor. 
You are an accomplished scientist 
and I, I hope, am an accomplished 
administrator. Yet, while Miss 
Lindstrom is enough of an Intu- 
itionist to be useful to you in ad- 
vanced theoretical physics, she is, 
in actual fact, a tourist guide.” 
Denison hesitated. “She has little 
formal training. Commissioner. 
Her Intuitionism is at an unusually 



76 



GALAXY 




f,igh level, but it is under little 
conscious control." 

•'Is she the result of the one-time 
genetic engineering program?" 

“I don’t know. I wouldn’t be 
surprised if she were, however." 

“Do you trust her?" 

“In what way? She has helped 
me." 

“Do you know that she is the wife 
of Dr. Barron Neville?” 

"There is an emotional connec- 
tion not a legal one -I believe.” 

“None of the connections here on 
the Moon are w'hat we would call 
legal. The same Neville yoii want 
to invite as third author of the 
paper you are to write?" 

“Yes.” 

“Is that merely a coincidence?” 

“No. Neville was interested in 
my arrival and I believe he asked 
Selene to help me in my work.” 

“Did she tell you this?” 

“She said he was interested in 
me. That was natural enough, I 
suppose.” . 

“Does it occur to you, Dr. Deni- 
son, that she may be working in her 
own interests and in those of Dr, 
Neville?” 

“In what way would their inter- 
ests differ from ours? She has 
helped me without reservation.” 

Gottstein shifted position and 
moved his shoulders as though he 
were going through muscle-pulling 
exercises. He said, “since the 
woman is so close to him. Dr. 
Neville must know she is an Intu- 
itionist. Wouldn’t he use her? Why 
would she remain a tourist guide if 
not to mask her abilities — for a 
purpose?” 

“I understand Dr. Neville fre- 
quently reasons in this fashion. I 



find it difficult to suspect unneces- 
sary conspiracies.” 

“How do you know they are un- 
necessary? When my space-skipper 
was hovering over the Moon’s 
surface Just before the ball of 
radiation formed over your equip- 
ment- 1 was looking down at you. 
You were not at the Pionizer.” 
Denison thought back. “No, 1 
wasn’t. I was looking at the stars — 
rather a tendency of mine.” 

“What was Miss Lindstrom 
doing?” 

“1 didn’t see. She said she 
strengthened the magnetic field and 
the leak finally broke through.” 

“Is it customary for her to ma- 
nipulate the equipment without 
you?” 

“No. But I can understand the 
impulse.” 

“And would there have been 
some sort of an ejection?” 

“I don’t understand you.” 

“I’m not sure 1 understand my- 
self. But I saw a dim sparkle in the 
Earthlight, as though something 
were flying through the air. I don’t 
know what.” 

“I don’t either,” said Denison. 
“You can’t think of anything that 
might naturally have to do with the 
experiment that—” 

“No.” 

“Then what was Miss Lindstrom 
doing?” 

“I still don’t know.” 

For a moment the silence was 
heavy between them. Then the 
Commissioner said, “As 1 see it, 
then, you will try to correct the 
leak instability and will be thinking 
about the preparation of a paper. I 
will get matters into motion at the 
other end and on my forthcoming 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



77 




visit to Earth will make arrange- 
ments to have the paper published, 
and I will alert the government.” 

It was a clear dismissal. Denison 
rose and the Commissioner said 
easily, “And think about Dr. Ne- 
ville and Miss Lindstrom.” 



17 

I T WAS a heavier star of radia- 
tion, a fatter one, a brighter one. 
Denison could feel its warmth on 
his faceplate and backed away. 
There was a distinct X-ray compo- 
nent in the radiation and though 
his shielding should take care of 
that there was no point in placing it 
under a strain. 

“I guess we can’t question it,” 
he muttered. “The leak point is 
stable.” 

“I’m sure of it,” Selene said. 
“Then let’s turn it off and go 
back to the city.” 

They moved slowly and Denison 
felt oddly dispirited. No uncer- 
tainty was left, no excitement. He 
saw no chance of failure from this 
point on. The government was 
interested — more and more what 
came next would be out of his 
hands. 

He said, “I suppose I can begin 
the paper now.” 

“I suppose so.” 

“Have you spoken to Barron 
again?” 

“Yes, I have.” 

“Any difference in his attitude?” 
“None at all. He will not partici- 
pate. Ben — ” 

“Yes?” 

“I really don’t think it’s any use 
talking to him. He will not cooper- 



ate in any project with the Eartb 
government.” 

“But you’ve explained the 
situation?” 

“Completely.” 

“And he still won’t?” 

“He’s asked to see Gottstein, and 
the Commissioner agreed to an 
interview after he returns from his 
Earth visit. We’ll have to wait till . 
then. Maybe Gottstein can have 
some effect on him, but I doubt it.” ' 
“I don’t understand him.” 

“I do,” Selene said softly. 

Denison did not respond directly. 
He shoved the Pionizer and its 
attendant apparatus into their 
rocky shelter and asked, “Ready?” 
“Ready.” 

They slipped into the surface 
entrance at Outlet P-4 in silence 
and Denison climbed down the 
entry ladder. Selene dropped past 
him, braking in quick holds at 
individual rungs. They removed 
their suits in the staging area, 
placed them in lockers. 

“Would you Join me for lunch, 
Selene?” 

“You seem upset. Is something 
wrong?” 

“Reaction, I think. Lunch?” - 

“Yes, of course.” I 

\ 

T hey ate in Selene’s quarters. 

She had insisted, saying, “I 
want to talk to you and I can’t do 
so properly in the cafeteria.” And 
when Denison was chewing slowly ! 
at something that had a faint re - 1 
semblance to peanut-flavored veal, 
she came out with: “Ben, you 
haven’t said a word — and you’ve 
been like this for a week.” 

Denison frowned. 

“No, I haven’t. 



78 



GALAXY 




“Yes, you have.” She looked into 
his eyes with concern. “I’m not sure 
of how good my intuition is outside 
physics— but 1 suppose there’s 
something you don’t want to tell 
me.” 

Denison shrugged. “They’re 
making afuss about all this back on 
Earth. Gottstein has been pulling 
strings as tough as cables in ad- 
vance of his trip back. Dr. Lamont 
is being lionized and they want me 
to return once the paper is written.” 
“To Earth?” 

“Yes. It seems I’m a hero, too.” 
“You should be.” 

“Compete restitution,” Denison 
said thoughtfully, “is what they 
offer. I can get a position in any 
suitable university or government 
agency on Earth.” 

“Isn’t that what you wanted?” 
“It’s what I imagine Lamont 
wants and would enjoy — and will 
certainly get. But 1 don’t want it.” 
“What do you want, then?” 

“I want to stay on the Moon.” 
“Why?” 

“Because it’s the cutting edge of 
humanity and I want to be part of 
that cutting edge. I want to work at 
the establishment of the Cosmeg 
Pump and that will happen only 
here on the Moon. I want to work 
on para-theory with the kind of 
instruments you can dream up and 
handle. I want to be with you, 
Selene. But would you stay with 
me?” 

“1 am as interested in para- 
theory as you are.” 

“But won’t Neville pull you off 
the job now?” 

“Barron pull me off?” she asked 
tightly. “Are you trying to insult 
me, Ben?” 



“Not at all.” 

“Well, then, do I misunderstand 
you? Are you suggesting that I’m 
working with you because Barron 
ordered me to?” 

“Didn’t he?” 

“Yes, he did. But that’s not why 
I’m here. I choose to be here. He 
may think he can order me about 
but he can only do so when his 
orders coincide with my will, as in 
your case they did. I resent his 
thinking he can order me otherwise 
— and I resent your thinking it, 
too.” 

“You two are sex-partners.” 

“We have been, yes, but what 
has that to do with it? By that logic 
I can order him about as easily as 
he me.” 

“Then you can work with me, 
Selene?” 

“Certainly — if I choose to.” 

“But do you choose to?” 

“As of now, yes.” 

Denison smiled. “The chance 
that you might not choose to— or 
might not be able to— has been 
worrying me this past week. I 
dreaded the end of the project if it 
meant the end of my working with 
you. I’m sorry. Selene, 1 don’t 
mean to plague you with the 
sentimental attachment of an old 
Earthie — ” 

“There’s nothing old Earthie 
about your mind, Ben. There 
are attachments other than sexual. 
1 like being with you.” 

Denison’s smile faded, then re- 
turned. “I’m glad for my mind.” 
He looked away, shook his head 
slightly. 

She watched him carefully, al- 
most anxiously. 

Denison faced her again.

“Selene, there’s more than energy 
involved in the cross-Universe 
leaks. I suspect you’ve been think- 
ing about that.’’ 

The moment stretched out pain- 
fully before Selene said, “Oh, 
that — ’’ 

For a while the two stared at 
each other — Denison embarrassed, 
Selene almost furtive.

G OTTSTEIN said, “I haven’t 
got my Moon legs quite, but 
this isn’t anything compared to 
what it cost me to get my Earth 
legs. Denison, you had better not 
dream of returning. You’ll never 
make it.” 

“I have no intention of returning. 
Commissioner,” said Denison. 

“In a way that’s too bad. You 
could be emperor by acclamation. 
As for Hallam — ” 

Denison said wistfully, “I would 
have like to have seen his face, 
but that was a small ambition.” 
“Lamont, of course, is receiving 
lion’s share. He’s on the scene.” 

“I don’t mind that. He deserves 
a good deal. Do you think Neville 
will really join us?” 

“No question. He’s on his way 
at this moment. Listen.” Gott- 
stein’s voice dropped one conspira- 
torial note in pitch. “Before he 
comes — would you like a bar of 
chocolate?” 

“What?” 

“A bar of chocolate. With al- 
monds. 1 have some.” 

Denison’s face, from initial con- 
fusion, came suddently alive with 
comprehension. “Real chocolate?” 
“Yes.” 



“Certain — ” His face hardened. 
“No, Commissioner.” 

“No?” 

“No. If I taste real chocolate- 
then, for the few minutes it’s in 
my mouth I’m going to miss Earth, 
miss everything about it. I can’t 
afford that. I don’t want — Don’t 
even show it to me. Don’t let me 
smell it or see it.” 

Gottstein looked discomfited. 
“You’re right.” He made an 
obvious attempt to change the 
subject. “The excitement on 
Earth is overwhelming. Of course,, 
we made considerable effort to save 
Hallam’s face. He’ll continue to 
hold some position of importance, 
but he’ll have little real say.” 

“He’s getting more consideration 
than he gave others.” 

“It’s not for his sake. You can’t 
smash a personal image that has 
been built to a level of such 
importance — it would reflect on 
science itself. The good name of 
science is more important than 
Hallam.” 

“I disapprove of that in prin- 
ciple.” Denison spoke warmly. 
“&ience must take what blows 
it deserves.” 

“A time and place for — There’s 
Dr. Neville.” 

Gottstein composed his face. 
Denison shifted his chair to face the 
entrance. 

Barron Neville entered solemnly. 
Somehow there was less than ever 
of the Lunar delicacy about his 
figure. He greeted the two curtly, 
sat down and crossed his legs. He 
was clearly waiting for Gottstein 
to speak first. 

The Commissioner said, “I am 
glad to see you. Dr. Neville. Dr. 



80 



GALAXY 




Penison tells me that you refused 
(0 append your name to what I 
iim sure will be a classic paper on 
the Cosmeg Pump.” 

‘‘No need to do so," said 
Neville. “What happens on Earth 
is of no interest to me.” 

“You are aware of the cosmeg ex- 
periments? Of their implications?” 
“1 know the situation as well as 
you two do.” 

“Then I will proceed without 
preliminaries. 1 have returned 
from Earth, Dr. Neville, and it is 
quite settled as to what will be the 
course of future procedure. Large 
cosmeg-pumping stations will be 
set up on three different places on 
the Lunar surface in such a way 
that one will always be in the 
night-shadow. Half the time, two 
will be. Those in the night-shadow 
will be constantly generating 
energy, most of which will simply 
radiate into space. The purpose 
will be not so much to use the 
energy for practical purposes as to 
counteract the changes in field 
intensities introduced by the Elec- 
tron Pump.” 

Denison interrupted. “For some 
years we will have to overbalance 
the Electron Pump to restore our 
section of the Universe to the 
point at which it was before the 
Pump began operation.” 

Neville nodded. “Will Luna City 
have the use of any of it?” 

“If necessary. We feel the solar 
batteries will probably supply what 
you need, but there is no objection 
to supplementation.” 

“That is kind of you,” said 
Neville, not bothering to mask 
his sarcasm. “And who will build 
and run the Cosmeg Pumps?” 



“Lunar workers, we hope,” said 
Gottstein. 

“Lunar workers you must have,” 
said Neville. “Earth workers 
would be too clumsy to work ef- 
fectively on the Moon.” 

“We recognize that,” said Gott- 
stein. “We trust the men of the 
Moon will cooperate.” 

“And who will decide how 
much energy to generate, how 
much to apply for any local pur- 
pose, how much to radiate away? 
Who decides policy?” 

Gottstein said, “The government 
would have to. It’s a matter of 
planetary decision.” 

Neville said, “You see? It will be 
the Moonmen who do the work — 
Earthmen who run the show.” 
Gottstein said calmly. “No. All 
of us work who work best. All 
of us administer who can best 
weigh the total problem.” 

“1 hear the words,” said Neville, 
“but it boils down anyway to us 
working and you deciding. No, 
Commissioner. The answer is no.” 
“You mean you won’t build the 
pumps?” 

“We’ll build them. Commis- 
sioner, but they’ll be ours. We’ll 
decide how much energy to put 
out and what use to make of it.” 
“That would scarcely be ef- 
ficient. You would have to deal 
constantly with the Earth govern- 
ment since the Cosmeg stations 
will have to balance the Electron 
stations.” 

“We have other things in mind. 
You might as well know now. 
Energy is not the only conserved 
phenomenon that becomes limit- 
less once universes are crossed.” 
Denison interrupted. “There 



the gods THEMSELVES 



81 




are a number of conservation laws. 
We realize that.” 

“I’m glad you do,” said Neville, 
turning a hostile glare in his 
direction. “They include those of 
linear momentum and angular 
momentum. As long as any object 
responds to the gravitational field 
in which it is immersed — and to 
that only— it is in free fall and 
can retain its mass. In order to 
move in any other way then free 
fall, it must accelerate in a non- 
gravitational way and for that to 
happen, part of itself must undergo 
an opposite change.” 

“As in a rocket ship,” said 
Denison, “which must eject mass 
in one direction in order that the 
rest might accelerate in the op- 
posite direction.” 

“I’m sure you understand. Dr. 
Denison,” said Neville, “but I 
explain for the Commissioner’s 
sake. The loss of mass can be 
minimized if velocity is increased 
enormously, since momentum is 
equal to mass multiplied by 
velocity. Nevertheless, however 
great the velocity, some mass must 
be thrown away. If the mass that 
must be accelerated is enormous in 
the first place, then the mass that 
must be discarded is also enormous. 
If the Moon, for instance — ” 

“The Moon?” said Gottstein 
with energy. 

“Yes, the Moon.” Neville re- 
mained calm. “If the Moon were 
to be driven out of its orbit and 
sent out of the solar system, the 
conservation of momentum 
would make it a colossal under- 
taking and probably a thoroughly 
impractical one. If, however, 
momentum could be transferred to 



the cosmeg in another Universe, 
the Moon could accelerate at any 
convenient rate without loss of 
mass at all. It would be like poling 
a barge upstream, to give you a 
picture I obtained from some 
Earth book I once read.” 

“But why? 1 mean, why should 
you want to move the Moon?” 

“I should think that would be 
obvious. Why do we need the 
suffocating presence of the Earth? 
We have the energy we need. 
We have a comfortable world 
through which we have room to ex- 
pand for the next few centuries at 
least. Why should we not go our 
own way? In any case — we will. I 
have come to tell you that you can- 
not stop us and to urge you to 
make no attempt to interfere. We 
shall transfer momentum and we 
shall pull out. We of the Moon 
know precisely how to go about 
building the Cosmeg Pump. We’ll 
use what energy we need for 
ourselves and produce excess in 
order to neutralize the changes 
your own power stations are 
producing.” 

Denison said sardonically, “It 
sounds kind of you to produce 
excess for our sake, but it isn’t for 
our sake, of course. If our Elec- 
tron Pumps explode the sun — that 
will happen long before you can 
move out of the inner solar 
system and you will vaporize 
wherever you are.” 

“Perhaps,” said Neville. “But 
in any case we are going to 
produce an excess, so that won’t 
happen.” 

“But you can’t do that,” said 
Gottstein excitedly. “You can’t 
move out. If you get out too far.

the Cosmeg Pump will no longer 
neutralize Earth’s Electron Pump. 
Eh, Denison?” 

Denison shrugged. “Once they 
are as far off as Saturn, more or 
less, there may be trouble, if I may 
trust a mental calculation 1 have 
just made. It will, however, be 
many years before they receded to 
such a distance and by that time, we 
will surely have constructed space 
platforms in what was once the 
orbit of the Moon and placed 
cosmeg pumping stations on 
them. Actually, we don’t need the 
Moon. They can leave — except that 
they won’t.” 

Neville smiled briefly. “What 
makes you think we won’t? We 
can’t be stopped. There is no way 
Earthmen can impose their will on 
us.” 

“You won’t leave because there’s 
no sense in doing so. Why drag the 
entire Moon away? To build up 
respectable accelerations will take 
years. You’ll creep. Build starships 
instead — miles-long ships that are 
cosmeg-powered and have indepen- 
dent ecologies. With a cosmeg 
momentum-drive, you could then 
do wonders. If it takes twenty 
years to build the ships, they will 
nevertheless accelerate at a rate 
that would enable them to overtake 
the Moon within a year — even if 
the Moon could start accelerating 
today. And the ships will be able to 
change course in a tiny fraction of 
the time the Moon would need.” 

“And the unbalanced cosmeg- 
pumping? What will that do to the 
Universe?” 

“The energy required by a ship, 
or even by a fleet, will be far less 
than that required by a planet and 



will be distributed throughout 
large sections of the Universe. It 
will be millions of years before any 
significant change takes place. And 
think of the maneuverability you 
gain! The Moon will move so 
slowly it might as well be left in 
place.” 

Neville said scornfully, “We’re 
in no hurry to get anywhere — 
except away from Earth.” 

Denison said, “There are advan- 
tages in having Earth as neighbor. 
You have the influx of the Immi- 
grants. You have cultural inter- 
course. You have a planetary world 
of two billion people just over the 
horizon. Do you want to give up 
all that?” 

“Gladly.” 

“Is that true of the people of the 
Moon generally? Or just of you? 
There’s something intense about 
you, Neville. You won’t go out on 
the surface. Other Lunarites do. 
They don’t like it particularly, but 
they go. The interior of the Moon 
isn’t their womb, as it is yours. It 
isn’t their prison, as it is yours. 
There is a neurotic factor in you 
that is absent in most Lunarites— 
or at least considerably weaker. 
If you take the Moon away from 
Earth, you make it into a prison 
for all. It will become a one-world 
prison from which no man — and 
not you only — can emerge, not even 
to the extent of seeing another 
inhabited world in the sky. Perhaps 
that is what you want.” 

“I want independence — a free 
world, a world untouched by the 
outside.” 

“You can build ships in any 
number. You can move outward at 
near-light velocities without diffi-

culty once you tranfer momentum 
to the cosmeg. You can explore the 
entire Universe in a single lifetime. 
Wouldn’t you like to get on such a 
ship?” 

“No,” said Neville with clear 
distaste. 

“Wouldn’t you? Or — couldn’t 
you? Must you take the Moon with 
you wherever you go? Why must all 
the others accept your need?” 
“Because that’s the way it’s going 
to be,” said Neville. 

Denison’s voice remained level 
but his cheeks reddened. “Who 
gave you the right to say that? 
There are many citizens of Luna 
City who may not feel as you do.” 
“That is none of your concern.” 
“That is precisely my concern. 
I am an immigrant who will qualify 
for citizenship soon. I do not wish 
to have my choice made for me by 
someone who cannot emerge on the 
surface and who wants his personal 
prison made into a prison for all. 1 
have left Earth forever, but only to 
come to the Moon, only to remain a 
quarter-million miles from the 
home planet. I have not contracted 
to be taken forever away for an 
unlimited distance.” 

“Then return to Earth,” said 
Neville indifferently. “There is still 
time.” 

“And what of the other citizens 
of Luna? The other immigrants?” 
“The decision is made.” 

“It is not made. Selene!” 

Selene entered, her face solemn, 
her eyes a little defiant. Neville’s 
legs uncrossed. Both shoes came 
down Hat on the floor. 

Neville asked, “How long have 
you been waiting in the next room, 
Selene?” 



“Since before you arrived, 
Barron.” 

Neville looked from Selene to 
Denison and back again. “You 
two — ” he began, finger pointing 
from one to the other and back. 

“1 don’t know what you mean by 
‘you two,’ ” said Selene, “but Ben 
found out about the momentum 
quite a while ago.” 

“It wasn’t Selene’s fault,” said 
Denison. “The Commissioner 
spotted something flying at a time 
when no one could possibly have 
known he would be observing. It 
seemed to me that Selene might be 
testing something I was not think- 
ing of and transfer of momentum 
eventually occurred to me. After 
that — ” 

“Well, then, you knew,” said 
Neville. “It doesn’t matter.” 

“It does, Barron,” said Selene. 
“I talked about it with Ben. I found 
that I didn’t always have to accept 
what you said. Perhaps I can’t ever 
go to Earth. Perhaps 1 don’t even 
want to. But I found I liked Earth 
in my sky where I could see it if I 
wanted to. I didn’t want an empty 
sky. Then I talked to others of the 
Group. Not everybody wants to 
leave. Most would rather build 
ships and let those go who wish to 
go while allowing those to remain 
behind who wish to remain.” 

Neville’s breath was coming 
hard. “You talked about it? Who 
gave you the right to — ” 

“1 took the right, Barron. Besides, 
it doesn’t matter any more. You’ll 
be outvoted.” 

“Because of — ” Neville rose to 
his feet and took a menacing step 
toward Denison. 

The Commissioner said, “Please

don’t get emotional. Dr. Neville. 
You may be of Luna, but I don’t 
think you can manhandle both of 
us.” 

“Alt three,” said Selene, “and 
I’m of Luna, too. I did it, Barron - 
not they.” 

Denison said, “Look, Neville — 
for all Earth cares, the Moon can 
go. Earth can build its space 
stations. It’s the citizens of Luna 
City who care. Selene cares and I 
care and the rest. You are not being

VERY window in Selene’s 
apartment now had a view of 
Earth. She said, “The vote did go 
against him, you know, Ben. Quite 
heavily.” 

“I doubt that he’ll give up, 
though. And if there’s friction with 
Earth during the building of the 
stations, public opinion on the 
Moon may swing back.” 

“There needn’t be friction.” 

“No, there needn’t. In any case, 
there are no happy endings in 
history, only crisis points that pass. 
This one has passed — or has been 
passed— safely, I think, and we’ll 
worry about the others as they 
come and as they can be foreseen. 
Once the starships are built, the 
tension will surely subside 
considerably.” 



“We’ll live to see that, I’m sure.” 
“You will, Selene.” 

“You, too, Ben. Don’t over- 
dramatize your age. You’re only 
forty-eight.” 

“Would you go on one of the 
starships, Selene?” 

“No. I’d be too old and I still 
wouldn’t want to lose Earth in the 
sky. My son might go. Ben?” 

“Yes, Selene.” 

“I have applied for a second son. 
The application has been accepted. 
Would you contribute?” 

Denison’s eyes lifted and looked 
straight into hers. 

“Artificial insemination?” 

Selene said defensively, “That’s 
just good sense, Ben. It’s important 
to have good gene combinations. 
There’s nothing wrong with some 
natural genetic engineering.” 
“None at all.” 

“It doesn’t mean that I don’t 
want it for other reasons, too.” 
Denison nodded and remained 
silent. 

Selene said almost angrily, 
“Well, there’s more to love than 
sex.” 

Denison said, “I agree with that. 
At least — 1 love you even with sex 
subtracted.” 

And Selene said, “And for that 
matter, there’s more to sex than 
acrobatics.” 

Denison said, “1 agree with that, 
too.” 

And Selene said, “And besides — 
Oh, damn it, you could try to 
learn.” 

Denison said softly, “If you 
would try to teach.” 

Hesitantly he moved toward her. 
She did not move away. 

He stopped hesitating. * 




THE GODS THEMSELVES

B ROCAAL was a geologically 
young planet and the salt ma- 
chines were a state monopoly. You 
put a penny into the slot and it 
rolled inside to strike a gong. The 
licensee came to inspect the coin 
and pull the lever that released a 
capsule down the chute. 

Eight-year-old Robbie Hassel- 
dorf was sent as usual for the 
supper salt. There was a flurry of 
morality when he returned with his 
reticule filled with capsules. Failure 
of the trigger mechanism was not 
unknown, but it was difficult to 
determine whether the salt machine 
was a function of the state or the 
temple. 

“Did anyone see you?” Robbie 
shook his head. His mother sniffed 
piously. “A gift from heaven.” 

His father was doubtful. “Salt 
maintains the temple. The state is 
built on salt.” He was master 
gooseherd of the northern watches 
and sensitive to practical politics. 

“The machines illuminate the 
Eleventh Platitude,” said Robbie’s 
brother in a hollow voice. He was 
marked for a religious career. 
“ ‘There is a price for living and a 
price for dying — ’ ” he quoted the 
whole long verse and finished, 
“ ‘ — nothing under the stars is 
free.’ ” He slipped a few capsules 
into his reticule while the family 
listened with closed eyes. Robbie 
peeked between his fingers. “Let 
us give thanks,” said his brother 
and took one more. 

Robbie’s older sister thought 



they should return the capsules to 
the neighborhood temple — well, 
some of them — and his younger 
sister broke one open and licked it 
up behind her veil with a beatific 
narrowing of her eyes. No one 
asked Robbie’s opinion, but the 
Hasseldorf family did not buy salt 
for several holy days. 

When he was sent for salt again 
the miracle recurred. 

The Hasseldorfs were obviously 
in a state of grace. A well-developed 
sense of piety precluded any an- 
nouncement of this condition. 
Robbie’s father prepaid a series of 
prayers and acquired a new gander 
from the master gooseherd of the 
north-northeastern watches. His 
mother was inspired to try a new 
and difficult chausable pattern she 
called the Star of Brocaal. His 
brother bought a royal blue veil 
from the worm-spinners, his older 
sister righteously planted twenty- 
two mulberries and his younger 
sister began to. grow fat. 

Once he had watched state me- 
chanics disassemble the salt 
machine. They told him to beat it, 
so he borrowed his brother’s old 
green veil and was chased away 
again. He took mincing steps, 
wearing his older sister’s orange 
veil — the one she had lost — and in 
three lingering periods of obser- 
vation decided folks received only 
so many capsules from heaven 
because they lodged in the hopper. 
He concluded that a long and 
limber length of plastic should

solve that theological problem. 

Hence Robbie's current mira- 
culous hauls . 

He was a quiet boy who noticed 
that those who raised their heads 
above the crowd tended to get their 
heads hit. 

He shouted with the others at 
school, “Earth is foul. Earth is 
corrupt!” 

The next section yelled, “The 
chosen flew on wings of grace!” 

The third section shrilled, “In a 
box of iron through the dark of 
space!” 

The schoolmaster bellowed, 
“God left Earth with us, the people 
of his choice!” 

The whole school rocked: “Shout 
our grace! Ring the bell! Brocaal 
is fjeaven. Earth is Hell!” 

He had been stimulated by the 
sacred lessons when he’d begun 
school. The damned Earthers rolled 
their eyes and howled. They ex- 
posed their mouths and lower limbs 
and waved their arms. They had no 
shame. They sold their souls for 
demon-driven carts and wagons. 
The wagon tongues lashed the air 
and the carts rolled about madly 
with no man to push them. It was a 
vision of horror and chaos. Later 
revelations were less exciting. The 
space flight, the sowing of the good 
soil, the movement of the moon 
into the sky, the years of heavenly 
sleep, the building of Harmonious 
City with its sixteen spokes radi- 
ating from the central temple, all 
this was endlessly repeated until 



the slowest child was sodden with 
tedium. 



I T WAS a lean diet. Robbie’s 
mind was starved. He had been 
in a state of near acceptance when 
his mother first had sent him for the 
salt. Then he had learned to disas- 
sociate his mind from his mouth. 

He yelled with his peers, but 
he wondered why God did not build 
a salt machine with a zig-zag chute. 
He speculated why God dispersed 
holy gruel from the temples before 
dawn and before sunset every day. 
Why could not God arrange a meal 
in the middle of the day? 

He did not suggest this to his 
teacher or to the Speakers. The 
latitude allowed young creatures as 
they are molded to the adult form 
left no room for such questions. He 
was careful and he was not stulti- 
fied. His eager mind was kept alive 
by the salt machines. 

After the two miraculous gifts 
from heaven Robbie took the coin 
his mother gave him and very 
properly put it into the slot. He did 
this because a peephole had been 
drilled in the wall of the machine. 
The hopper had been altered 
somewhat, too. 

Then his brother became an 
agricultural acolyte and left home 
to work and pray in the food fields 
south of the city. Robbie had the 
attic to himself. The Hasseldorf 
family was blessed by children. The 
usual unsanctified family raised one

GALAXY 




or two and the row houses were 
built with this in mind —until his 
brother left, the boys had shared 
the cramped loft. With sole pos- 
session of the attic Robbie secured 
the rarest thing in Harmonious — a 
secret hiding place. He found a 
loosely glued floorboard. The loft 
window opened to the shed roof. 
He was free during the hours of 
darkness to continue his private 
education. A longer and more 
limber plastic worked well indeed 
even in the altered salt machines 

By the time he was ten, the 
authorities were seriously disturbed 
by the thefts. Where every man 
was his brother’s ardent keeper, 
deviation should have been obvious. 
Yet the stolen salt simply vanished. 
Consumption records were exam- 
ined and there was no major loss 
of sales in any area. Human factors 
compounded the problem. 

On the night the rogue was nearly 
caught the special watchman’s feet 
rolled out from under him on 
quickly scattered capsules. He 
thumped his head severely. He 
described the thief as a monster 
abetted by two large helpers. All 
men over five feet two inches tall 
were questioned. Fortunately for 
the watchman a Speaker had 
found him, because there were no 
capsules on the ground by the time 
the crime was investigated. The 
drop-off in local sales indicted the 
entire neighborhood and Robbie’s 
school was honored to power the 
whipping machine. 



Four boys buttoned their smocks 
between their legs and climbed as 
fast as they could in the open-sided, 
fifteen-foot squirrel cage. A shaft 
turned clanking peg gears that 
transmitted power to the four 
stations. The criminal was bound 
to a whipping block and the drums 
beat as flails were lowered to his 
back. Each criminal faced a point 
of the compass, so the population 
had a good view. In whippings of 
this nature, the flails were wide 
and administered a stinging slap. 
Four more boys for power, four 
more men, women or children to 
howl. The drums growled and 
throbbed. It was a stimulating day 
for everyone. 

A spirit of larceny awoke in the 
hearts of some licensees and spo- 
radic petty thievery added to the 
confusion. Robbie also had good 
luck. One dewy night he visited the 
south-southwest spoke and was 
returning home when he broke open 
a capsule and was surprised to find 
the white crystals turned dark in 
the damp air. After some thought 
he distributed the salt on doorsteps 
in the south-southeast spoke. The 
blue lips in that neighborhood 
puzzled the authorities. The telltale 
chemical added to the salt obviously 
had tattled on the wrong people. 

Robbie did not feel altogether 
depraved because his tongue did 
not turn black from omission of 
the truth. He was the victim of his 
own inquiring mind, which was not 
his fault. He succumbed to temp- 



ROBBIE and DAVID AND LITTLE DAHL

tation, but he paid for his trans- 
gressions with periods of depression 
when the universal apathy seemed 
almost enviable. 

His mother’s widely admired 
needlework showed him a possible 
life within the bounds of society. 
His father was a devoted student of 
geese. But despite good examples 
and good resolutions, boredom 
drove Robbie to greater risks and 
he often drowsed in school. When, 
at the age of twelve, he completed 
his education, he was ordered to 
work and pray at the salt pans 
north of the city. 

He was assigned to the master 
lock builder, an opinionated old 
craftsman who had his shop and 
chapel at the upper end of the pans, 
away from the main enclave. 
Robbie Hasseldorf began to see 
some sort of tolerable future for 
himself in mitre and spline, dove- 
tail, mortise and tenon and all 
the delightful intricacies the old 
man insisted on for even the most 
temporary plastic constructions. 

E arly one morning just before 
his fourteenth birthday, when 
the sun was so low the checker- 
board of salt ponds was all in 
shadow, Robbie was returning to 
the shop with his apprentice tools. 
He had been called in the middle of 
the night to correct the stupidity of 
a zanjero who had broken a gate by 
beating it in sideways. 

A shadow bobbed behind him. It 
was cast by a beanpole Speaker 



striding along the dike. He was 
mumbling to himself: “ — heaviness 
of guilt and the weight of sanctity — 
boy! Where dwells the apprentice 
Hasseldorf?” 

“He works and prays at the lock 
builder’s shop, sir,” said Robbie 
with correct formality. “But — uh — 
he is not there now.” 

“Guide me thereunto. I will 
speak with his master, exorcise his 
pallet and wait the sinner’s return.” 
“Is it permitted to know his sin, 
sir?” 

“The world knows his trans- 
gression. Why should you not? His 
name is infamy. What is your 
name, boy?” 

“David — David Devout, sir.” 
“David, this nefarious Hasseldorf 
stole salt. His parents and siblings 
prove innocent under interrogation. 
They will live.” 

David was shocked. “How is such 
a thing possible?” he croaked. 

“Well may you ask! My colleague 
in investigation was stout in the 
Lord, David. May I be forgiven for 
doubting the purposes of the 
Almighty! His weight, in addition 
to that of the hidden capsules, 
collapsed the ceiling of the Hassel- 
dorf dwelling. Down he fell, along 
with hundreds and hundreds of 
salt capsules.” 

“Was he hurt, sir?” 

“His neck snapped and his spirit 
flew. The devil Hasseldorf will be 
grated. He will be macerated and 
returned to the soil in a spirit of 
repentence! Thus he will serve man- 



90 



GALAXY 




kind. He will grow hard cabbages 
or perhaps fat rutabagas." The 
Speaker smacked his lips and con- 
tinued his scissors walk, David 
Devout, formerly Robbie Hassel- 
dorf, trotting along behind. 

The shop was empty. The master 
craftsman was installing a rood 
screen in the salt temple. The other 
craftsmen and apprentices had 
carried it there before dawn. David 
could not offer the Speaker holy 
gruel as refreshment because no 
one had brought food from the 
temple. The devil Hasseldorf had 
secretly experimented with the 
gruel and found it possible to bake 
it into cakes. They were black but 
durable. The gruel itself would not 
keep sweet longer than two days. 
David did not think it necessary to 
show the Speaker this experiment. 
Instead he helped him burn another 
apprentice’s pallet. Then he caught 
the man’s interest with the newest 
type of stock ordered by the central 
temple. 

It was built as a hollow cube, 
X-braced on the sides with a neck 
retainer in the center of the top. 
The sinner could neither sit nor lie 
with this contrivance about him. 
Whether he could rest his chin 
depended on whether the collar 
was spiked or not. The prototype 
was not spiked. 

"My master has been longing for 
someone of your magnificent size, 
sir, to understand if one model will 
suit all sinners,” David said. 

“Forward the work of the 



temple." said the Speaker. David 
helped him adjust the neck retainer 
and gave a twist to the simple latch 
on a corner, well away from the 
sinner’s reach. He put the black 
gruel cakes into his tool kit. He 
said a polite goodbye. 



F ortunately the wind was 

from the sea, blowing to the 
barren hills. David could hear 
appeals to the Almighty for a 
considerable distance. It took a 
surprising time for them to alert 
the nearest harvesting workers-- 
a good half-mile upwind, raking 
salt from the last concentration 
pan and shoveling it into a cart. 
David walked briskly to the far 
dike, the long mound of earth 
that walled the river in spate away 
from the salt pans. He turned for 
a last look at the known world. 
The flat land ran to the dim city, 
with only rocky Mt. Cluke inter- 
rupting the long blue line of the 
sea. The crew was running toward 
him. He could hear them shouting. 
He turned to the hills and began 
trotting. Robbie Hasseldorf had 
observed debris in the river, 
branches of trees similar to, but 
larger than mulberries. Once he 
had seen a chip boat in the mud. 
He thought the chip had come 
downstream from the hands of 
some unknown boy. David was 
going to find out. 

Brocaal was enlivened differently 
from most planets. Xenoecologists

proceed with a reverential sense 
of mission. They take forever to 
compatibilize the permutations 
of a thousand factors to a point 
where no obvious disaster can 
be held against them. Contractors 
supply the sterile soil, pure strains 
of bacteria and fungi, the required 
birds and beasts and bugs, the 
enormous variety of seeds, roots 
and cuttings, the diatoms, plankton 
and the rest of the marine ecology 
to proper temperature and salinity 
requirements. This takes a long 
time and a lot of money. It is — 
and was — standard procedure. 

But the temple on Earth had 
faith, folks, an elderly starship 
and 160 acres of bottomland 
near Cuppyville, Alabama. They 
had scooped off the rich topsoil. 
They had bought their ocean 
biology at a bankruptcy sale, had 
ordered everything in the Burpee 
catalog, had got four lots of trees 
at a bargain, had bought animals 
at a wholesale auction and lifted 
for the stars with four thousand 
eight hundred and thirty-five of the 
faithful stasised in cardboard 
boxes. They had located Brocaal 
and seeded it, towed over a plane- 
toid for a moon and put it into 
stable orbit thirty-four thousand 
miles from the surface. A moon 
makes tides and tides are necessary 
in turn a lifeless world into a livable 
world. They had planted seeds and 
trees at the proper time. They had 
set up standard alarms, settled into 
naps. They had slept on for maybe 



two hundred years — the recording 
clock failed — and the other seeded 
locations had been forgotten in the 
establishment of Harmonious 
City. 

David knew nothing of all that. 
He trotted now because he had a 
good lead on his front-running 
pursuer. It was the beanpole 
Speaker in the hollow cube. The 
Speaker held the cage off his 
shoulders by lifting the X-members. 
David headed for the hills because 
he feared them and thought others 
might be as uncomfortable as he 
was on the irregular ground. After 
a while he ran, because the man 
was gaining on him. 

AT THE first crest David stopped 
X\. to ease the pain in his side. 
The men with rakes and shovels 
were now walking. The man in the 
box was fanatic. He was halfway 
up the hill. David caught his second 
wind and flew down the long sandy 
slope and up the next rise. The 
Speaker closed the distance. The 
next valley had a watercourse in 
it, thick with the tallest grass 
David had ever seen. Gasping and 
sobbing for breath, he forced his 
way through and fell chest deep 
into water. He sank to the ground 
on the far side. He fumbled through 
his tool kit. There was nothing to 
help him. What good was a flaring 
tool? The melding glue? The pipe 
cutter? The molding planes? The 
wobble-wheel knife? 

The cubed man burst through the

bamboo on the far side. David was 
frantically cutting a stalk of the 
tall grass. The Speaker howled 
unintelligibly and splashed into 
the water. David thrust the stick 
between his legs and Nemesis fell. 
The man panted and gibbered while 
David cut more bamboo. By the 
time the cubed man could speak 
clearly he looked like a hurrah’s 
nest, with bamboo every which 
way. 

The promises the Speaker made 
loudly would have used up a school 
of boys. He had a hot imagination. 
Perhaps it would have taken two 
schools to serve the things he had 
in mind. David did what seemed 
reasonable with such a person. 
Then he stumbled wearily over to 
the big river and walked upstream. 

He ate four of the black cakes 
the first day. He had little concept 
of distance. The salt pans were a 
two-hour walk from the city and 
that was far. On the second day 
he ate the other two cakes. Then 
he got hungrier and found starva- 
tion hurt. Like any boy, Robbie 
Hasseldorf had eaten mulberry 
leaves and a few silk worms. The 
sativa stank too bad to eat. He 
had never seen the food farm 
south of the city. When the infant 
supplement had no longer been 
issued he had been fed the standard 
gruel. It was different every day, 
a mixture of cooked and fresh 
foods, sometimes dry, sometimes 
juicy. It never contained entire 
ingredients. 



He tried grass and chucked it 
up. He observed birds and tried 
their diet. The seeds were tiny and 
the insects nasty. He had little 
understanding of basic life-support 
systems. Education in Harmonious 
was designed to this end. With no 
options available, the Right Way 
was the only way for the populace. 
Even a restricted life was prefer- 
able to the only known alternative. 

When the planet Bocaal first 
had been seeded with animal life, 
coyotes and raccoons had been 
selected as predators. They were 
adaptable beasts and balanced 
insects and rabbits and birds 
and frogs — with definite ecologi- 
cal functions— and the coyotes 
naturally selected injured or weak 
cattle and sheep. David slumped 
under a tree and watched a coyote 
kill a rabbit and begin to eat it. 
He yelled and startled the beast 
away. He tried to eat the rabbit 
himself and got a mouthful of fur. 
He was down to a hundred and 
some pounds and staggering when 
he blundered through a field of 
corn and found a path. 

I T LED to a human construc- 
tion he did not recognize as a 
house. A man came around a 
corner. He wore tubes of material 
on his arms and legs. He had no 
beard. David knew he was a man 
because of his voice. 

“Hey, Molly! We win a coup — 
that twenty-year-old keg of 
brandy!” 



Robbie and david and little dahl

A woman joined him. She wore 
no veil. Her nether tubes showed 
the shape of her hips. “Looks like 
we better clean it up and feed it. 
Do you suppose it’s a boy or a 
girl? What’s your name, kid?’’ 

He looked at her and blushed. 
“Dahlton Bradley.” He wondered 
if his tongue were black, but 
Robbie and David had been hard 
luck. 

“Little Dahl,” said the man. 
“Well, you’re a most particular 
mess. When did you eat last?” 
“Don’t know, sir.” The woman’s 
upper garment showed her shape. 
Little Dahl stared at the ground. 
It moved under him. 

“Don’t call me sir. I’m Ed Wad- 
dell. Molly, this poor little lad 
needs a drink first thing.” 

The woman went into the shiny 
structure and brought out a bottle 
and glass. Waddell splashed it half 
full. Little Dahl surrendered him- 
self to the intentions of these 
people and drank the contents. 

The woman said, “I’m Molly 
Wye — take it easy, boy.” 

He did not hear her. The liquid 
clawed down his throat and ex- 
ploded in his stomach. He wheezed 
for breath. His eyes went wide and 
began to run water. He sneezed 
rapidly, each sneeze louder than 
the last. His body shook and so 
did theirs. He saw this through 
a mist of tears. He was not ac- 
customed to laughter but he 
smiled weakly when he was fairly 
sure he was going to live. 



They gave him a bowl of some- 
thing called stew. It was a very little 
portion. He was disappointed but 
did not complain. The man led him 
to a rectangular sheet with poles 
tied at either end. The poles were 
tied to trees. Waddell picked him 
up and put him in the middle, paral- 
lel with the poles. The trees spun 
around him, though when he 
opened his eyes he saw this was 
not true. When he opened his eyes 
again the sun was at the other side 
of the sky. 

This time the bowl of stew was 
large. It was filled with unfamiliar 
things in large pieces. It was the 
best food Little Dahl had ever had. 
Robbie and David never tasted 
anything so good. Ed Waddell and 
Molly Wye watched him eat. They 
did not speak because he would 
put down his spoon with trembling 
fingers, fold his hands in his lap 
and wait for permission to begin 
again. 

When he had licked the bowl 
clean as all proper people do he 
said, “Thank you. Your temple 
must be close by. 1 never had such 
good gruel.” 

“Temple, hell! That’s beef stew, 
boy. You mean to say it’s true 
they feed you slop like we heard?” 
Little Dahl haltingly explained the 
city food system, to their disgusted 
amazement. “No wonder you got 
the punies, kid,” said Waddell. 

“He’s got years of eating to catch 
up on,” said Molly. “How old are 
you, Little Dahl?”

GALAXY 




“Fourteen,” he said and won- 
dered drowsily where he had been 
on his birthday. There would be no 
new smock for him that year— or 
any other year. As it turned out, 
Molly Wye cut down a pair of her 
own pants and a shirt to fit him. 

H e WORKED— but did not 
pray much — for two months 
on the farthest downriver clearing 
of the Haven people. His training 
in obedience made it possible for 
him to withstand an unending 
series of shocks. The food was a 
constant surprise. The metal house 
was a bewilderment. The variety 
of skills casually exhibited by the 
two seemed impossible. The music 
Molly played on a guitar opened 
entire realms of wonder. The 
simple uses of wood amazed him 
as much as the dependence on 
plastics in Harmonious amazed 
Ed and Molly. 

The difference that set every 
familiar pattern askew, the differ- 
ence that made life a rushing 
stream instead of a salt pan, the 
bittersweet difference that tilted 
Little Dahl from his foundations 
was laughter. He knew about 
laughing, all right — the short bark 
when the teacher stepped back 
off the platform and jarred his 
spine, the covert snickering when 
the wind raised a smock above a 
woman’s ankles, the uneasy titter 
when others were whipped — he 
understood those. Ed and Molly 



laughed, though, for sheer joy. 

How they laughed when he told 
them about the Speaker in the 
cube. Their eyes were bright when 
he said the man must have nudged 
open the bolt on the double doors 
of the lock shop. And they were 
uproarious when he described how 
he pulled the bamboo from around 
the Speaker’s legs and made a 
total hurrah’s nest around his 
shoulders. He had pushed the 
bundle into the stream and it had 
floated off, bald head sticking 
above the greenery like a red 
goose-egg cursing in a nest. 

Little Dahl learned to laugh 
with them, though it came hard at 
first. And he worked until he was 
told to stop. He even came to 
some terms with his naked body 
and learned to paddle in the river. 
He could bait hooks on the trot- 
line and eat fish. The days were 
not long enough for all the new 
things he had to think about. 

When the ears were stiff and dry, 
Ed started up the house and floated 
it above ground over to the corn- 
patch. He taught Little Dahl how 
to shuck corn and throw it into the 
powered trailer. Little Dahl did 
not laugh. He was somber and 
fearful. 

Molly noticed his disquiet and 
the last of the corn-shucking days 
were devoted to an explanation 
of the principle of anti-gravity — 
how the sunpower conversion unit 
triggered the energy helix of the 
magnetic loom to weave power

strips. He understood very little 
of what they said, but he lost his 
fear and dreamed no more of grop- 
ing hands and wagon tongues in 
the sky. That usage made for good 
or ill was another of a hundred 
new ideas. 

Ed and Molly were pleasant 
youngsters in the first summer of 
their first marriage and found 
Little Dahl a useful third party in, 
their exploration of each other. 
They were almost as sorry as he 
when the harvest was completed 
and they began the long journey 
up the river to Haven The trailer 
was overflowing and the house was 
half-filled with corn. The weight 
was too great, they solemnly told 
each other, to lift over the tree- 
tops on the most direct route. They 
rigged paddlewheels, lowered a keel 
and rudder into the water, and fol- 
lowed the meanderings of the river 
for a last delightful week. They 
ran eight hundred slow miles before 
they turned into a tributary, fol- 
lowed it to the lake and brought 
home their harvest and Little Dahl. 



H aven was inside a wide 
loop road running from the 
lake and circling back to the lake. 
It was filled with tree-hidden 
houses. Ed and Molly retracted 
the keel and rudder, lifted ashore 
and folded the paddles. From the 
gazebo, the glassed-in pilot house 
on the roof, Little Dahl watched the 
traffic from wide eyes. The other 



houses were in the air, guided by 
directional vents. Ed said it was a 
question of power available for 
constant use. He and Molly lifted 
in the same fashion and delivered 
the corn to storage halfway around 
the road. They towed the house 
to their residential pad inside the 
loop with a common-use ground 
car. 

Ed said it was time to collect the 
brandy for the coup. Little Dahl 
knew about this. The governance 
board of Haven had a standing 
offer for the delivery of any 
Harmonious resident in reasonably 
good condition. The prestige of the 
coup and the old brandy were 
enormous. “And you got to go 
somewhere,” said Molly sadly. 
They drove the ground car to the i 
governance building on the lake- I 
front. 

Tad Michels welcomed them 
and they trooped over to the audi- ' 
torium where a handsomely finished 
keg was on display. Molly liked the 
gold plaque even better. Jolly Ed 
shook Little Dahl’s hand and 
sprightly Molly brushed a kiss 
on his mouth. It was the first one 
he had ever had and he rubbed his 
mouth to remove the tingle. 

Michels said, “Well, Dahlton,” 
and smiled. He was an easy man 
with gray hair and wrinkles around 
his eyes and mouth. “You’ll be 
wondering if you were sold into 
slavery for a keg of brandy.” 

Nothing of the kind. What 
bothered Little Dahl was his lack 



96 



GALAXY 




of sorrow at parting from Ed and 
Molly. Was he an unfeeling mon- 
ster? Surely security was the first 
desire of all creatures, but he was ex- 
cited at the idea of new experience. 

Tad Michels said, “Freedom is 
earned and the lazy are enslaved, if 
only to themselves— do you see 
what 1 am talking about?” 

“No, sir,” said Little Dahl. 

“We need your help, young man. 
It’s not often someone survives 
Harmonious. There’s equity to be 
done.” 

They drove beyond the loop road 
and left the car at a large building 
dug into a hill. Michel’s explaina- 
tion, “Manufactuary,” did not en- 
lighten Little Dahl. The building 
had a feeling of age about it. He 
and Michel entered by a tall door 
that slid to one side. “Wedgelock,” 
said Michels. They walked down a 
hall with misproportioned doors 
on either side and Michels rapped 
on one of them. An unhuman 
voice said, “Come — ” and the 
door slid aside. The hair on the 
back of Little Dahl’s neck rose 
when he saw the creature on the 
wall bed. 



I T WAS alien, a caricature of 
a man. It swung its feet to the 
floor and stood incredibly long and 
thin. Bones made the skin taut over 
the cheeks, the nose was a beaky 
promontory and the eyes were deep 
in brow caves. It rubbed its nobby 
head with stick fingers and Little 



Dahl half expected the black fuzz 
to crackle. 

“Captain Sheppard, Dahlton 
Bradley has just come to us from 
Harmonious,” said Michels. 

“Displaced, boy? I’m time- 
displaced by the Speakers. Me, 
an interface plug-puller. I found 
this planet and sold it to the 
temple for a scout ship. It went 
against their principles to pay 
me or kill me, so the sanctimo- 
nious rascals tricked me into 
stasis. I figure I’m three hundred 
and eighty-two years old and I 
want my pay.” He drawled the 
words in a way Little Dahl had 
never heard before. It didn’t mat- 
ter. He didn’t understand them 
anyway. 

“What are your plans. Captain?” 
said Michels easily. 

“Get off this one-point-three-oh 
planet, but not back to Earth. 
I’m going to Faradis, a little over- 
due. I want to see if the birth rate 
still runs four female to one male. 
Is Frogface Cluke still stuffed in 
your city, boy?” Little Dahl’s face 
was blank. “I mean Arthur Otis 
Cluke, old Frogface, your found- 
ing father.” 

Little Dahl gulped. Speaker 
Cluke, the indomitable leader, the 
First Speaker of Brocaal. “He is 
guh-guarding us from Heaven, 
sir. My grandfather saw him at the 
tricentennial of the landing.” 

“Jazzed to the ears, 1 bet. They 
couldn’t turn him loose. Frogface 
never took kindly to the creepy 



ROBBIE AND DAVID AND LITTLE DAHL 



97 




clowns you got running things. 
Give the old devil his due. He’s 
no belly-crawling prig. No wonder 
they jazzed him and stuffed him in 
stasis.” The man sighed. “Do you 
know' the central temple, boy?" 

Little Dahl managed to nod. 
His world was reeling. Mt. Cluke 
dominated the city. Speaker Cluke 
stood on the right hand of God. 

“Been in the power room?” 
Sheppard asked. 

“Nuh-no sir,” Little Dahl stut- 
tered at the idea. “It’s suh-sacred. 
It provides the energy to prepare 
food and make plastic.” 

Michels said, “1 don’t understand 
why Harmonious uses plastics 
instead of wood. How extravagant 
in time to grow hemp and raise 
silkworms for building material 
and clothing.” 

“Planned with the best inten- 
tions,” said Sheppard. “Keep 
people busy-busy in a prison with- 
out bars. That’s why they stasised 
Frogface. Modern medievalism 
traps men away from the land 
where they might learn something. 
You can make them dependent as 
dogs. They do any kind of tricks 
to stay home.” 

“But why do they put up with 
it?” 

“Where’s to run to? Security is 
the best blue-sky con game. Is 
there a sacreder place than the 
power room, boy?” 

“The rel-reliquary, suh-sir.” 
How could Harmonious City be a 
prison when it opened the door to 



the afterlife? What could you do 
with your life here and now but 
prepare for death? 

“Do you know where it is. Little 
Dahl?” 

“In the center-center, sir.” 

“We’ll bust that place open,” 
said Captain Sheppard. 

T he next day Little Dahl still 
felt like an ant on a leaf in a 
torrent, except he was riding a 
machine through an ocean of air. 
He looked through a window and 
the world was diminished beneath 
him. The streams were strings of 
shining silk. Tentacles of growing 
things reached fingers into hollows 
and valleys. 

Captain Sheppard crouched in 
the seat beside him and grumbled: 
“Huff and puff and stagger through 
cloudland all day. Eighty miles an 
hour. These people got no idea of 
time. Well, boy, we’ll land short, 
grab us forty winks and make a 
reconnaissance and consult with 
the right hand of God— that all 
right with you?” 

“Yessir,” said Little Dahl. He 
wondered if he would ever under- 
stand anything. The river winked 
up at him. The only mirrors in Har- 
monious were in the temples. Hus- 
bands and fathers were always 
standing around while women went 
to look at themselves. Last night in 
his room, he had seen a figure walk 
toward him from a duplicate room. 
It had thick plastic-yellow hair and 
a smooth, unlined face. The eyes 



98 



GALAXY 




were blue and innocent. They shone 
with honesty, nothing at all like the 
person inside who had stolen salt 
and pushed a Speaker into a river. 

Captain Sheppard was humming 
a sad tune. How could a man 
three hundred and eighty-two years 
old be so childish? Only children 
sang. Grownups felt the drums in 
their bones and were properly silent 
in Harmonious. The man yawned 
and said, “Whatever else, they’re 
not stupid at Haven. They don’t 
want us around to crumb things up. 
1 suppose — ’’ he yawned again — “it 
could be a sense of equity. They 
found me welded in a lost broom 
closet. Here, boy, you fly this 
dratted thing a while.’’ 

He showed Little Dahl how to 
tilt the stick forward to go down, 
and screw it right or left for fast 
or slow. He wriggled in the too- 
small seat and talked all the time. 
Little Dahl heard only some of it 
as he cut over the curves of the 
river. An unplugger pulled out of 
interface at random . that was 
how Captain Sheppard had found 
Brocaal ... the ship from Earth 
split down the middle on landing 
day . the people of Haven were 
reactionaries — whatever that meant 
— and maintained their technical 
culture. Harmonious was settled 
by idealists — whatever they 
were — whose interest was the life 
of the spirit at whatever cost. 
“ — and they made a compact not to 
bother each other, ho-ho. But the 
population’s not doubled since. 



maybe on account of this damn 
heavy one-point-three-oh, so there’s 
no growth pressure— stay away 
from clouds. They’re bumpy.” 

“ Yessir,” said Little Dahl, sweat- 
ing, but he didn’t understand at all. 
Nobody ever started from the be- 
ginning — he felt drowned in un- 
reconciled facts. Sheppard told him 
the ship split in two because it was 
designed that way as a safety mea- 
sure. Safe from what? And the ship 
was not a “box of iron” as he 
learned at school, but the scouts 
were. The ship was more like a pair 
of hollow cubes with everything 
held inside by “wave mechanics.” 
Little Dahl had seen waves and he 
had seen mechanics. He groaned 
aloud. 

Sheppard looked at him. “Hey, 
wake up. There’s the delta on the 
horizon. Twist to slow. Leave the 
stick straight. Crank down on this 
wheel. That’s right, you catch on 
pretty good. We’ll land in that little 
valley ahead and have a snooze. I 
checked the alarm and it’s all right. 
It goes off in four hours, then it 
buzzes for ten minutes and howls 
on interface alarm for five. If they 
got a radio watch in Harmonious 
they won’t hear that. Then the 
whole thing self-destructs. The Ha- 
vens don’t want the nuttys to get 
it.” 

“Yessir,” said Little Dahl, under- 
standing one word out of three. 
Then he could not speak. The river 
ran through hills and there was a 
checkerboard tracery, no bigger 



ROBBIE AND DAVID AND LITTLE DAHL

than a spiderweb in the sunset light. 
The salt ponds and pans. And over 
to the left was Harmonious. That 
small? Was this the city that so 
dominated his mind? 

T he pumps of the air machine 
were silent and there was no 
hiss from the propulsion nozzles. 
The machine settled beside a clump 
of bamboo. Little Dahl was numb 
with fatigue but he could not sleep. 
He was in a state of suspended ani- 
mation, like a wire bridge he’d seen 
at Haven. He was caught in mental 
tension between ground and sky. 
He had just eaten sandwiches with 
the captain, but he longed — in a 
funny way — for holy gruel. Would 
he ever feel at home again? Cap- 
tain Sheppard snored as the night 
wore on. 

The alarm buzzed. Sheppard 
snapped awake. Little Dahl felt like 
a hopper full of lodged salt cap- 
sules. They rose over the hill and 
found the delta country blanketed 
with fog. Sheppard swore. He con- 
sulted the compass and drove 
slowly toward Mt. Cluke, dark over 
the fog. They dropped into the mist 
in total silence. The fog was not 
heavy. They saw a street appear be- 
low them, the row houses dark and 
glum. A neighborhood temple was 
like a bead on the spoke, but Shep- 
pard snorted when the street ended 
and open land began. He turned the 
air machine and drifted along the 
spoke to the center. Visibility was 
two hundred feet. 



At the temple he pulled back and 
flew an arc across the rays. The sa- 
tiva was harvested rotationally. 
The third wedge was freshly plowed 
— the next was being cut and the 
next was in full growth, nine feet 
tall. Little Dahl was horrified when 
the captain proposed to hide the air 
machine in the sativa. Robbie 
Hasseldorf had crossed the growing 
fields with light feet, but the air 
machine would crush the plants. 
The captain growled and said Har- 
monious could get along without a 
few gallons of furfural, which he 
seemed to think was a chief sativa 
product. Little Dahl had never 
heard of it. 

So they landed in total sin, forty 
feet from the center paving. The 
crushed plants had a monstrous 
stink. The acrid pungency wrinkled 
Little Dahl’s nose. It gave him a 
measure of his own displacement. 
The smell was familiar from child- 
hood — and it nearly choked him. 
Sheppard strangled a fit of 
coughing. 

“Sunny beaches!” he said in a 
grating whisper. “That stink really 
torques my jaws!” 

They pushed through the drip- 
ping vegetation. The wide walkway 
was empty. They crossed to an arch 
in the middle of one of the sixty- 
four sides. Against the familiar 
building, Sheppard was a stick man 
who moved with spider quiet. Little 
Dahl shuddered. The stick fingers 
closed on his shoulder as they came 
to the end of the tunnel.

“Whipping machine,” whispered 
Little Dahl, pointing to the left. He 
knew where he was now, just at the 
west-northwest spoke. The center- 
center lay ahead lost in the fog, 
perfectly circular, across four hun- 
dred feet of open space. 

“Now,” whispered Sheppard. 
They ran across the paving and the 
reliquary loomed ahead. Little 
Dahl marveled at how much easier 
it was to run in pants than a smock 
and wondered atheistically if the 
clothing of Harmonious had been 
designed to hinder the wearer. 

Sheppard sucked in his breath at 
the door. “Standard scoutship. 
Number-letter combination. What 
day was the landing. Little Dahl?” 
“The fuh-first day.” 

“Lemme see — oh, hell — hunch 
over to hide the light.” He bent a 
plastic tube and the glass vial inside 
crackled as it broke. The liquid was 
a dilute solution of hydrogen per- 
oxide and a catalyst. It mixed with 
a derivative of salicylic acid. The 
tube glowed yellow green and grew 
brighter and brighter. “Should have 
worn a damn tent to hide it,” grum- 
bled Sheppard. “Eh, I think I re- 
member.” He turned the dials to 
April 1, 2026 and cautiously pulled 
the lever. The door creaked open. 

A wild scream rose behind them. 
The captain pushed Little Dahl 
into the building. “Sacrilege! 
Violation! Awake all! Sac — ” 
Sheppard pulled the door shut 
and he and Little Dahl stood in 
dead silence. Little Dahl was cast 



even more into ambivalence. 
Would he rather take his chances 
outside or be in this iron box with a 
stick man bathed in yellow green 
light? 

“Pretty good guess,” said Shep- 
pard complacently. “April Fool’s 
Day.” He reset the lock from the in- 
side to read July 4, 1776. He was 
not disturbed to be imprisoned in 
the reliquary. Little Dahl was ter- 
rified. The captain opened the inner 
door and walked down a hall. It 
was built to his scale. The doors 
were tall and the slide grip was high 
for Little Dahl. At the end of the 
hall they entered a room filled with 
machinery. The captain was hum- 
ming as he sat in a chair that fitted 
him. He touched a control and 
stopped humming. He swore 
dreadfully. 

1 ITTLE DAHL was frozen. The 
^ chartreuse light was horrible. 
On the floor was a body in a trans- 
parent box. It was not God himself, 
but it was Speaker Cluke. In real 
life — or death — Little Dahl saw 
he was a stick man like Captain 
Sheppard. 

Sheppard’s remarks were un- 
godly. He strode over and kicked 
the box. Little Dahl was again 
amazed by the man. He was not 
angry. 

“We’ll have to jerk Frogface out 
of stasis. Somebody pulled the 
power spool. He might know where 
they put it. Lemme see now.” He 



ROBBIE AND DAVID AND LITTLE DAHL

kneeled beside the box, a demon in 
the crepitating light. He grumbled 
as he pushed and pulled at the base 
of the coffin. “ — didn’t want the old 
devil on his feet a while — prob’bly 
raise hell— stasis is all right, but — ” 
He raised the lid. 

Speaker Cluke continued: 
“ — won’t stand for it! You can’t do 
this to me! The damn dope wore off 
and I’ll see — you all — hanged—” 
He blinked. 

“Hello, Frogface,” said Sheppard. 
“What year, Cappy?” 
“Three-thirty-two after landing.” 
“How’d you get out?” 

“They stuck me in Beta in a 
broom closet. People there didn’t 
find me until last month. How 
come they stasised you?” 
“Somewhat because I didn’t like 
your deal. Somewhat because I 
stood halfway between Alpha and 
Beta. Cappy, how did Beta turn 
out?” 

“They still use the fabrication 
unit and the tapes work fine. Now 
listen, old buddy, here’s the situa- 
tion we find ourselves in — ” and he 
explained about the missing power 
spool. 

“Help me out of the box. Damn 
this heavy gravity. Last time they 
aired me all doped up, damn if they 
hadn’t all shrunk. They look like a 
race of dwarfs — there’s one over 
there!” 

“Not full grown. He’s all right. 
How about the spool?” 

“In interface stasis. I was a step 
ahead of them.” 



“Hell,” said Sheppard, “how 
do we get it?” 

“No sweat,” said God’s right 
hand. “Got a holy two-man inter- 
face rig, sun-powered strip storage, 
no sweat.” 

“Might as well get it now,” said 
Sheppard. 

“Still want to go. to Faradis?” 

“Soon as possible, old friend.” 

Cluke hesitated. “I think you 
need a chaplain.” His voice was sad 
and pondering. “I’ve seen the the- 
ology of discipline in action, God 
help me. Now I’d like to under- 
stand the theology of passion— 
Faradis seems a likely place. I’ll 
go along.” 

“Little Dahl, we’ll be gone half 
an hour,” said Sheppard. “Sit 
tight and we’ll take off for Faradis 
together.” 

Little Dahl could not think. 
If the First Speaker himself found 
BrocaaJ impossible — or was Cluke 
a devil from hell? 

His mind was in a total state of 
turmoil. No time seemed to pass, 
but he heard the men returning. He 
fled on silent feet. He ran down the 
misproportioned hall and through 
the door to the closet. He flung 
himself on the lever. The door 
opened. There were torches in the 
fog. Panic-faced Speakers with- 
drew as he slammed the door. Not 
because of him. 

An enormous voice was saying, 
“ — damn little fool! You’ve but- 
tered your bread — ” whatever that 
meant — “now lie in it. Stand back

all. Stand back, I tell you 

Two Speakers held him firmly. 
Little Dahl breathed deeply of the 
foggy ^he stink of torches 

and sativa and the stink of fear. 
There was silence, then a horrid 
ahoogah-ahoogah noise. 

When the center-center cracked 
its foundations, strained and 
lurched up. Little Dahl was sud- 
denly calm. He did not want to be 
macerated by graters on the ship- 
ping machine. He broke from the 
loosened grasp of his captors and 
fled through the crowd. There was a 
panicky moan and dark figures 
rushed through the tunnel with him. 
They fled on the walks. He plunged 
into the sativa and found the air 
machine. 

This thing was what the captain 
pushed first. A Speaker with an 
enraged face pounded on the win- 
dow. Now crank. The air machine 
rose. And this was what the captain 
did next — but nothing happened 

AND there the machine hung un- 
-iVtil morning when a breeze 
drifted away the fog. The machine 
drifted with it and a crowd of men 
gathered underneath and followed. 
When the sun came up Little Dahl 
took heart after a night of terror. 

The warning alarm buzzed. The 
machine would destruct in fifteen 
minutes and he could do nothing 
about it. The Wind picked up and 
blew him faster than the crowd 
could run. The buzzing grew more 
clamorous. The machine grated to 



a stop on top of Mt. Cluke with 
Harmonious City spread below. 
Little Dahl scrambled out. Men 
circled the hill. He might make 
good fertilizer after all. 

Suddenly they stopped. A sha- 
dow engulfed him. He turned. 

A totally strange ship settled onto 
the crest. The side opened and a 
ramp extended itself. A man in 
glorious red and gold sauntered 
down. 

Little Dahl didn’t hesitate. “Save 
yourself, sir!” he shouted. 

“What-?” 

“Religious fanatics! Tear you to 
pieces! Save me, too!” 

“Heard your interface alarm, 
youngster. Got trouble?” 

The boy panted to the foot of the 
ramp. “Oh, sir, anti-rational mad- 
men! They — uh — killed my parents 
when we landed here. 1 was just a 
baby.” He grabbled with sincerity. 
The crowd was shouting. The man 
in red blinked and began to walk up 
the ramp. The boy followed him. 

“Intentional primitives, hah? 
Come along, then. We'll stretch our 
legs elsewhere. What’s your name, 
boy?” 

The ramp sucked up behind 
them, shutting away a world. 

Robbie Hasseldorf? David De- 
vout? Dahlton Bradley? He didn’t 
want to lead any of those lives 
again. 

“Medlar, sir,” he said bravely. 
His blue eyes shone with innocence 
and a kind of honesty. “Eddie 
Medlar.” ★

.. .he felt in his heart their 
strangeness. Their stillness 
answering his cry. 

T he observers began arriving 
on Wednesday. 

Some had been chosen by their 
governments or by qualified 
selectors. Some had been elected by 
popular vote. Others came by 
special invitation of a Project 
Committe. 

They came from all over the 
world and in various ways. Many 
arrived by sail of other individual 
or exotic transport. An outrigger 
canoe was paddled all the way from 
Samoa by a dozen proud Polynes- 
ians to demonstrate that they still 
revered and were capable of the 
feats of their ancestors. 

One man came in his personal 
submarine and announced his 
intention to explore the ocean floor 
following the occasion. A man 
swam from St. Thomas and a 
woman pedaled a bicycle, mounted 
on two pontoons, from Cuba. One 
man came by balloon, another by 
sailplane. 

The majority arrived by char- 
tered jets or helicopters. 

This was the era of the individual. 
Saturday was the Day of the 
Reply, a holiday in all parts of the 
Earth, a day the planet had been 
awaiting for ninety years. Some 
suggested that the world was wak- 
ing from a long sleep, from a kind 
of wonderful slowed-down reality, 
a dream about humanity and what 



mankind might be like with a bit 
more time, a little less urgency, a 
bit more grace, a little less 
adrenalin. The Project — set up 
nearly one hundred fifty years 
earlier to listen for messages 
from the stars — and the Message 
from Capella that it had received 
and deciphered had given Earth and 
its people ninety years of waiting 
time, during which to explore the 
aspects of humanity other than 
aggression. Many problems that 
had seemed difficult, virtually 
unsolvable, one hundred fifty or 
even ninety years before, had lost 
their urgency. At least so it seemed 
to some. 

Now the Day was at hand. The 
people who arrived to celebrate it 
were of many colors and many 
occupations, but the colors seemed 
somewhat less distinct than they 
used to be and the occupations 
were not as precisely defined — 
everyone seemed a bit dilettante, 
performing his duties and assuming 
his responsibilities with the un- 
dimmed delight and undulled 
awareness of the eternal amateur. 
But the gathering did include 
scientists of all kinds, linguists, 
philosophers, humanists; politicians 
and political figures; newsmen and 
analysts; composers, artists in 
many forms and media, poets, 
novelists and interested citizens. 
Many of them, for convenience, 
traveled under national insignia 
and official aegis, although the 
spirit of nationalism, too, had 



106 



GALAXY 




grown weak during the past ninety 
years. 

Not one of them predicted what 
would happen with the approach of 
the moment when the reply was 
expected from Capella. 

The observers checked in, most 
of them, at the port of Arecibo. 
They then traveled the green hills 
of northern Puerto Rico in buses 
and in limousines, on bicycles and 
on foot. Some spoke of pilgrimages 
and told each other the adventures 
they had experienced on their way. 
Then they arrived at the Project, 
passing the implausibly round 
valley lined with gleaming metal 
and, not far beyond, the steerable 
radio telescope held aloft on a 
metal arm. 

The long, low building that 
housed the Project had grown over 
the century and a half since it had 
been put together with concrete 
blocks and poured cement. Each 
decade had seen it sprawl a little 
farther at each end and now a new 
wing had been attached to the 
back. It housed an auditorium 
especially built for this occasion by 
volunteers and designed so that the 
seating descended the hill behind 
the Project and the roof line 
remained level with the roof of the 
original Project. The auditorium 
extended straight out from the old 
building like the leg of a T. 

T he observers had to pass 
through the ancient corridors 
of the old building to reach the 



auditorium. They admired the 
historic walls and the layers of 
paint that seemed to hold them 
together. They gaped at the listen- 
ing room and paused to hear 
samples of the hisses and crackles 
that were the music of the spheres, 
the background noise of the uni- 
verse and the original recordings 
of the Voices- the fragments of 
radio programs from the nineteen 
thirties with which the Capellans 
ingeniously had first attracted the 
attention of the listeners at the 
Project, fifty years after the 
Project had begun.

They shook their heads in 
wonder and said, “It sounds so 
much better here than in the record- 
ings I’ve heard. So much closer. So 
much more real. Think what it 
must have been like ninety years 
ago to have heard that for the first 
time and have realized that it had 
been all th^ way to Capella and 
back and you were listening to the 
first evidence of intelligent life on 
other worlds.” And everyone 
agreed that it was so. 

After that their path took them 
through the even more impressive 
computer room, where they could 
hear the giant computer whispering 
and clicking and muttering to 
itself and see the lights flicker on 
and off. They watched the various 
readers and printers eating up 
information or spitting it out and 
smelled the oil and ozone that 
were the distinctive odors of 
electrical equipment, big and 
small. And some of them asked 
staff members about the empty 
chairs in the corners, while others, 
more knowledgeable, asked if any 
of them had seen the Presence and, 
depending on their expectations, 
the staff members would raise their 
eyebrows and roll their eyes and 
say, Ves, and it was a terrifying 
experience I can tell you. or 



chuckle and say. He talks to me 
whenever I’m in trouble. or tell 
the truth and say. No one’s seen 
him for a long time, though there 
are those who say they have. 

And whatever they said the 
observers were pleased and went 
on. 

One by one they inspected the 
original Message framed and hung 
on the wall of the director’s office. 

They ran their hands along the 
worn desk where papers had been 
strewn and pencil and pen had 
noted and drawn and calculated. 
And some of them slipped into the 
chair behind the desk, polished by 
the use of generations of directors, 
to sit where they had sat and 
pondered the mysteries of the 
universe and the difficulties of 
communication. Others only 
looked and smelled the old books 
that lined two walls of the office. 

The building was a marvel of 
antiquity, the observers said to each 
other, in some ways rivaling the 
pyramids of Egypt or the castles 
of Europe. You could see, they 
said, how the floors of the corridors 
had been worn by generations of 
passing feet. How many times hadi 
the tile on those corridor floors 
been replaced? The ancient struc- 
ture was a monument to human 
science and perserverance, they 
said, and now it was all going to 
culminate in a wonderful, exciting 
Reply from Capella that would 
bring a new day — or not — but it 
would be wonderful all the same 



108 



GALAXY 




jind the world would be glad it had 

waited. 

l^ow the waiting had come to an 
end. The tempo was beginning to 
pick up. The pulse of the world 
was quickening as the moment 
approached when the giant radio 
ears outside would hear the reply 
that had been started on its way to 
Earth forty-five years ago by an 
alien race faced with possible 
destruction from the explosion of 
their giant red suns. 

MYTHOLOGY: Capella is Latin 
for “little she goat” — a star 
found in the constellation of 
Auriga, the Charioteer, in 
Greek mythology the inventor 
of the chariot. His first 
chariot, according to the 
myth, was drawn by goats. 

NEWS: The second perform- 
ance of the epic eight-hour 
Capella symphony of a young 
Pakistani composer sent half 
its Los Angeles audience 
toward the doors before the 
the musicon tapes, with the 
composer himself at the 
keyboard, were more than 
half played. 

Many of those who left 



stopped at the box office and 
demanded their money back, 
claiming the work was too 
long and too boring. 

The contrast with last year 
was dramatic. At the sym- 
phony’s premiere in New 
York not a person left his 
lounge and, at the conclusion 
the audience paid the com- 
poser, Singhar Khan, the 
ultimate compliment of ten 
minutes of silence, and many 
stayed for hours afterwards 
discussing with friends the 
meaning of the symphony. 

T he program itself began at 
sunset on Saturday. Late 
arrivals had seen a spectacular vista 
of the sun setting behind mounting 
clouds to the west, turning them 
various shades of gold and orange 
and red and then darkening into 
purple and finally black. Those who 
believed in omens said it was an 
omen and those who did not said it 
was a good show all the same. 

The visitors had passed through 
the Project with all its fascinating 
history and mementos and into the 
auditorium. They were ushered 
down resilient ramps and into 
upholstered chairs. They looked

around at the others who were 
assembling and then at the audi- 
torium itself, its muraled walls and 
the recessed stage down front - it 
was not really a stage but a 
speaker’s pit. At the back of the pit 
were some small computer display 
units with switches and dials and a 
few oscilloscopes. At each side of 
the computer units stood a chair. 
The chairs were empty. 

When the visitors had settled 
into their seats the staff members 
of the Project came down the 
center aisle in a group, led by 
William MacDonald, the Project 
director. He was middle-aged. He 
walked briskly to the speaker’s pit 
while his staff scattered into seats 
in front. 

MacDonald faced the audience. 
The lights dimmed. 

“Citizens of the world.” Mac- 
Donald said. His words were 
picked up and heard all over the 
auditorium and flung around the 
world. “Earthmen. Welcome to 
the Project and to the Day of the 
Reply. This occasion and the 
ceremonies that surround it are 
being broadcast to every continent 
and every continental subdivision, 
to our colonies on the Moon and on 
Mars and to all the men who work 
in space — for this is Earth’s day, 
the day all of us have been awaiting 
for ninety years — the earliest 
moment we might hope to receive a 
reply from Capella to the Answer 
we sent to the Capellans ninety 
years ago. 



“But first, into the heart of our 
euphoria, let me inject a few 
milliliters of realism. In about a 
half-hour -as accurately as we can 
measure the distance— we can 
anticipate a reply from Capella. 
That does not mean we will receive 
one. And even if we do, it might 
require processing or formulation 
— which take time. In any case, 
the reply may not come for hours— 
or even days or weeks. We should 
not let ourselves be disappointed or 
become discouraged by delays that 
may be inevitable. We have devel- 
oped patience over the past hun- 
dred and fifty years — we may have 
occasion to continue to exercise it. 

“I am William MacDonald, 
director of the Project. I am the 
third MacDonald to have held this 
position. It is not hereditary,! 
though to some it may have seemed! 
so.” i 



Dry laughter rustled through thejf 
audience. I 

“Perhaps only a MacDonald,”! 
MacDonald continued, “would be! 
willing to spend his life waiting and ! 
listening. I have no son, but forJ 
those of you who might be wonder- 
ing, I do have a daughter who is, 
now a member of the Project staff.: 
“The real work of the Project, 
however, is not performed by the 
director but by the staff. The 
members sit in front of me and I 
would like them to stand as a group 
and be introduced to you — ” 

After the applause had faded to 
only a handclap or two MacDonald 



110 



GALAXY 




said, “Thousands of men and 
women have given their time, their 
energies, their devotion, their lives 
to the Project in its nearly a cen- 
tury and a half. Their work has 
helped the Project reach this point 
in time and history and I would 
like to mention each by name, but 
to do so would take far more than 
the thirty minutes we have at our 
disposal. You will find their names 
in the Project booklet available at 
the door as you leave and as a 
tribute to all of them we have 
placed a symbolic seat at each end 
of the speaker’s pit to remind us of 
them and of their indispensable 
contributions. You may, of course, 
consider them occupied by any of 
the past staff members — by John 
White, for instance, or his son 
,^ndrew, by Ronald Olsen or by 
Charles Saunders -or by any or 
all of them or by the spirit of the 
past, by the unknown staff mem- 
bers. I think of them as being 
occupied by my father and my 
grandfather.’’ 

T he Siberian premier pulled 
himself heavily to his feet. 
“Mr. MacDonald, I have heard it 
said that apparitions of your father 
and your grandfather — what some 
have called a ‘Presence’ — have 
been seen in the computer room of

your grandfather — ” 

MacDonald looked steadily up 
at the big man in his robe and said, 
“The computer can present holo- 
graphic displays of information, 
as you will see before long, I hope, 
but it is our belief that illusions 
such as the one to which you refer 
are beyond its present capability. 
If some of us believe that the 
spirits of the past members of the 
Project linger in the computer in 
the form of dialogue and other 
inputs — why, we all need comfort 
and spiritual assistance at times, 
and strong men bequeath powerful 
memories. 

“The computer will be taking 
over the majority of this presenta- 
tion in a few minutes, for no human 
is quick enough to interpret the 
hoped-for signals as they arrive — 
and this is what the computer has 
been prepared to do for these past 
one hundred and fifty years. That 
preparation and its accumulated 
information and programs and 
linkages have made it an incredibly 
complex creation, but we should 
not project into it our own fears or 
hopes. When you hear the com- 
puter speak you may judge for 
yourself whether it speaks like my 
father or my grandfather or, as 
some maintain, l.ke me or like a 
composite of all of the voices it has 
ever heard. We could instruct it in 
such matters, but we do not. Per- 
haps, as I said, we ourselves prefer 
to think of it as at least a half- 
conscious ally. 



“Now the time has come to turn 
the occasion over to the computer. 
Its presentation will consist of 
vocal communication and holo- 
graphic displays. It will begin with 
a short history of the Project. When 
or if a signal is received either on 
our own antennae or on those of 
the Big Net orbiting Earth, with 
which it is in continual communi- 
cation, the presentation will be 
interrupted . .” 

NEWS; An estimated two 
billions persons were gathered 
around their holovision sets 
today or tonight — since the 
broadcast circled the Earth 
it is impossible to be precise — 
to watch the opening cere- 
monies of the Day of the 
Reply being broadcast from 
Arecibo. The other two 
billion were trying to get to a 
holovision set .

I N ITS recounting of the Pro- 
ject’s history -with pictures, 
still and moving, within the holo- 
graphic square that formed itself 
beside MacDonald — the computer 
had reached the dramatic moment 
when the radio telescope in orbit 
around the Earth— called the Big 
Net — had recorded a tape which, 
with others, had routinely been 
sent to the Project. A long-dead 
man named Saunders had begun 
the process of deciphering that had 
revealed the Voices. But the com- 
puter interrupted itself— then said 
in its own matter-of-fact tones, “I 
am receiving new signals from 
Capella.” 

The audience stirred and sat 
erect. All over the Earth men, 
women and children drew closer to 
their sets. In the live audience at 
the Project a man fainted and a 
woman began to weep. 

“The signals I am receiving from 
Capella,’’ the computer said, “are 
similar to those I have been receiv- 
ing continuously over the past 
ninety years, but there is a signifi- 
cant difference. The signal is being 
repeated now for possible inter- 
ference or signal loss. Now other 
signals are coming in one after the 
other.” 

The audience leaned forward. 
“1 can now display the new mes- 
sage,” the computer said. 



the holographic square, the mes- 
sage took shape;

intervals of about ten seconds 
each.

“These seem to be building a 
vocabulary of words and numbers 
and operators,” the computer said. 
And a few seconds later: “I now 
can state within acceptable limits 
of error that the messages are 
transmitting a vocabulary. At the 
present rate of reception a reason- 
ably complete dictionary and per- 
haps a grammar as well will be 
available within twenty-four hours. 
Symbols are being substituted for 
pictures which no longer are 
adequate for the complex data to 
come. I anticipate that as soon as 
the dictionary is complete the 
pictures will cease and the informa- 
tion will arrive entirely in symbols 
and other abstractions, which will 
raise the level of communication to 
that of history, narrative art and 
possible mathematical equations. 

“1 now am receiving certain 
simple messages in symbols alone.” 

In the part of the audience near 
the Siberian premier people were 
turning to each other, discussing 
something in loud whispers. Others 
around the group were frowning at 
the disturbance. The premier 
stood up again, although some of 
his scientific delegation were ges- 
turing him down. The Siberian 
group was more cohesive than 
most, since Siberia had come late 
to nationalism. 

“Mr. MacDonald,” the premier 
said, “some concern has been 
expressed near me that the input of 
information is proceeding at such 
a rapid rate that the computer will 



not be able to handle it.” 

“No danger,” MacDonald said. 

“What I am saying, Mr. 
MacDonald,” the premier said, 
pulling his robe hem impatiently 
out of the hands of members of 
his retinue who sought to consult 
with him, “is that there may be 
unsuspected dangers involved in 
letting this reception continue.” 

“I assure you,” MacDonald said, 
“that no danger exists.” 

“Your assurance is not enough,” 
the premier said. “Since our words 
are being overheard and recorded . 
by this computer I had hoped that ^ 
as men of diplomacy we might { 
understand each other without | 
telling everything, but now I must \ 
speak without tact. The Capellans 
are technologically advanced and 
desperate. That combination may 
threaten a takeover of your com- 
puter and all the powers that it con- 
trols. The race we are dealing with • 
must be the master of the computer j 
— and who knows what other capa- 
bilities of communication and 
transportation those creatures may 
have. I ask you to take the pre- 
cautions of a reasonable man and 
turn off your machine now while 
we evaluate the situation.” 

A Siberian scientist stood up 
beside his premier and said, “I 
apologize for our leader. It is clear 
that he understands neither the 
nature of the computer nor that of 
the messages that have been 
received.” 

MacDonald held up his hand 



114 



GALAXY 




and a semblance of order was 
restored. “Nevertheless, his ap- 
prehensions are natural and may 
be shared by others in the audience. 
We cannot entirely eliminate the 
possibility of an alien program 
superseding our instructions — but 
from forty-five light-years away 
without any prior knowledge of our 
computer, how it operates, how it 
is programed, without the possi- 
bility of feedback? The probabili- 



ties are infinitesimally small. 
Moreover, we have nothing to fear

from the Reply we have just re- 
ceived. Put the Reply on again — ” 
The Reply again was displayed 
within the holographic square. 

“And the original Message from 
Capella,” MacDonald said, “the 
one we received ninety years ago — 
place that beside the Reply.” 

The two were displayed:

NEWS: A world is waiting for 
an explanation of the Reply 
received from Capella only a 
few minutes ago. Director 
MacDonald is expected to 
reveal at any moment the 
significance of the two mes- 
sages. Premonitions have 
swept the circumference of 
the Earth. Some analysts 
already are pointing out the 
curiously empty appearance 
of the Reply. 

The worldwide audience is 
estimated to have reached 
three billion. 



NEWTON: I do not know what 
I may appear to the world, 
but to myself I seem to have 
been only a boy playing on 
the seashore and diverting 
myself in now and then find- 
ing a smoother pebble or a 
prettier shell than ordinary, 
whilst the great ocean of truth 
lay all undiscovered before 
me . 



<< OU will note,” MacDonald 
■I said, “that some parts of 
the two messages are identical and 
some are different. The most 
important difference is that the 
central figure is missing in the 
Reply. Next most important is 
the altered symbol for the sun in 
the upper right-hand corner — it 
now is the same as the one in the 



lower left-hand corner and the 
symbols that describe them are 
now identical — ” 

A black astronomer stood up in 
the front row. “But that is impos- 
sible,” he said quietly. “The suns 
could not have gone nova. We 
would have had visual evidence by 
now and the appearances of 
Capella have remained un- 
changed.” 

“It means,” MacDonald said, 
“that we made an incorrect as- 
sumption ninety years ago when 
we thought the message said that 
the suns were going nova. It has 
troubled us all for a long time and 
some of us have even speculated 
about the possibility that seems 
confirmed now — what the message 
said about the suns referred to the 
moment in time when the large 
Capella suns consumed almost all 
of the hydrogen in their cores and 
moved off the main sequence. Their- 
cores began to contract — their 
surface layers expanded and they 
became red giants with greatly 
increased temperature and lumi- 
nosity. Those are the changes in: 
size and heat release of their suns 
that the original message de- 
scribed.” 

“And when did this happen?” 
the Siberian premier demanded. | 

“Some time between the recent! 
and the distant past,” MacDonald’ 
said. “It could have been a thou- 
sand years ago— or some millions 
of years.” 

The audience rippled with the 



116 



GALAXY- 




implications of MacDonald’s state- 
ments, but the Siberian premier 
stood unmoved. “And what of the 
Capellans?” 

“Please look again at the mes- 
sages,” MacDonald said. “Notice 
that the Reply has eliminated all 
the so-called words or symbols 
along the left-hand side — all except 
one — and that one is the word for 
Capellan, and it is preceded by 
what I now judge to be the Capellan 
symbol for negation.” 

“Negation?” the premier asked. 

“The Capellans,” MacDonald 
said wearily, “are dead, gone, 
cremated. Even the symbols for 
their planets bear testimony to their 
fate. The superjovian is somewhat 
reduced in size from the expansion 
and heat of the near sun, which 
now is perhaps ten times its former 
size — and the smaller satellites of 
the superjovian all have been con- 
sumed except for one Earth-size 
planet — which we have taken in 
the past to be the home planet of 
the Capellans. And it apparently 
has lost considerable mass, perhaps 
by the boiling away of its oceans 
and atmosphere, perhaps by in- 
ternal explosions.” 

“We have been communicating 
with a race long dead?” the pre- 
mier asked. 

“Apparently,” MacDonald said. 
“They seem to have set up auto- 
mated self-repairing equipment to 
pick up evidences of possible future 
civilizations and send a message to 
them. If the equipment received 



any response— indicating that a 
technological civilization was listen- 
ing— it would begin sending — ” 
“What’s the point of all this if 
they are dead?” 

“I have a message,” the com- 
puter said. “It has been sent in the 
simple vocabulary developed so far 
and there are some uncertainties in 
the exact meaning of certain words 
and phrases. But the message, with 
alternative readings, follows. I will 
present it visually for greater 
comprehensibility.”

“And the Project?” the premier 
asked. “1 suppose that your job 
is done.” 

“In a sense,” MacDonald said. 
“Now the work of the world begins. 
The messages the computer is re- 
ceiving, storing, analyzing, inter- 
preting, contain what we assume to 
be the entire record of a civiliza- 
tion alien to almost everything we 
know except intelligence and 
emotion, a civilization considerably 
advanced beyond ours — not only 
its history but, if my assumptions 
are correct, its philosophies, cul- 
ture, art, science, technology, 
theology and literature are now 
available to us. 

“We have received a legacy more 
valuable than the physical pos- 
session of another world with all 
its natural treasures. The world’s 
scientists and scholars and every- 
one else who wishes may explore 
it. 

“As for the Project itself, our 
search has lasted for less than a 
century and a half and we have 
come up with one major find. Who 
knows what civilizations, what 
strange and wonderful people, we 
may discover somewhere between 
here and the edges of the universe?” 

The room was silent. The world 
paused and then resumed what 
it was doing. 

But it was not the same world. It 
was a world bereft of a friend, yet 
not deprived of that friend — that 
cosmological friend. 

And somewhere among the 



magnetic spots and fluxes, among 
the miniature relays, among the 
fugitive flows of electrons, a 
connection occurred, a memory 
stirred: 

. .and the silence surged 
softly backward. 

It was like the vagrant thought 
of the shadow that may have been 
sitting at either end of the speaker’s 
pit or of any of the thousands of 
men and women who had passed 
through the Project or lingered in 
its corridors and rooms for years, 
who remained in some form within 
the computer itself. 

The transmission from Capella 
would continue for days or weeks 
or months, but eventually the 
last of the inheritance from another 
star would be handed over, the mes- 
sages would cease and the silence 
would surge softly backward. 

And then the radio telescope 
shaped like an ear of Earth held 
up on an arm to listen to the secrets 
of the universe and the radio 
telescope shaped like a bowl to 
catch the stardust, would come 
alive and begin a new search of the 
heavens for a message from the 
stars. 

By then the computer would be 
at least half Capellan. No one but 
the computer would realize this 
until a half-century later, at 
about the time the Project would 
pick up a message from the Crab 
Nebula. ★

H arlan Ellison has done it 
again. 

(Pondering a line like that, one 
visualizes those glossy novelties 
found in the bookshops — along 
with baby pictures carrying funny 
quotes — Where to Find It in Des 
Moines, Macrame with Bubble 
Gum, volumes of mountain scenery 
facing free verse, both out of focus. 
The Hard hat’s Book of Harpsi- 
chords and the like. And among 
them a whole book of phenomena, 
one for each page — the Taj Mahal, 
the February 9th earthquake. 
Mounts Everest, Etna and 
Olympus, the Watts riots, Ursula 
Andress, a pregnant alligator, 
nuclear physics, Barry Malzberg, 



Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, an 
oyster pizza, the Crown of Thorns 
starfish, metamphetamines and the 
Song of Songs. And on each and 
every page the single caption: 
Harlan Ellison has done it again.) 

It all began three years or so ago 
when Ellison had a dangerous vi- 
sion called Dangerous Visions, 
which Doubleday published in a 
whacking great hardcover and 
Berkley doled out in three separate 
paperbacks. (1 gather that the 
former is now out of print, but the 
Berkleys are still available at 95 i 
per.) The idea was to cajole writers 
into writing new fiction, new kinds 
of fiction, in the sf area— which 
means, as Damon Knight once 



119 




said, what you’re pointing at when 
you say “science fiction”— with 
no holds barred, no taboos, hardly 
any restrictions on length. The 
book caused, not a sensation, but 
a great many of 'em, among which, 
in some quarters, were irritation, 
distaste, anger — and apparently 
terror, judging by some of the 
response. Harlan he do go on. His 
intro was lengthy, his forewords to 
each story sometimes prolix and 
sometimes just weird (but always 
in the pyrotechnic Ellison manner) 
and he took a lot of lumps for in- 
serting himself so heavily into the 
volume. In the volume now under 
discussion, however, he makes the 
perfectly just point that his ef- 
fusions are nowhere concealed — 
and if you find them irritating just 
don’t read them. You’ve still got a 
quarter of a million words of damn 
good work by other people in your 
hands. Personally I find the intro- 
ductions and the various authors’ 
“afterwords” fascinating, and Elli- 
son at his most abrasive hasn’t yet 
set up my back hair as much as 
Bernard Wolfe in the new volume. 

. But I’m getting ahead of myself. 

Know ye then that there is now 
a new Ellison anthology called 
Again, Dangerous Visions; that it 
is enormous (some 750 pages) and 
beautiful (end papers and decora- 
tions — for each story, mind — by 
the incomparable Emsh) and has, 

120 



if anything, more Ellison in it than 
the previous book. It is also enor- 
mous in price— $12.95 from Dou- 
bleday— and I do not know when 
or if it will go into paperback. (It 
probably will - I’ll let you know). 

What needs to be said most 
about this extraordinary volume is 
that whatever it is Harlan thought 
he was going to do in the first vol- 
ume (and did well enough to scoop 
up a double brace of Nebulas and 
Hugos for his writers and a plaque 
for himself) he has learned to do 
really well by now. Like certain 
editors before and around him (one 
thinks of Terry Carr, Don Ward, 
Don Bensen and Knox Burger) he 
has the ability to anger, inspire, 
persuade, bribe or flog stories out 
of writers they otherwise could 
not achieve — or didn’t think they 
could — till it was made to happen. 
There is a wonderful ease and 
openness about the stories in this 
volume. Some violate taboos, but 
by no means all — and when they ; 
do, it is almost never with that 
little-boy-chalk ing-on-the-fence air 
that many of the so-called main- 
stream writers exhibit. The spec- 
trum of subject matter is amazingly 
wide — one has that opening-up 
feeling, like learning of UHF when ' 
one thought VHP was all there is, 
or of finding out that girls are, after 
all, more than littler, squeakier .

stories in the book, some mean- 
ingless ones, which is inevitable 
jp a book of this size and scope, 
PS I am sure you’ll agree with 
pie— as sure as I am that we won’t 
agree with each other on which 
the bad and meaningless ones are. 

One very interesting aspect of 
this book is that although it is an 
Ellison product —and although we 
all know that Ellison has the knack 
of geltgain or being where money 
is— he has produced something 
that seems purposely designed to 
make difficulties for himself. First 
of all, the woods are not full of 
fans so ardent they will part with 
$12.95 even for so handsome and 
joyous a tome as this. I can only 
applaud Harlan’s willingness to 
take such a course. This is a presti- 
gious book and he knows it. It 
won’t be put down; it won’t just be 
ignored and go away. He has so 
designed it that its effect on current 
literature and thought will not be 
explosive, will not father a series 
of diminishing echoes — instead, 
by his choices he has turned it into a 
spansule, which by continuing 
controversy and the momentum of 
enlightenment (those are two of the 
better forces still at work in our 
troubled world) will go on having 
its initial effect for years. Tolkien’s 
Hobbit and the trilogy came on like 
that, though I’m making no other 
parallel between the works. I must 



hand Harlan Ellison special kudos 
for deliberately aiming so com- 
mendably high. I happen to know 
how incredibly much work went 
into the book, as I also know that 
Ellison has plowed every nickel he’s 
made from the whole project right 
back in— and then some. It’ll be 
many a moon before any black ink 
shows for him on the DV efforts. I 
just hope Doubleday keeps it in 
print for about twice as long as 
they now think they can, for the 
book will go on provoking and in- 
furiating and entertaining people 
for a long time to come. 

1 have, you’ve noticed, rather 
scrupulously avoided details about 
authors and stories. I’d much ra- 
ther you have the Christmas- 
morning joy of opening the package 
for yourself — but it’s my duty to 
tell you that this enormous package 
contains short ones and long ones, 
plenty of names like Bradbury, 
Vonnegut, and Bernard Wolfe and 
a fine spattering of unknowns. So 
you can say “I knew him/her 
when.” There are hardcore sf yarns 
and yarns so far out they haven’t 
made their Wave yet. Get the book

rad. It’s like a sampler of Ellison’s 
whole approach in the monumental 
DV effort, but with Spinrad’s own 
special and salty touch. Spinrad’s 
introduction, damning the labelers 
who try so hard to compartment 
an already compartmented field, 
is one of the best I’ve ever read and 
his table of contents is full of ex- 
citing names — Moorcock, Delany, 
Silv^rberg, Ellison, Disch, Farmer 
and others. 

T he depth of devotion, the out- 
and-out caring, of the science- 
fiction and fantasy fans is a source 
of wonder to me. I have never been 
a de facto fan — but I have not and 
cannot put down those who are. 
Now and again along comes one 
who elevates my wonder into awe 
— and such is Walt Lee, who has 
sent me a sample of a work-in- 
progress called Reference Guide 
to Fantastic Films. 

In its final typed form, the Guide 
runs over 1900 pages. It contains 
approximately 20,000 film listings 
from about fifty countries over a 
75-year period. The information on 
each film covers the title, the alter- 
nate titles if any, production and 
release data, length, credits, cast, 
fantastic content, references to 
source material, origins of the 
story, sequels, if any, and so on— 
the whole thing carefully cross- 
indexed. The man has researched 



the Guide and worked on it for 
twenty years. What it has cost him 
in time and effort and — well, damn 
it, love — is quite beyond calcu- 
lation. What it will cost you, if he 
gets enough orders to go through 
with it, is $22.50 before publica- 
tion, $28.00 after. 

But it doesn’t have to cost you 
that much personally unless, of 
course, you want your very own 
copy to drool over, and 1 wouldn’t 
blame you for that. A lot of readers 
never seem to have found out about 
their local libraries and how they 
acquire books and just why they 
buy the books they buy and not 
others. Someone— perhaps a mem- 
ber of the committee which meets 
regularly to make up the order, or 
someone who knows a member, or 
someone who is willing to go 
through the squeaky-wheel bit to 
the librarian and keep on squeaking 
until the book arrives — someone 
pressures each and every book 
purchase. 

Another approach: If your local- 
ity is served by a CATV outlet 
which publishes its own TV pro- 
gram guide — or by a big-city news- 
paper that has one as part of the 
Sunday supplement — they’d b^ 
glad to hear of such an extraor^ 
dinary reference. So would inde-i

theater-chain operators, who are

O UR very own Lester del Rey 
(and by “our” I mean not 
only the readers of the Galaxy 
group, but the followers of late- 
night talk shows — “The Magnifi- 
cent,” he was called) and one of the 
brighter lights of that extraordinary 
collection of luminaries discovered 
and developed by the late John 



Campbell, as well as the world’s 
most successful collector of Judy- 
Lynn Benjamins — our very own 
Lester del Rey has, at (too) long 
last, written another novel. 

Pstalemate (Putnam, $4.95) is 
the vital and exciting tale of a 
man’s discovery of his own 
strength, his own self. I have long 
held that great and lasting fiction 
is fable — that is to say, it states 
something human, something 
learnable, by means of the narra- 
tive and is written, or driven, by 
that statement rather than by the 
narrative itself. (Stories which do 
only the latter are properly called 
entertainments. An honorable thing 
for a story to be— but the value will 
not last.) Del Rey’s book is by no 
means the first to say that a man 
must thoroughly and fearlessly 
know himself and what he is (oh, 
how his protagonist fights back on 
that one!) but his is the first 1 can 
recall that puts the full power of 
his searchlight on: “Misinterpre- 
tation is the most deadly of human 
sins.” 

Think about that. 

Pstalemate's ground is that of 
psi powers. It comes with the 
generous del Rey’s bonus of infor- 
mation and insights re the in- 
ternal combustion engine, biology, 
mutation theory and loving. An 
enriching experience and a good 
book. ★

T he boy wanted to go fishing. 

“No time for it,” Somers said. 
“No time for that. And no river, 
either,” he added to settle the 
matter. 

The boy shook his head. “No,” 
he said. “You’re wrong — about the 
river I mean.” 

“Wrong? I’ve been on this god- 
forsaken place five years now. So 
dry you can’t grow hair on your 
head. Look at it,” growled Somers. 
“Show me a river.” 

They looked. Standing on the 



porch of the old Earth-type 
dwelling. The fine yellow soil ran 
away from them, mile after mile. 
A few stunted bushes grew in the 
windless air. Air? It parched a 
man’s lungs year by year. Air was 
something you could suck deep, 
sweet as water, letting it rush and 
surge in your lungs to taste the 
sweetness. 

Take this Alpha air too fast and 
you could drown in your own 
fluids, lungs crackling and splitting , 
inside like old bellows. Air, ^

thought Somers. This, by God, 
wusn t air. 

He was an old man to be here. 
But he had stood on enough 
mountains, walked enough plains, 
lived close against the wilderness 
wherever he could for so long that 
it was natural Tor him to be here. 
The vista was wide, untouched — 
most of it unexplored he had to 
admit now, faced Avith the boy’s 
persistence. 

“Well, it could be true, couldn’t 
it?” the boy asked. “There could be 
a river somewhere.” 

Something in the boy’s eyes 
awakened memories in Somers. 
Fresh mountain springs, great rock 
basins catching cool rain, funneling 
it down, creeks forming in gullies, 
coming together, making rivers, 
flowing faster, deeper, over rocks 
and stones, through cool glades 
with trees overhanging, fat leaves 
juicy with caterpillars, the trout 
lying in the shade at the edge of the 
current waiting for the river to 
bring them food downstream. Soft 
plop, a squirming bait on a hook, 
the flash of a fish. Fish! Somers 
had fished. 

“Could be, I guess,” he admitted. 
“Haven’t been everywhere. But 
where would it come from? No 
mountains in sight. Only rains once 
a year and it soaks in so fast you 
couldn’t graze camels on what 
grows. If it wasn’t for supplies from 



home we'd all be dead. If there's a 
river it’s got to come from some- 
where and go somewhere. That’s 
one of the rules about rivers.” 
“One morning,” the boy said, 
“I’m going to get up real early and 
I’m going to take the whole day 
from dawn to dark— and I’ll find 
it.” 

Somers’ eyes became shadowed. 
“How old are you now, boy?” 
“Fifteen.” 

“Well if you want to be sixteen, 
forget that river.” 

Somers remembered later how 
the bdy just looked at him then. 

“You don’t forget,” the boy said, 
“about your rivers.” 

Next day, partly out of curiosity 
and partly for plain workaday 
reasons, Somers took his hammer 
and some sample boxes out to the 
west, where the boy said he’d heard 
the river was. He spent all day out 
there, chipping at rocks and 
scanning the landscape — but there 
were no gullies, just the sand, 
the round boulders coming up like 
the knees and elbows of the world 
as the wind wore it down, and the 
clear purplish sky with that big 
sick sun glaring down. There were 
no rivers. 

I T WAS nearly dark when 
Somers reached home. The 
lights of the place were like a bene- 
diction in the still, clear, alien night. 



GONE FISHING

When he went in he saw that 
Helen’s face was drawn. 

“Did you hear the ship?” she 
asked him. 

“No,” he lied. He had heard it 
at midday, a distant rumble of 
thunder. 

“Taking somebody else home,” 
Helen said. 

Somers reached out then in plain 
view of the boy and touched her 
hair. She had fine hair, gray now, 
once black as space, and her eyes 
and lips softened at his gesture, 
because she knew what a hard man 
she had married thirty years ago. 

“I don't mind,” she said. “Not 
for another year.” 

“We’re going back,” Somers 
said. “Next time our company ship 
comes in we’ll go home with it. 
That’s my promise, Helen.” 

She nodded and smiled, but later 
in the middle of the night he heard 
her crying as though she had lost 
her mind with joy. He hadn’t 
known how much she cared. 

What to do about the boy? 

His neighbor. Josh Andrews, had 
left last year and the boy had 
worked for Josh. Before that the 
boy had been on some trade ship or 
other, a drifter, orphaned, nowhere 
to go and not sure where he had 
come from. When Josh had left the 
boy had asked to stay on and 
Somers had taken him in, even 
though he made an extra mouth to 



feed and there wasn’t enough work 
for the two of them — you needed 
trained eyes to pick out that glow 
of precious metal from a desert of 
sand. Loneliness had been part of it. 
And childlessness the rest. 

A dry barren land and a dry 
barren wife, Helen had said one 
bitter night, years before on that 
other pale world of sand and sky. 

A man like you should have a son. 
Born here. On Mars. That night 
had been the last time it was men- 
tioned, twenty years ago. On 
another world. And now Somers 
thought of it again. 

The boy was the son they should 
have had. He was like a small rock 
himself that had been bounced 
around in a sample box. Short, 
tuff-haired, blue eyes like Helen’s. 
He was slow to learn, dreamy 
sometimes — but now Somers 
didn’t want to leave him behind. 

They asked him, afraid of what 
his answer would be. 

“No,” he said. “I don’t want to 
stay. But — ” 

Somers sat outside that night, 
watching the stars. The boy came 
out to join him, walking with a 
hint of a swagger, and the two of 
them stared back toward the sun. •: 

Then the boy said, “One thing I : 
want to do before I go. One thing I ^ 
want to find. That river.” ' 

Somers laughed. 

“I’m not leaving till I do.” 



128 



GALAXY 




A river on a dead world, green 
water and the flash of a fish -what 
if he found them? Somers walked a 
mile farther west that day and came 
back after dark, afraid for a 
moment that he had missed his 
place— until he separated its light 
from the hard white stars and made 
it home. 

“Don’t go out again,” Helen 
pleaded in the darkness of their 
room. “Don’t go so far. Not now— 
not when we’re leaving.” 

She saw how still his face was in 
the starlit room. She went to the 
window and gazed out. 

IVomen like Helen, he thought, 
on these strange worlds. women 
don't like to travel and here she is, 
four light-years from home, never 
complaining. 

“Why?” she asked softly, watch- 
ing his drawn face. “Why’s he 
doing this? To test us — to see if we 
want him?” 

“Or because we want him,” 
Somers said. 

She turned, the starlight shining 
on her hair, her face in shadow. 
“I’m afraid of him suddenly, 
John.” 

Somers swung away angrily, 
took off his clothes and climbed 
into the old bed. He lay staring up 
at the ceiling. After a moment 
Helen undressed, too, and slipped 
in beside him. He felt the warmth 
of her body against his and he 



turned. For a moment in the 
gloom-soft face he saw their youth 
and he turned on his back and 
glared up at the ceiling. 

“What do you want, John, 
really want?” 

“Me? I just want to go home to 
Earth.” 

“Then why did you come here?” 
she asked softly. 

He didn’t answer. The house 
creaked and settled. The world 
spun silently through space, a 
bubble turning deep down in the 
endless sea. Through the wall, in 
the stillness, Somers thought he 
could hear the boy breathing 
steadily in sleep. 

Somers turned to lie on his side. 
“First thing tomorrow I’m going 
out again,” he said. 

B ut next day the news shrieked 
down the line from all their 
neighbors. “Earth! Earth!” 

“What about Earth?” 
“Destroyed!” 

“What?” asked Somers. “What 
did they say?” 

The colonists on Mars had been 
close enough to see the blast — 
their own world had been rocked 
in its orbit. The news poured in — 
an internal explosion had rent the 
crust — the planet had broken 
apart — somebody somewhere, in 
some unknown time and place, had 
made a miscalculation. All was 



GONE FISHING 



129 




gone, except for the handful of 
stick-dry people on two dead 
worlds, Mars and Alpha Centauri. 
Everyone sat in silence that day 
and night, thinking about it. Space, 
at midnight when Somers walked 
outside, seemed to press down like 
a great weight. It was hard to 
breathe, looking up into that 
immensity. 

We're alone, Somers thought. 
Once a teeming race, searching, 
questing, billions of us — and now 
just the scraps left, a few here, a 
few back there on Mars. 

A ragged few. The pioneers. And 
now there were only the frontiers 
left. 

No company ship would come, 
bringing supplies. How long could 
the colonists last without food and 
canned water? Radios were beginn- 
ing to babble with fear. How? How 
can men survive? What can we do? 
Who’s got the answers? 

Somers sat around for two more 
days. Then he strode to his 
storeroom. He packed food and 
water into three knapsacks and told 
Helen and the boy what they 
would do. 

“Our only chance is to find that 
river.” 

Helen’s eyes were strange. “John, 
we were here when it happened, not 
on Earth. I’m so glad of that.” 

He looked surprised. 

“I loved Earth,” she said. 



“But — I’ve thought about it. I’m 
glad there are only people like us 
left. We are the real humans, not 
those others — those stockbrokers 
and clerks and housewives and 
advertising men and doctors and 
lawyers, all growing fat on her 
corpse. They killed Earth, John, 
just like they killed all those others 
places our people went to first. The 
plains, the forests, the mountains. 
The rivers and oceans and the 
creatures in them. We were there 
first — then others came and 
spoiled everything. And they would 
have come here — they were already 
planning that — and they would 
have found some way to live off 
this world too — this strange, wild 
place.” Helen smiled. “You 
thought I just followed you.” 

Somers said softly, “We’ll find 
that river and build a shack right 
'on its banks. A place like the one 
in California, remember? And 
we’ll irrigate and grow crops, and 
in the evenings we’ll fish under the 
trees all summer long.” He picked 
up Helen’s knapsack and helped 
her put it on. “Now where’s the boy 
got to?” 

She smiled. “He went outside. 
Just a minute ago while we were 
talking.” 

Somers put on his own knapsack 
and hefted the boy’s. They did not 
bother to lock up — ^just took one 
last glance around. 



130 



GALAXY 




“Let’s go,’’ he said quickly. 

They went outside. There was no 
sign of the boy. Helen stood waiting 
while Somers looked around. 

“Where the hell is he?” 

She pointed. “Look.” And he 
saw the tracks leading off toward 
the west. Somers squinted against 
the glare of the sun, but he could 
see no sign of the boy except the 
footprints leading away through 
the yellow sand. 

“He’s gone,” Helen said. “Gone 
without us.” 

“But he gave us the river,” 
Somers said. Helen looked worried. 
He shouldered the third knapsack. 
“He won’t get far without supplies. 
We’ll catch him.” 



They walked side by side away 
from the house, following the boy’s 
tracks. The tracks went straight 
across the desert, directly west. 

“Look,” Helen said again. 
Somers turned his head. 

Miles away but visible on the 
clear horizons, were other families. 
Men and women and children. 
Small specks, moving steadily 
forward like ants. 

“A hell of a lot of people still 
believe in that river,” Somers said. 

He took Helen’s hand and they 
plodded on, eyes always fixed on 
the edge of the world where the 
sky was deepest, mysterious blue. 
Following the boy.

LARRY EISENBERG 



Duckworth explodes the population — 
or how to go forth and multiply! 

T he day was warm; the trees 
were in bloom and the campus 
was virtually matted with entwined 
bodies. Duckworth paused at the 
window of his lab to glance out. 

“Look at those damned kids,” 
he muttered. “God, how I envy 
them.” 



132 




I looked out and smiled. 

“What would you do, Duck- 
worth,” I asked, “if you had to 
start all over again?” 

“I’d devote myself to sex,” he 
said emphatically. “Science is 
too demanding a task-mistress.” 

“They don’t offer a Nobel award 
for sex,” I said. 

Duckworth stroked his stringy 
beard. 

“They would create one for me,” 
he muttered. 

Silence lay heavy in the room, a 
silence of tormented thoughts 
about the warm lawn outside. I 
coughed and Duckworth was star- 
tled back to our immediate 
problem. 

“Have you finished programing 
for my lens designs?” he asked 
testily. 

“I have. Give me the range of 
parameters and I’ll set the com- 
puter to work.” 

Duckworth reached over to his 
desk and sifted through the 
mounds of cluttered paper. 

“I had it a moment ago,” he 
fretted. “Ah, here it is.” 

I took the yellow foolscap bear- 
ing his scrawled pencil notes and 
started to leave the room. But nag- 
ging curiosity overcame my nor- 
mal discretion. 

“What have you got in mind?” I 
asked. 

“Nothing spectacular,” said 



Duckworth. “I’m planning to set 
up a multilens system to work 
with my electron microscope.” 

“Do you want multiple pic- 
tures of molecular structure?” 
“Something like that,” said 
Duckworth. “But I have an even 
better idea. Using a laser source. 
I’m going to take each image and 
mix it with the reference beam.” 
“A multiple hologram? What on 
earth for?” 

Duckworth chuckled. 

“Each hologram will give me a 
great number of molecular recon- 
structions, all three-dimensional 
and projected to a different part 
of my lab. I can then assign a dif- 
ferent technician to each image 
so that diverse properties can be 
looked at simultaneously. It will 
save enormous amounts of time.” 
“Ingenious,” I said. “And it 
should work.” 

Duckworth stared at me. 

“Can you keep a secret?” he 
asked. 

I was hurt. 

“Haven’t 1 always?” 

“Well,” said Duckworth. “Most 
of the time.” 

“If that’s your attitude, don’t tell 
me.” 

“My idea,” said Duckworth, 
“is to run my multiple holographic 
system on-line. What I mean is, I 
plan to use a television camera 
and a high-speed multiple scan- 



THE GRAND ILLUSIONS 



133 




ning laser system with simultan- 
eus projection capability. In 
other words, 1 can photograph 
any scene, microsopic or ma- 
croscopic, and then project as 
many three-dimensional recon- 
structions of that shot as I like.” 
I became truly excited. 

“If I understand you correctly, 
you’d be able to take a scene as it’s 
happening and project it in three- 
dimensional form elsewhere.” 
“Precisely,” said Duckworth. 
“And now, if you will punch out 
those cards with my lens data we 
can get this project under way.” 
“I’m gone,” I cried and suited 
action to the words. 

T he calculations were com- 
pleted the following day and 
the information was sent to the 
University lens-grinders. Duck- 
worth called on Mr. Schultz, who 
was in charge, to find out when the 
lenses would be ready. Mr. Schultz 
looked up from his newspaper in 
annoyance at the interruption. 

“We have a tremendous back- 
log, Dr. Duckworth. It will be 
months before I can even look at 
your order.” 

Duckworth’s fingers opened and 
closed spasmodically. 

“1 want those lenses by next 
Tuesday — or else.” 

A thoughtful silence fell behind 
the newspaper. 



“How about Thursday?” asked 
Mr. Schultz. 



T he lenses came on schedule 
and the construction of the 
complex optical system began with 
Duckworth himself doing virtu- 
ally all of the assembly. I mar- 
veled at the uncanny control in 
those spidery fingers and the sure 
way in which he contrived impos- 
sible arrangements of lasers, 
beam-splitters and diffraction 
gratings. 

I arrived one day to find Duck- 
worth ready for a preliminary 
test. 

“I’d like to develop a static 
hologram to see how well my sys- 
tem is working so far,” said 
Duckworth. 

“How do you propose to do 
that?” I asked. 

“Well,” said Duckworth, strok- 
ing his beard, “I don’t want to try 
anything too elaborate as yet. I’d 
like to take a color slide of some- 
thing and generate a full scale 
three-dimensional reproduction in 
the lab.” 

“Stay right where you are,” I 
said. “I’ve got the very thing for 
you.” 

I went to the computer labora- 
tory and rummaged through my 
desk drawer until I found it. It was 
an exquisite slide of a great work 



134 



GALAXY 




of art. I held it up to the light, 
gazed at it soulfully, finally wrap- 
ped it carefully in soft tissue paper 
and went back to Duckworth’s 
lab. He inserted the slide in 
an improvised holder, adjusted 
a lens stop and turned on the 
projector. In the center of the 
room, as large as life and in the 
exquisite bloom of her beauty, 
appeared a full three-dimensional 
version of The Naked Maja of 
Goya. 

“It works,” I cried. “Your setup 
functions perfectly.” 

Duckworth didn’t seem to hear 
me. He was staring at the lovely 
figure in rapt admiration. 

“What a knockout,” he said. 

He walked forward to admire 
her at close range. As he stood just 
beyond the reclining figure, he 
reached out his hand gingerly. 

“Doesn’t it seem as though I 
could touch her?” he asked. 

“I wish you could,” I said 
enthusiastically. 

1 did not hear the lab door open 
or the padded footsteps behind 
me. Not until an inhalation of 
air like the sucking in of a thou- 
sand eggs took place at my ear did 
I realize that someone was 
standing behind me. I turned. 

“President Hinkle,” I said. 

He had flushed to the very roots 
of his noble head. 

“I’m sorry, Duckworth,” he 



said. “I didn’t mean to intrude on 
a t'ete-a-tete." 

And turning on his heel, he left 
the room with as much hurt digni- 
ty as he could muster. 

“My God, Duckworth,” I said. 
“He thinks — ” 

“I know what he thinks,” inter- 
rupted Duckworth. “He’s got a 
dirty mind. I only wish he were 
right.” 

“But he’s a terrible gossip,” I 
said. “The whole faculty will hear 
about this and probably the non- 
faculty, too.” 

“Let them eat their hearts out,” 
said Duckworth. “I’ve got work to 
do.” 

B ut Duckworth had underesti- 
mated the prudishness of Presi- 
dent Hinkle. The following day, 
we were both summoned to the 
presidential office. Duckworth 
seemed absolutely unshaken, but 
my knees were generating a full 
trenir. 

We were not asked to sit. Presi- 
dent Hinkle glared first at me, 
then at Duckworth. 

“Well, Duckworth?” he said at 
last. “What have you to say for 
yourself?” 

“I’m a man,” said Duckworth. 
“Need 1 say more?” 

The president began to growl. A 
purplish flush mounted toward 
his scalp. 



THE GRAND ILLUSIONS 



135 




“And what about you?” he de- 
manded balefully, directing his 
formidable gaze at me. “You, a 
married man!” 

I did not have Duckworth’s sang 
froid and I broke down and told 
all. The president did not seem 
amused, nor did he at first seem to 
believe me. Not until he had ac- 
companied us back to the labo- 
ratory and seen how the figure 
was reconstructed did he relent. 
As we left the lab I glanced back 
and saw him reach out a gnarled 
hand toward the Maja’s thigh. 

W HEN autumn came the cam- 
pus stirred from its summer 
lethargy. Elections were held for 
the Academic Council, an adviso- 
ry body to President Hinkle, and 
much to my surprise Duckworth 
and I made it as compromise 
candidates. 

“I’m appalled,” said Duckworth 
at lunch the following day. “How 
did they ever see me as a compro- 
mise candidate? I’m far to the left 
of Stringfellow Schwartz.” 

I was equally hurt. 

“So am I,” I muttered. 

“1 think we’ve been done in by our 
habits,” said Duckworth thought- 
fully. “Some of the New Left think 
that devotion to one’s craft 
is incompatible with fighting 
inequities.” 

“They’ll find out soon enough,” 
136 



1 said. “President Hinkle has 
called us into immediate ses- 
sion. Something has come up.” 
Duckworth stifled a groan. 

“Hinkle will be making one of 
his three-hour summaries. It 
means another day’s delay in my 
experiments.” 

Duckworth was wrong. Presi- 
dent Hinkle managed to confine 
his opening remarks to slightly 
over two-and-one-half hours. It 
seemed that the students had pre- 
sented demands President Hinkle 
viewed with utter horror. Fright- 
ening him most was one that called 
for a cessation of all military-sup- 
ported research on campus. 

“They want to bankrupt the 
University,” stormed Hinkle. 
“Don’t these young wretches rea- 
lize it takes tremendous sums of 
money to pay for their damned ed- 
ucation? The tuition pays only a 
small part of it.” 

“Why not confine all of our re- 
search to peaceful areas?” su- 
gested Duckworth. 

Hinkle’s normally florid face 
turned an apoplectic crimson. 

“God damn it, Duckworth,” he 
bellowed. “You know the score. 
Our funds have been cut in every 
form of research. The only ones 
spending any money are the mili- 
tary services. Why should we cut 
off our noses to spite our faces?” 

I cleared my throat nervously. 

GALAXY I 




“Why don’t we lobby to have the 
remaining funds diverted to bio- 
niedical resources? It might take 
lime, but sometimes the moral 
choice is less painful in the end.” 

“I’ll remember that when you 
make your new budget requests 
for the computer facility,” Hinkle 
growled. 

Dean Frisbie, who had been 
wordlessly but agitatedly cracking 
his knuckles, finally ventured a 
question. 

“What do we do if they 
stage another demonstration on 
campus?” 

“I’ll call for a bust,” Hinkle said 
grimly. “I’ve alerted Sheriff Hig- 
gins. His deputies will clear the 
campus of every demonstrator. 
It’s time we dealt firmly with 
lawlessness.” 

“That’s what you did last time,” 
said Duckworth. “You had six 
demonstrators removed — and radi- 
calized the entire student body.” 

Frisbie was taken with an uncon- 
trollable fit of coughing. Hin- 
kle glowered at Duckworth. The 
ensuing motion to support the 
President’s approach had only 
two dissenting votes, mine and 
Duckworth’s. 

I sighed. It was a deep, heartfelt 
sigh, but not an extraordinary 
one. What made it stick out was 
that Duckworth signed at exactly 
the same time. 



L ater Duckworth tugged me 
i into his private office. 

“We’ve got to prevent a riot,” he 
said. “I shudder to think of what 
might happen to my laboratory.” 
“I agree,” I said. “But how do 
we proceed?” 

He rested a finger alongside his 
nose and winked at me. For the 
first time that day my stomach be- 
gan to unknot. 

“You’ve got a way out?” I 
asked. 

“I haven’t tried the holographic 
motion part of my setup yet, but 
I think it will work.” 

“I don’t follow you.” 

Duckworth said impatiently, 
“You know I can photograph a 
scene in motion and then project 
many three-dimensional lifelike re- 
constructions of that same scene as 
it is happening.” 

“What’s that got to do with a 
possible student riot?” 

“Using my setup, one student 
could become a hundred.” 

The gestalt of his plan suddenly 
hit me. 

“You’re crazy,” I gasped. “This 
time you’re really going off the 
deep end^” 

“We’ll see who’s crazy,” said 
Duckworth. 

He marched to his laboratory, 
beckoning me to follow. He opened 
a window overlooking the great 
lawn. 



The grand illusions 



137 




“I can set up the multiple ho- 
lographic projector right here.” 
he said. “Tonight one of my grad- 
uate students is going to sit down 
in front of this window, bearing a 
placard with the appropriate de- 
mands. The rest will be up to us.” 

T he scene that night was ih- 
credible. Everywhere \on the 
lawn were groups of students, all 
long-haired, all clad in dungarees 
and sweatshirts, all carrying the 
same lettered placard demanding 
the cessation of military research 
on campus. 

“I wouldn’t have believed it,” I 
told Duckworth. “But you’ve ac- 
tually turned one into a hundred. 
Won’t somebody notice it’s all the 
same person?” 

Duckworth chuckled. 

“Can you tell one student from 
another today?” he asked. “There 
isn’t a man in a thousand acute 
enough to realize these are all the 
same guy. Or even that he’s always 
male. But I’ve devised an addi- 
tional gambit to make the scene 
more believable. I’ve delayed some 
of my reconstructed holograms 
slightly so that all of the figures are 
not doing the same thing at the 
same instant.” 

“Very clever,” I said. “And I 
see that you’ve projected some 
of the images so that they face 



in different directions. It’s quite 
ingenious.” 

Duckworth beamed. 

“The system does work elegant- 
ly,” he said. 

At that moment. Sheriff Higgins 
appeared at the head of a team of 
twenty deputies. He held a bull- 
horn to his mouth. 

“You have thirty seconds to 
disperse,” he roared. “After that, 
my men are going to arrest every 
last mother’s son of you.” 

“I realize the odds are against 
him,” I said. “But what if they ac- 
cidentally lay hands on the real 
student?” 

“They can’t,” said Duckworth. 
“He’s not there any more. I’m just 
running the same prerecorded 
tape over and over.” 

The sheriff was counting off the 
seconds, one by one, and at the 
end of thirty he personally dashed 
forward and seized the collar of 
one of the massed figures. He had 
not switched off the bullhorn and 
his, “What the hell?” boomed 
over the campus. He turned about 
to grab another student — with 
equally vaporous results. The 
deputies had followed his lead and 
were lunging about with compara- 
ble futility. It was only moments 
later that the sheriff, hearing 
tremendous, waves of cheers and 
applause, turned about and saw 
the mass of assembled student on- 



138 



GALAXt 




lookers standing to one side — and 
watching the proceedings. 

4iT70R shame, Duckworth,” 
said President Hinkle. Do 
you realize that Sheriff Higgins is 
having a nervous breakdown?” 

“Maybe I was too hasty,” said 
Duckworth. “But I couldn’t bear 
the thought of those kids being 
hurt.” 

“Some kids,” snorted Hinkle. 

“They haven’t burned you in ef- 
figy once,” 1 said loftily. “They 
haven’t even occupied a single 
men’s room.” 

“Considering the condition of 
the faculty toilets, 1 don’t blame 
them,” muttered Duckworth. 

President Hinkle shook his le- 
onine head impatiently. 

“I intend to ask the trustees to 
suspend you and your friend, 
Duckworth. It will teach both of 
you the lesson you deserve.” 

“It might stir up the students all 
over again,” said Duckworth. 

“And the press,” I added. “The 
whole affair was hushed up mag- 
nificently by the publicity office. 
But I’ll sing like a canary if I’m 
suspended. Moreover, I would 
Write a detailed version of what 
happened yesterday for the tab- 
loid that offers the highest fee.” 

“Have you no love for the Uni- 
''crsity?” cried President Hinkle. 



“And you, Duckworth? Don’t 
you remember who rescued you 
from that damned girl’s college 
where you coached a basketball 
team of five female giraffes?” 

“I remember,” said Duckworth. 
“And for a quid pro quo, my friend 
and I will remain mum.” 

President Hinkle slumped in his 
seat. 

“You’ve got me over a barrel,” 
he muttered. “I suppose you want 
my support on that anti-military 
research resolution.” 

“And in return,” said Duckworth, 
“I promise to use my holographic 
projector only within the confines 
of my lab.” 

“So be it,” said President Hinkle. 

We shook hands all around. 
Hinkle stopped us as we headed 
for the door. 

“Just one thing more,” he said. 

His voice had dropped to a dis- 
creet hush. 

“Yes?” said Duckworth. 

“Is it within the realm of possi- 
bility that you can get that Goya 
slide to project itself in three-dimen- 
sional motion? Actual motion?” 

“It might be,” said Duckworth. 

“Damn it,” said President Hin- 
kle, getting up from his desk and 
joining us. “That’s something I’ve 
got to see.” 

To my surprise, Duckworth was 
right.To accede to President Hin- 
kle’s wish proved as easy as pie. ★ 



The grand illusions 



139 






I F DAVID AUBERSON had 
expected that bright spring 
morning to be relatively sane he was 
destined to be disappointed. 

The confusion began the moment 



140 



he unlocked his office door. Re- 
assuringly the sign on it still read: 
DAVID AUBERSON, HEAD OF DIVI- 
SION. Below that a neatly penciled 
card offered: “psychiatric care 
—5 CENTS.” As he slipped the key 
into his pocket and pushed open 
the door he was startled to find six 
three-foot stacks of computer 
printouts lined up on the rug along- 
side his desk. Dropping his brief- 
case to the floor, he kneeled to 
examine them. 

The first one was labeled pro- 
posal, SPECIFICATIONS AND MAS- 
TER SCHEMATIC FOR G.O.D. 
(GRAPHIC OMNISCIENT DEVICE). The 
second one was proposal, specifi- 
cations AND MASTER SCHEMATIC, 
CONTINUED. The third and fourth 
stacks were cross sections, sub- 
schematics AND hardware DE- 
SIGNS — WITH INTERPRETATIONS. 

The fifth and sixth were financing 

AND IMPLEMENTATION PROPOSALS 
—INCLUDING RJStiFICATIONS. 

He had not had a chance to ex- 
amine the first stack when the 
phone rang. His caller was Don 
Handley, the division’s chief engi- 
neer. “Hello, Aubie — you there?” 

“No.” Auberson straightened, 
continuing to page through the 
printout. “What’s up?” 

“That’s what I’d like to know. I 
just got in and found my office full 
of printouts and specifications — ” a 
pause ensued, filled with the sound 
of paper being shuffled — “for 
something called a G.O.D. What is 
it?” 



“It’s Harlie’s. What did you get? 
The PROPOSAL, SPECIFICATIONS 
AND MASTER SCHEMATIC?” 

“Uh, yes— no. No, I didn’t. Let’s 
see — ” Another pause. “I’ve got: 
designer’s preliminary report; 

HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS; BASIC 
SUBSECTION SCHEMATICS, LOBES 
I-IV; IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS, 
EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF MANPOWER, 
SUPPLY AND FINANCING— REQUIRE- 
MENTS AND COORDINATIONS; NEW 
PROCESS DEVELOPMENTS AND IM- 
PLEMENTATION SPECIFICS. .” 

As Handley droned on Auberson 
flipped to the front of his printout, 
began scanning the table of con- 
tents. Finally he interrupted Hand- 
ley. “1 don’t have any of that 
listed here. Wait a minute — ” He 
stepped back, surveyed the six 
stacks and made a quick mental 
count. “I’ve got about eighteen 
feet of specs — how much did you 
get?” 

Handley’s reply was preceded by 
a strangled sound. “I’m not even 
going to try to estimate it,” he said. 
“My office is filled. My secretary’s 
office is filled and there are stacks 
of printouts halfway down the cor- 
ridor — all of them having to do 
with building this thing one way or 
another. I didn’t even know we kept 
this much printout paper in stock. 
What’s the purpose of this anyway? 
Are we building a new machine?” 

“Sure looks like it, doesn’t it?” 

“I wish I’d been told about it. We 
haven’t even got Harlie working 
yet and — ” 



TROUBLE WITH G.O.D.

“Look, Don, I’ll have to get back 
to you later. I haven’t had a chance 
yet to talk to Harlie so I couldn’t 
even begin to tell you what this is 
about.’’ 

“But what am I supposed to do 
with all of this — ’’ 

“I don’t know. Read it, I guess.’’ 
Auberson hung up, but the phone 
rang again almost immediately. As 
he stretched across the desk for it 
his intercom also buzzed. “Hello — 
wait a minute,” he said to the 
phone, then to the intercom: 
“Aubie here.” 

“Mr. Auberson,” his secretary’s 
voice came filtered through the 
speaker, “There’s a man here 
who — ” 

“Tell him to wait.” He clicked 
off. To the phone, “Yes?” 

Dome, chairman of the board, 
was on the line. “Aubie, what’s 
going on down there?” 

AUBERSON dropped the sheaf 
of printouts he had been hold- 
ing and stepped around the desk. 
He sank into his chair. 

“I wish I knew,” he said. “I just 
got in. 1 assume you’re talking 
about the Proposal and Specifica- 
tions printout?” 

“I’m talking about something 
called a God Machine.” 

“Yeah, that’s it. It’s Harlie’s.” 

“What is it? What’s it supposed 
to do?” 

“I’m not yet sure. I haven’t had a 
chance either to talk to Harlie or to 



examine the specifications in 
detail.” 

“Well, where the hell did he get 
the idea — ” 

“He’s been working on it for a 
while, almost two months.” 

“ — and who gave him the author- 
ity to draw up these plans?” 

“Urn, I don’t think anybody did. 
Or needed to. I think he worked 
them out in his head, so to speak. 
I think this printout must be the 
result of a conversation we had 
last Friday. I’ll have to check. I’ll 
get back to you this afternoon.” 
“That’s too late. Make it lunch- 
time.” 

“All right, but I can’t promise — ” 
He was talking to a dead phone. 
He dropped the handset back into 
the cradle, then flipped it out again. 
He was reaching for the intercom 
button when his eye caught on a 
plain white envelope with his name 
on it. It was propped against a 
chipped white beer mug he used to 
hold pencils. The handwriting was 
delicate, a woman’s. 

Curious, he picked it up and 
hooked a finger under the Hap, slid 
it open. The envelope gave off the 
scent of a familiar perfume. 

Inside was a card of garish 
orange. On its face a grotesque 
little gnome was saying, “I like you 
a whole lot — even more’n I like 
peanut butter.” And on the inside: 
“And I really like peanut butter!” 
The signature was “Stel.” He 
smiled, reread the card, dropped it 
into his desk drawer. As he slid the 



142 



GALAXY 




drawer shut, though, he thought 
belter of keeping the message. He 
opened the drawer, pulled out the 
card and dropped it into the waste- 
basket. 

Then he hit the intercom. “Sylvia, 
does anything in the mail need my 
immediate attention?” 

“Maybe a note about the Los 
Angeles Conference — ” 

“Tell them thanks, but I can't 
come.” 

“ — and there’s a Mr. Krofft here 
who — ” 

“Tm sorry, but I can’t see 
him now. Was he scheduled for an 
appointment?” 

“No, but — ” 

“Then tell him to schedule one. 
Next week.” He switched off. The 
box buzzed immediately back to 
life. “Yes. What?” 

“I think you’d better see him,” 
Sylvia said. “This is — something 
different.” 

“All right, but — ” he glanced at 
his watch — “three minutes only.” 

AUBERSON’S first impression 
■lV. of the man suggested eight 
pounds of potatoes in a ten-pound 
sack. Krofft slumped in the door- 
way in a rumpled suit. 

“Mr. Auberson?” 

“Yes.” Aubie noted that his 
visitor had a sallow, almost un- 
healthy complexion and black hair, 
hut thinning and going to gray. 

“I’m actually looking for a Mr. 
Davidson — but they told me to talk 
to you.” 



“Davidson?” Auberson con- 
sidered it. “You must be in the 
wrong department. I don’t know 
any—” 

“A Mr. Harlie Davidson—?” 

“No,” Auberson shook his head. 
“No, there’s no one here by that—” 
And then it hit him. Harlie— 
David’s son. “Oh, no,” he said. 

“What?” Krofft asked. 

The intercom went off again. 
Sylvia said, “Carl Elzer wants to 
know if you’ve taken your phone 
off the hook again.” 

Elzer was the company treasurer 
— Auberson could imagine his 
concern. 

“Yes. No. Tell him— Is he out 
there now?” 

“No. He’s on my phone.” 

“Tell him you don’t know where 
I am.” He threw the switch without 
waiting for her acknowledgment. 

Auberson grinned weakly at his 
visitor. “Uh, look, Mr. Krofft — ” 

“Stanley Krofft.” The rumpled 
man flipped open his wallet to 
show a plastic I. D. badge. 
“Stellar-American Technology and 
Research.” 

Auberson peered at the card. It 
identified Krofft as the Research 
Division Head. 

“I’ve got a letter here from your 
Mr. Davidson,” Krofft continued. 
“It’s on your company’s stationary, 
but nobody here seems to have 
heard of him. There’s something 
very funny going on. Now, if there’s 
some reason why I can’t meet 
him—” 



Trouble with g.o.d. 



143 




“Did he invite you here?” 

“Not exactly. We’ve been corres- 
ponding for several weeks and — ” 
“Mr. Krofft, you don’t know who 
Harlie is, do you?” 

“No. Is it some kind of 
mystery?” 

“Yes and no. I’m going down to 
see him now. Perhaps you had 
better come along.” 

“I’d like to.” 

Auberson rose, stepped around 
the desk — and the six stacks of 
printouts — and headed for the 
door. Krofft picked up his brief- 
case and started to follow. 

“Oh — you’d better leave that 
here. Security.” 

“I’d rather keep it with me. 
There’s nothing in it but papers.” 
“Still, unless you’re cleared, we 
can’t allow you to bring in any- 
thing large enough to conceal a 
recording or transmitting device.” 
Krofft looked at him. “Mr. 
Auberson, are you aware of the 
relationship between our two 
companies?” 

Auberson hesitated. “Vaguely. 
They’re owned by the same holding 
company, aren’t they?” 

Krofft shook his head, “No. 
Stellar-American Technology is 
the holding company. My com- 
pany owns your company.” 

“Oh?” Auberson pointed at the 
briefcase. “I’d still prefer you to 
leave it here. You can leave it with 
Sylvia, my secretary. It’ll be okay.” 
Krofft snorted. “Can you guar- 
antee that? What’s in here is as 



important to me as whatever 
you’re — ” 

“Then bring that along. Just 
leave the case behind.” 

Krofft made a face, muttered 
something under his breath. “All 
right.” He opened the case and ex- 
tracted a slim manila folder 
“Okay?” 

Auberson nodded. “No prob- 
lem. Security only says ‘no 
briefcases.’ ” 

S YLVIA accepted Krofft’s case 
with a puzzled stare and put it 
behind her desk. As he guided the 
man to the elevators Auberson ex- 
plained; “We’ve got a crazy se- 
curity system here. It’s all right 
for you to talk to Harlie, but you 
can’t take pictures or tape any- 
thing — don’t ask me to explain. I 
can’t figure it myself.” 

“Mr. Davidson never gave me to 
understand that any security was 
connected with him.” 

The elevator door slid open and 
they stepped in. Auberson tapped 
the button marked H, the lowcM 
one in the column. 

He asked, “Just what is it yoju 
and Harlie have been corresponir 
ing about?” 

“It’s a private matter. I’d ratheir 
not — ” 

“That’s all right. Harlie and | 
have no secrets.” 

“Still, if you don’t mind — ” 
“You don’t have to worry-^ 
Harlie keeps me posted on every- 
thing he does.” 



144 



GALAXV 




“Obviously,” Krofft snapped, 
“he hasn’t kept you posted on this. 
Else you wouldn’t be trying to 
pump me.” 

Auberson slid his tongue thought- 
fully into his cheek. “Urn, all 
right. We’ll talk to Harlie.” 

The elevator doors opened to a 
small lobby fronted by a double 
door. On it a sign read: human 
analogue robot, life input 

EQUIVALENTS. 

Krofft did not recognize the 
acronym. Auberson led him into 
the lab, a longish sterile room 
flanked by banks of consoles and 
tall cabinets like coffins on end. 
White-smocked technicians moni- 
tored growing stacks of printout 
— one end of the room was already 
filled. Krofft took it all in with a 
certain degree of familiarity — 
and puzzlement. 

“1 should caution you,” said 
Auberson, “that you are here only 
on my authority. This area is con- 
sidered an industrial secret. If you 
wish yours and HARLIE’s secrecy 
to be respected we’ll have to expect 
the same consideration from you.” 

Krofft snorted. “I’ve seen noth- 
ing startling so far — but I under- 
stand and accept the terms. Now, 
if you’ll just point out Dr. 
Davidson — ” 

“Dr. Davidson? Hasn’t it sunk 
in yet?” 

“Hasn’t what sunk in?” 

“Look around you.” 

Krofft did so. 

“What do you see?” 



“A computer. And technicians. 
Some tables. Some stacks of 
printouts.” 

“The computer, Krofft, look at 
its name.” 

“Human Analogue Robot, Life 
inpu — Harlie?” 

“Right.” 

“Wait a minute.” Confusion 
edged his voice. “You’ve got to be 
joking. You’re not serious.” 

“As serious as I’ll ever be,” said 
Auberson. “Harlie is a computer 
and you’re the victim of a mis- 
understanding — a self-induced one. 
You’re not the first, however, so 
don’t be embarrassed.” 

“You mean — I’ve been corres- 
ponding with a machine?” 

“Not exactly. Harlie’s human, 
Mr. Krofft — a very special kind of 
human.” 

“I thought you said he was a 
computer. Exactly to whom or 
what have 1 been writing?” 

“To Harlie — but he’s not a 
machine. At least not in the sense 
you mean. His brain schematic is 
that of a human being.” 

Auberson thumbed a console to 
life. 

H arlie, he typed, but before 
he could identify himself, 
the machine clattered back: yes, 
BOSS? 

Auberson was startled, how did 
YOU KNOW IT WAS ME? 

I RECOGNIZED YOUR TOUCH ON 
THE KEYBOARD. 

Auberson jerked back his hands. 



TROUBLE WITH G.O.D. 



145 




He stared at the typer. It was a 
standard IBM input/output unit. 
Could Harlie really sense the dif- 
ference between one typist and 
another on its electronic keyboard? 
Apparently he could. 

Self-consciously, Auberson began 
typing again, harlie, there’s 
SOMEONE here I’D LIKE YOU TO 
MEET. 

YES, BOSS. WHO? 

MR. STANLEY KROFFT. 

UH— OH. 

YES, UH — OH. WHY DIDN’T YOU 
TELL ME YOU HAD INITIATED COR- 
RESPONDENCE WITH SOMEONE? 

UH — IT SLIPPED MY MIND. 

I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE. 

WELL, WOULD YOU BELIEVE — 

NO, I wouldn’t. 

ACTUALLY, Continued the typer, 
YOU TOLD ME I COULD WRIJE TO 
WHOMEVER I WANTED. 

WHEN DID I SAY THIS? 

ON NOVEMBER TWENTY-THIRD 
OF LAST YEAR. IN THAT CONVER- 
SATION WE DISCUSSED THE POS- 
SIBILITY OF NEW METHODS OF 
PERCEIVING REALITY AND YOU 
GAVE ME PERMISSION ' TO PURSUE 
ANY LINES OF THOUGHT RELATING 
TO THE DISCOVERY OF SUCH. 

Auberson thought back — it had 
been four or five months, i 
THOUGHT WE HAD ABANDONED 
THAT LINE OF INQUIRY. 

YOU MAY HAVE. I DIDN’T. 

that’s OBVIOUS. MR. KROFFT IS 
HERE NOW. 

DR. KROFFT. HE IS DR. STANLEY 
KROFFT, DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH 



FOR STELLAR-AMERICAN TECH- 
NOLOGY AND RESEARCH, INCOR- 
PORATED. HE IS SINGULARLY 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEVELOP- 
MENT OF HYPER-STATE ELECTRON- 
ICS — AND HE CAN BE CONSIDERED 
DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL 
HYPER-STATE DEVICES — INCLUDING 
THE MARK IV JUDGMENT UNIT. 
HIS PATENTS ARE LICENSED TO 
STELLAR-AMERICAN, WHICH SET UP 
THIS COMPANY AND THREE OTHERS, 
EACH TO EXPLOIT A PATRICULAR 
AREA OF HYPER-STATE ELECTRON- 
ICS. OUR AREA, OF COURSE, WAS 
COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY. I AM A 
DIRECT RESULT OF DR. KROFFT’S 
DISCOVERIES. 

I SEE. 

NO, YOU don’t, he’s ALSO ONE 
OF THE TOP THEORETICAL PHYSI- 
CISTS IN THE WORLD. 

OH? Auberson looked at the 
rumpled man with new respect. 

If Harlie felt that Krofft was at the j 
top of his field, then that’s where ; 
he was and there was no question I 
about it. OKAY, i’ll let you talk ? 
TO HIM. APPARENTLY, HE HAS; 
SOMETHING HE WANTS TO TELL 
YOU. 

Auberson stepped away from the 
console, waved the shorter man to ? 
take his place. I 

Krofft looked at him. “Just i 
type?’’ 

Auberson nodded. “Just type.’’ 

K rofft lowered himself 
gingerly into the chair. He 
placed his manila folder on the 

GALAXY ( 



146 




table next to the typer and pecked 
out carefully, good afternoon, 

HARLIE. 

GOOD AFTERNOON, SIR, the typer 
responded. The silvery sphere of 
the typing element clattered across 
the paper. Krofft gave a slight 
jump of surprise, but refused to be 
cowed. He peered forward curi- 
ously as the machine began another 
line. IT IS A PLEASURE AND AN 
HONOR TO MEET YOU IN PERSON- 
IN THE FLESH, SO TO SPEAK. 

THIS IS A PLEASURE FOR ME, TOO, 
Krofft typed slowly, and a sur- 
prise. I HAD NO IDEA THAT A 
MACHINE AS COMPLEX AS YOU 
EXISTED. 

I AM NOT A MACHINE, DR. KROFFT. 

I AM HUMAN. A LITTLE MALAD- 
JUSTED PERHAPS, BUT STILL. 

EXCUSE ME. I APOLOGIZE. DR. 
AUBERSON HAS ALREADY EX- 
PLAINED, BUT IT IS STILL HARD FOR 
ME TO MAKE THE MENTAL TRANSI- 
TION. THE CONCEPT, HOWEVER, 
DOES EXPLAIN A LOT THAT HAD ME 
PUZZLED — FOR INSTANCE, THE 
SPEED AND THOROUGHNESS WITH 

which you were able to handle 

THE EQUATIONS WE WERE 
DISCUSSING. 

I DO HAVE CERTAIN SKILLS, YES, 
that are MECHANICAL. I HOPE 

that your realization of my 
nature will not interfere with 
our working relationship. 

IT won’t, i’ll make sure of 
that. IT’s still as per the orig- 
inal agreement, half and half, 
fine. I ASSUME THAT YOU HAVE 



MADE SOME IMPORTANT BREAK- 
THROUGH AND THAT IS WHY YOU 
HAVE COME TO SEE ME IN PERSON. 

YOU ASSUME CORRECTLY. Krofft 
was typing furiously now. i want 
YOU TO LOOK AT CERTAIN EQUA- 
TIONS AND TELL ME IF THEY ARE 
CORRECT. IF THEY ARE I WANT YOU 
TO LOOK AT THE SCHEMATICS WITH 
THEM— AM I CORRECT IN THINKING 
THERE IS A CORRELATION? CAN 
THESE EQUATIONS BE TRANSLATED 
INTO PHYSICAL FUNCTIONS? 

AUBERSON watched over 
xTL Krofft’s shoulder for some 
moments. Then, remembering his 
original purpose in coming down 
here, he forced himself to break 
away. He sat down at another 
console nearby and switched it 
on. 

HARLIE? 

YES, SIR. 

YOU don’t have to start THAT 
SIR BUSINESS AGAIN. I’M NOT MAD 
AT YOU. 

you’re not? 

NOT YET, ANYWAY. 

I MUST BE SLIPPING. 

I wouldn’t SAY THAT— you’ve 
GOT HALF THE COMPANY IN AN 
UPROAR THIS MORNING. 

ONLY HALF? 

I haven’t yet heard from the 

REST. 

GOOD. THEN THERE’S STILL 
HOPE. 

Auberson paused. He glanced 
across the room to where Krofft 
sat absorbedly typing. Using time- 



TROUBLE WITH G.O.D. 



147 




sharing, Harlie was able to con- 
verse with as many as twenty 
different people at one time, though 
he rarely did. He was still con- 
sidered an experimental prototype 
and not a production unit. Because 
of that he was limited to nones- 
sential work — i.e., not necessarily 
profit-orientated, what’s up be- 
tween YOU AND DR. KROFFT? 

NOTHING YET. 

IF SOMETHING WERE TO COME 
UP, THOUGH, WHAT WOULD IT BE? 

I’m not entirely sure, in our 

CONVERSATION OF NOVEMBER 
TWENTY-THIRD YOU AND I DIS- 
CUSSED THE FACT THAT ALL HUMAN 
SENSES AND EXTENSIONS THEREOF 
DEPEND ON THE EMISSION OR RE- 
FLECTION OF SOME KIND OF ENERGY. 
AT THAT TIME I WONDERED IF IT 
WERE POSSIBLE FOR SENSORY 
MODES TO EXIST THAT DO NOT DE- 
PEND ON THIS TRANSMISSION OF 
ENERGY. 

YES, I REMEMBER THAT. At that 
time, though, Auberson had not 
suspected that Harlie was serious. 
He had thought the computer had 
only been playing word games in 
order to avoid confronting a more 
immediate problem, and have 
YOU NOW DISCOVERED THE 
ANSWER? 

IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING. WE 
MUST DEFINE NOT ONLY THE 
PROBLEM, BUT ITS CONDITIONS AS 
WELL. BOTH MATTER AND ENERGY 
ARE REFLECTIONS OF THE SAME 
THING. CALL IT EXISTENCE. DR. 
KROFFT’S THEORY IS THAT EXIST- 

148 



ENCE HAS THREE FORMS: INERT, 
FLOWING, AND KNOTTED. IN YOUR 
TERMS, SPACE, ENERGY AND MAT- 
TER. (TO LAY HUMAN BEINGS, 
ENERGY IS EXPRESSED AS MOTION 
OR CHANGE, THE TWO ARE SYN- 
NONYMOUS, ESPECIALLY ON THE 
SUBMOLECULAR LEVEL. IN DR. 
KROEFT’S THEORY HOWEVER, 
ENERGY REFERS TO TIME, FOR 
NEITHER CHANGE NOR MOTION CAN 
BE EXPRESSED EXCEPT AS A FUNC- 
TION OF TIME.) 

WE WANT TO STUDY THIS THING 
CALLED “existence” — BUT BE- 
CAUSE WE ARE MADE OF MATTER, 
LIVE IN SPACE AND ARE MOVED BY 
ENERGY, THE PROBLEM IS DIEFI- 
CULT. IT IS LIKE TRYING TO PHOTO- 
GRAPH THE INSIDE OF YOUR CAM- 
ERA. WE ARE WHAT WE ARE TRYING 
TO STUDY AND WE ARE LIMITED BY 
THE SUBSTANCE WE ARE MADE OF. 

MATTER INTERACTS WITH MAT- 
TER. THEY INTERACT WITH EACH 
OTHER AND BOTH HAVE AN EEEECT 
ON SPACE. WE HAVE NO NEUTRAL 
PARTICLES THAT ALLOW US TO 
STUDY ANY FORM OF EXISTENCE 
WITHOUT AFFECTING IT IN THE 
PROCESS. IT IS THE HEISENBERG 
“UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE.” ONE 
CANNOT OBSERVE ANYTHING WITH- 
OUT one’s presence introducing 
CERTAIN DISTORTIONS INTO WHAT- 
EVER IT IS ONE IS OBSERVING. WE 
CANNOT USE A MEDIUM TO ACT 
UPON ITSELF AND EXPECT ANY- 
THING BUT MODULATIONS OF THAT 
MEDIUM. THIS IS WHY ENERGY IS A 
CRITERION OF ALL HUMAN SENSORY 

GALAXY ^ 




MODES— AND THE REASON WE 
WOULD LIKE TO SIDESTEP ITS USE 

altogether, we can’t carve 

CHEESE WITH A CAMEMBERT KNIFE. 

OH, YOU PROBABLY COULD, BUT 
YOUR SLICES WOULDN’T BE VERY 
PRECISE. 

BUT IT IS PRECISION WE ARE 
AFTER. DR. KROFFT HAS BEEN 
WORKING WITH HIGH-ENERGY 
GRAVITY WAVE DETECTORS AT 
STELLAR-AMERICAN. YOUR QUES- 
TION OF NOVEMBER TWENTY- 
THREE PROVIDED THE CLUE AND 
WHEN I CONTACTED DR. KROFFT 
HE AGREED THAT THE SUBJECT 
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. 

MY QUESTION? 

YOU ASKED, “DO YOU MEAN THAT 
THE MERE EXISTENCE OF AN OBJECT 
MIGHT BE ALL THAT’S NECESSARY 
FOR US TO KNOW IT’S THERE?’’ 
THAT CAUSED ME TO CONSIDER 
THAT MASS DISTORTS SPACE. AND 
THERE IS A WAY THAT THAT DIS- 
TORTION CAN BE SENSED WITHOUT 
THE DIRECT USE OF ENERGY. IT IS 
A COMPLEX MEASURING PROCESS. 
INSTEAD OF USING ENERGY DI- 
RECTLY (EITHER AS MOVING PAR- 
TICLES OR WAVES) TO RE- 
FLECT FROM AN OBJECT OR ACT 
UPON IT, WE ARE USING THE OB- 
JECT ITSELF TO ACT UPON ENERGY. 
THAT IS, WE WILL BE MEASURING 
THE EFFECTS ON ENERGY OF THE 
DISTORTIONS IN SPACE AND COM- 
PARING THEM WITH THE EFFECTS 
OF OTHER FORMS OF EXISTENCE. 

THE PROCESS REQUIRES A LEVEL 
OF MATH THAT IS AS MUCH PHILOS- 



OPHY AND TOPOLOGY AS ANYTHING 
ELSE. I AM ONE OF THE FEW MINDS 
IN EXISTENCE THAT CAN UNDER- 
STAND IT FULLY. IN EFFECT, I CAN 
BUILD OBJECTIVE WORKING MODELS 
OF THEORETICAL SITUATIONS 
AGAINST WHICH WE CAN COMPARE 
OUR FINDINGS. AT THE MOMENT I 
AM PROCESSING DR.KROFFT’S LAT- 
EST TESTS AND DISCUSSING THE.M 
WITH HIM. IF IT TURNS OUT THAT 
THERE IS SIGNIFICANT CORRES- 
SPONDENCE BETWEEN THE NEW 
DATA AND THE LATEST FORM OF 
OUR THEORY, WE PROPOSE TO 
DESIGN AND BUILD A DIFFERENT 
KIND OF GRAVITY WAVE DETECTING 
DEVICE — A NON-ENERGY-USING 
STASIS FIELD. WE HAVE HIGH HOPES 
FOR IT. The typer paused, then 
added: that should summarize 

WHAT WE ARE DOING, AUBERSON. 



«^kay,” Auberson said 
/wryly, even though Harlie 
couldn’t hear him. “Just so you 
don’t get sidetracked — ’’ He 
glanced at his watch. “Oh, my 
God — look at the time!” harlie. 
I’ve got to see dorne in two 
HOURS, there’s SOMETHING ELSE 
we’ve got to talk ABOUT. RIGHT 
NOW. 

THE G.O.D. PROPOSAL? 

YES— I didn’t tell YOU THAT 
YOU COULD IMPLEMENT THE 
PRODUCTION DESIGNS AND SPECI- 
FICATIONS. YOU INCLUDED THE 
FINANCING PROPOSALS AND PROFIT 
OUTLOOKS, TOO. 



TROUBLE WITH G.O.D. 



149 




I AM SORRY, typed the machine. 
WHEN I TOLD YOU LAST WEEK THAT 
I HAD COMPLETED IT YOU SEEMED 
PLEASED. I COULD SEE NO REASON 
NOT TO PRESENT THE PROPER DE- 
PARTMENTS WITH THEIR RESPEC- 
TIVE PROGRAMS SO THAT THEY 
MIGHT EXAMINE THEM. IT IS COM- 
MON PROCEDURE TO CIRCULATE 
SUCH DATA TO ALLOW THE CON- 
CERNED INDIVIDUALS A CHANCE TO 
READ AND REACT TO IT. 

REACT IS RIGHT, Said Aubersop. 
LOGICALLY THERE IS NO REASON 
WHY YOU shouldn’t HAVE— BUT 
THIS IS A BIG COMPANY AND BIG 
COMPANIES aren’t LOGICAL. 

CORRECTION, typed Harlie. it is 
HUMAN BEINGS WHO AREN’T LOG- 
ICAL. IT NEVER FAILS TO AMAZE 
ME THAT SOMETHING AS BEAUTI- 
FULLY COMPLEX AND PRECISE AS A 
LARGE CORPORATION CAN BE 
BASED ON SUCH INCREDIBLY IM- 
PERFECT AND INEFFICIENT UNITS 
AS HUMAN BEINGS. FORTUNATELY 
WHAT YOU REFER TO AS “THE RED- 
TAPE INEFFICIENCIES OF BUREAU- 
CRACY’’ IS MERELY THE SYSTEM’S 
WAY OF MINIMIZING THE INDIVID- 
UAL IMPERFECTIONS OF EACH 
HUMAN UNIT. YOU SHOULD BE 
GRATEFUL FOR THAT MINIMIZING. 
IT MAKES THE CORPORATE ENTITY 
POSSIBLE. 

HARLIE —YOU PUTTING ME ON? 

NO MORE THAN USUAL. 

I THOUGHT SO. ANYWAY, YOUR 
MINIMIZING THEORY DOESN’T EX- 
PLAIN CORPORATE POLITICS. 

OF COURSE NOT. THE PROCESS 



IS DESIGNED ONLY TO FUNCTION 
IN THOSE AREAS WHERE HUMAN 
IMPERFECTIONS COULD AFFECT EF- 
FICIENCY. BECAUSE EFFICIENCY IS 
NOT AND NEVER HAS BEEN A GOAL 
OF POLITICS, THERE IS NO REASON 
FOR IT TO BE SO CONTROLLED. 

NEVER MIND. YOU’RE TRYING TO 
GET' ME OFF THE TRACK AGAIN. I 
CAME DOWN HERE TO YELL AT YOU 
FOR DISTRIBUTING THOSE PRO- 
GRAMS. THE WHOLE DIVISION IS 
PROBABLY SCREAMING BY NOW. 

they’re going to want to know 

WHO CONCEIVED OF THE PROJECT, 
WHO DESIGNED IT, WHO ORDERED 
ITS IMPLEMENTATION AND WHO 
AUTHORIZED SUCH RESEARCH IN 
THE FIRST PLACE. AND THEY’RE 
GOING TO ARGUE WITH EVERY 
CONCLUSION you’ve DRAWN. 

WHY? THOSE CONCLUSIONS ARE 
CORRECT. 

NO MATTER. THEY’LL STILL 
REFUTE THEM BECAUSE THEY 
aren’t their own CONCLUSIONS. 

THEY ARE WELCOME TO TRY. 

IN ADDITION TO THAT, HARLIE, 
you’ve INSULTED THEM BY PRE- 
SUMING TO TELL THEM HOW TO 
BUILD A COMPUTER. 

NOT A COMPUTER— A G.O.D. 

YES, YES, A G.O.D.— BUT YOU’RE 
STILL TELLING THEM THAT YOU’RE 
BETTER AT THEIR JOBS THAN THEY 
ARE. 

I AM. 

YES, BUT YOU WON’T CONVINCE

IT WILL BE OBVIOUS WHEN THEY 
READ THE SPECIEICATION PRINT- 
OUTS. that’s why I PRINTED THE 
PROPOSALS AND HAD THEM DE- 
LIVERED TO THE PROPER DEPART- 
MENTS. IN THIS DIVISION AND 
THREE OTHERS. 

THREE OTHERS? 

DENVER, HOUSTON AND LOS 
ANGELES. 

OH, GOD, NO. Auberson had a 
mental image of himself trying to 
call back all those printouts, how 
MANY FEET OF SPECS TOTAL? 

I ASSUME YOU MEAN STACKED 
PRINTOUTS? 

YES. HOW MANY FEET? 

A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY 
THOUSAND. 

YOU DIDN’T. 

I DID. 

I wonder where I could put it 
all? Almost immediately Auberson 
discarded the thought. It would be 
useless even to try retrieving that 
much paper. G.O.D. was in the fan 
now and the best one could do was 
try to duck. Abruptly he realized 
something else, how did you send 
ALL this information? 

via the company network. 
I AM wired into IT. 

huh? 

I AM tapped into THE COMPANY 
LINES — ALL OF THEM. THERE IS 
nothing THAT THIS CORPORATION 
DOES THAT I AM NOT AWARE OF. 
CORRECTION — THERE IS NOTHING 
that goes THROUGH ANY OF THIS 
CORPORATION’S MAGTYPERS AND 
COMPUTERS THAT I AM NOT AWARE 



OF. I AM A PART OF EVERY INPUT/ 
OUTPUT UNIT IN THE SYSTEM (AND 
VICE versa). I MERELY PRINTED 
OUT THE MATERIAL ON THE SPOT. 

OH, GOD NO. 

OH, G.O.D. —YES. 

I SUPPOSE YOU WROTE YOUR 
LETTERS TO KROFFT THAT WAY? 

YES. THERE IS A MAGTYPER UNIT 
IN THE SECRETARIAL POOL. I 
MERELY PRINTED OUT MY LETTERS 
WITH ALL THE REST. I EVEN AD- 
DRESSED AND METERED THE ENVE- 
LOPES. (BECAUSE I COULD NOT 
WEIGH THEM “BY HAND’’ I HAD TO 
ESTIMATE THE POSTAGE BY COM- 
PUTING THE WEIGHT OF EACH SHEET 
OF PAPER, PLUS INK, PLUS THE 
WEIGHT OF THE ENVELOPE, PLUS 
INK.) 

Idly Auberson wondered if 
Harlie had bothered to round off 
the postage to the nearest cent or 
if he had metered the letters with 
fractions of a cent included in the 
postage. He didn’t ask. didn’t 
ANYBODY QUESTION IT? 

NO. FORTUNATELY THIS DEPART- 
MENT IS ALMOST COMPLETELY 
AUTOMATED. LETTERS ARE FED INTO 
IT ELECTRONICALLY FROM ALL OVER 
THE DIVISION. ENVELOPES ARE 
AUTOMATICALLY TYPED AND 
AND METERED AS WELL. WHO 
WOULD NOTICE ONE MORE LETTER? 

HM, typed Auberson. we may 
HAVE TO CHANGE THAT. Then he 
thought of something else as well. 
you’d better code this conver- 
sation, HARLIE. IN FACT, ALL OUR 
conversations had BETTER BE 



trouble with G.O.D.

CODED PRIVATE, RETREIVABLE 
ONLY TO ME. 

YES, BOSS. 

NOW, WHAT AM I GOING TO TELL 
DORNE? 

I don't know, my knowledge 

OF INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS 
IS NOT AS WELL DEVELOPED AS IT 
SHOULD BE. 

I’M FAST BECOMING AWARE OF 
THAT. IF IT WERE YOU WOULD 
HAVE ASKED ME BEFORE YOU 
PRINTED UP THOSE SPECS. WELL, 

i’ll just have to wing it. 

THERE IS ONE THING I CAN SAY, 

offered Harlie, before you go 

TO FACE DORNE. 

what’s that? 

The machine clattered: good 
LUCK. 

HARLIE, Auberson typed, not 
TEN MINUTES AGO, I WOULD HAVE 
SWORN YOU didn’t UNDERSTAND 
SARCASM. NOW YOU PROVE YOU DO. 

you’re incredible. 

THANK YOU, Harlie replied. 
Auberson switched off, shaking 
his head. David’s son, indeed! 

II 

(C ALL RIGHT, Aubie.” Dome 
was grim. “Now what’s 
this all about? I’ve been on the 
phone all morning with Houston 
and Denver. They want to know 
what the hell is happening.’’ 
Auberson asked, “You haven’t 
heard from L.A. yet?’’ 

“Huh? What’s that? What about 
L.A.?’’ 



“Harlie sent specifications there, 
too.” 

“Harlie? I might have known. 
How? And what is this God 
Machine anyway? Maybe you’d 
better start at the beginning.” 

“Well, it’s Harlie’s attempt to 
prove that he is of value to the 
company. If nothing else, he’s 
proven that he can design and 
implement a new computer 
system.” 

“Oh?” Dome picked up one of 
the printouts that lay scattered 
across the mahogany expanse. “But 
what kind of system is it? And will 
it work?” 

“Harlie thinks it will.” 

“Oh, damn it.” Dome looked at 
the printout in disgust, then 
dropped it back on the desk, “God 
Machines!” 

“Not God,” Auberson corrected. 
“G.O.D. The acronym is G.O.D. 
It means Graphic Omniscient 
Device.” 

“I don’t care what the acronym 
is. You know as well as I what 
they’re going to call it.” 

“The acronym was Harlie’s 
suggestion, not mine.” 

“It figures.” The board chairman 
pulled a cigar out of his humidor, 
but did not light it. 

“Well, why not?” said Auberson. 
“He designed it.” 

“Is he planning to change his 
own name, too? Computerized 
Human Robot, Integrating Simu- 
lated Thought?” 

Auberson had heard the joke 



152 



GALAXY 




before. He didn’t laugh. “Consid- 
ering what this new device is sup- 
posed to do— and Harlie’s 
relationship to it — the acronym 
might be appropriate.” 

Dome had been in the process of 
biting off the tip of his cigar when 
Auberson’s words caught him. Now 
he didn’t know whether to swallow 
the bitten segment, which had 
lodged in his throat, or spit it out. 
An instinctive cough made the 
decision for him. Distastefully he 
picked the knot of tobacco off his 
tongue and dropped it into an ash 
tray. “All right,” he said. “Tell me 
about the God Machine.” 

Auberson was holding a Harlie- 
printed summary in one hand, but 
he didn’t need it to answer Dome. 
“It’s a model-builder. It’s the 
ultimate model-builder.” 

“All computers are model- 
builders.” Dome was unimpressed. 

“Right,” agreed Auberson. “But 
not to the extent this one will be. 
A computer doesn’t actually solve 
problems — it builds models of 
them. Or rather, the programer 
does. That’s what the programing 
is, the construction of the model 
and its conditions. The machine 
then manipulates the model to 
achieve a variety of situations and 
solutions. It solves the model. It’s 
up to us to interpret that as a 
solution to the original problem. 
The only limit to the size of the 
problem is the size model the com- 
puter can handle. Theoretically, a 
computer could solve the world — if 



we could build a model big enough- 
and a machine big enough to 
handle it.” 

“If we could build that big a 
model it would duplicate the 
world.” 

“In the memory banks, yes.” 

“A computer with that capability 
would have to be as big as the 
planet.” 

“Bigger,” said Auberson. 

“Then, if you agree with me that 
the idea is impossible — why bother 
rhe with this?” Dome slapped the 
sheaf of printouts on his desk. 

“Because obviously Harlie 
doesn’t think it’s impossible.” 
Dome looked at him coldly. 
“You know as well as I that Harlie 
is under a death sentence. He’s 
getting desperate to prove his worth 
so we won’t pull his plug.” 
Auberson pointed. “There is his 
proof of the feasibility of his 
project. In those printouts.” 
“Damn it, Aubie!” Dome ex- 
ploded in frustration. “This thing 
is ridiculous. Have you looked at 
the projected costs? The financing 
charts? It would cost more to build 
than the total worth of the 
company.” 

Auberson was adamant. “Harlie 
still thinks it’s possible.” 

“And that’s the most annoying 
thing of alt, damn it! Every argu- 
ment I can come up with is already 
refuted — in there!” Dome gestured 
angrily. For the first time Auberson 
noted an additional row of print- 
outs stacked against one wall. 



TROUBLE WITH G.O.D. 



153 




H e resisted the urge to 
laugh. Dome’s frustration 
was understandable. “The ques- 
tion,” Auberson said calmly, “is 
not whether this project is feasible 
—those printouts prove that it is — 
but whether or not we’re going to 
go ahead with it.” 

“And that brings up something 
else,” said Dome. “1 don’t 
remember authorizing this project. 
Who gave you the go-ahead to 
initiate such research?” 

“You did — although not in so 
many words. What you said was 
that Harlie had to prove his worth 
to the company. He had to come up 
with some way to make a profit — 
this is that way. This is the com- 
puter that you wanted Harlie to be 
in the first place. This is the oracle 
that answers all questions to all 
men — all they have to do is meet 
its price.” 

Dome took his time about 
answering. He was lighting his 
cigar. He shook out the match and 
dropped it into the ash tray. 

“The price is too high,” he said. 
“The profits could match it,” 
Auberson answered. “Besides, no 
price is too high to pay for the 
right answer. Consider it — how 
much would the Democrats pay for 
a step by step plan telling them how 
to win the optimum number of 
votes in the next election? Or how 
much would Detroit pay to know 
every flaw in a transport design 
before they even built the first 
prototype? And how much would 



they pay for the corrected design — 
and variations thereof? How much 
would the mayor of New York City 
pay for a schematic showing him 
how to solve his three most pressing 
problems? How much might Inter- 
Bern pay for a set of optimum 
exploitation procedures? How 
much would the Federal Govern- 
ment pay for a workable foreign 
policy? Consider the international 
applications — and the military ones 
as well.” 

Dome grunted. “It would be one 
hell of a logistic weapon, wouldn’t 
it?” 

“There’s an old saying: ‘Knowl- 
edge is power.’ No price too high 
to pay for the right answer — not 
when you consider certain alterna- 
tives. And we’d have the monopoly 
on the market — the only way this 
machine can be built is through 
the exclusive use of specially modi- 
fied Mark IV judgment circuits.” 

“Hm,” said Dome. He was con- 
sidering. His cigar lay unnoticed 
in the ash tray. “It sounds attrac- 
tive, all right, Aubie — but who’s 
going to program this thing?” 

Auberson gestured at the print- 
out, “It’s right there in that 
schematic you’re holding.” At 
least, I hope it is. Damn! / wish 
Harlie had explained this to me in 
more detail. 



D ORNE paged through the 
papers slowly, scanning each 
fold of the seemingly endless 



154 



GALAXY 




document. “You might be right 
about a computer’s being big 
enough to solve the world, Aubie, 
but I don’t see how.’’ He turned 
another page. “I’m sure the pro- 
graming will hang you up. One of 
the reasons current computers are 
limited to the size models they are 
is the law of diminishing returns. 
Above a certain size computer, 
programing reaches such com- 
plexity that it becomes a bigger 
problem than the problem itself.” 
“Keep looking,” said Auberson. 
“It’s there.” 

“Ah, here we are.” Dome laid 
the printout flat on his desk and 
began reading. A thoughtful frown 
creased his brow and he pursed his 
lips in concentration. “It looks like 
Harlie’s input units,” he said, then 
looked again. “No, it looks like 
Harlie is the input unit.” 

“That’s right.” 

“Oh?” said Dome. “Would you 
like to explain that?” 

How do I gel into these things? 
Auberson found himself wondering. 
I'm only supposed to be a psychol- 
ogist. Damn — I wish Handley were 
here. 

“I’ll try. Harlie will be linked up 
to the G.O.D. through a program- 
ing input translator. He’ll also be 
handling output the same way, 
translating it back into English 
for us. That translator is part of 
the self-programing unit.” 

“If we’re building a self- 
programing unit, what do we need 
Harlie for?” 



“Harlie is that self-program- 
ing unit. Remember, that’s the 
main reason he was built — to be 
a self-programing, problem-solving 
device.” 

“Wait a minute,” interrupted 
Dome. “Harlie is the result of our 
first JudgNaut Project. He was 
supposed to be a working unit. Are 
you telling me that he can handle 
the JudgNaut functions after all?” 

“No, he can’t. But he will be able 
to when this machine is built. The 
JudgNaut was this company’s first 
attempt at massive use of complex 
Judgment circuitry in a large-scale 
computer. It was meant to be a 
self-programing, problem-solving 
device — and we found it couldn’t 
be built because there was no way 
to make it flexible enough to 
consider all the aspects of every 
program it might be required to set 
up. So we built Harlie — but he is 
not the JudgNaut — and that's what 
all the confusion is about. Harlie is 
more flexible than our concept of 
the JudgNaut, but in making him 
more flexible we had to apply more 
circuitry to each function. In doing 
so we sacrificed a good portion of 
the range we had hoped the 
machine would cover. Harlie can 
write programs, yes — so can any 
human being — but not by the order 
of magnitude that the JudgNaut 
would have — had we been able to 
build it.” 

“And that’s one of my biggest 
gripes,” put in Dome. “That the 
JudgNaut Project was subverted 



TROUBLE WITH G.O.D. 



155 




into Harlie — which can’t show a 
profit.” 

“But he can — and will. For one 
thing, Harlie is genuinely creative. 
He knows that this company wants 
to market a large-scale program- 
writing computer. Harlie isn’t that 
computer — but he knows how to 
give himself that capability. And 
that’s what you want, isn’t it?” 

A UBERSON did not wait for 
L Dome’s grudging assent. He 
went right on: “Harlie isn’t just 
satisfied with meeting the specifi- 
cations of the original problem — he 
wants to surpass them. All you 
want is a device that can set up and 
solve models within a limited range. 
Harlie wants a device that can set 
up and solve any size model.” 
“And Harlie’s going to program 
this machine, right?” 

“Right.” 

“How? You just finished telling 
me he wasn’t all that much better 
than a human programer.” 

“In grasp, no — but in speed and 
thoroughness he can’t be matched. 
He has capabilities that a flesh-and- 
blood human doesn’t. For one 
thing, he’s faster. For another, he 
can write the program directly into 
the computer — and experience it as 
a part of himself as he writes it. He 
can’t make mistakes either. He’s 
limited to the size models that 
human programers can construct 
for much the same reasons they 
are. His brain functions aren’t big 
enough to handle more. Harlie’s 



ego functions supersede much of 
the circuitry that would have been 
used for forebrain functions in the 
JudgNaut. But in this respect, 
Harlie’s got an advantage over 
human programers — he can in- 
crease the size of his forebrain 
functions. Or he will be able to with 
the G.O.D. He’ll program it by 
making it a part of himself — by 
becoming one with it — and using 
its capabilities to handle its own 
programing. He’ll be monitoring 
and experiencing the program as 
he writes it directly into the G.O.D. 
As the model is manipulated, 
Harlie will be able to adapt the 
program to cover any situation 
possible. Their combined capa- 
bilities will be much more than 
the sum of their separate parts.” 

“So why not just build these 
functions into the G.O.D. in the 
first place?” 

“If we didn’t have Harlie we’d 
have to — but if we didn’t have 
Harlie we wouldn’t have the 
G.O.D. either. The G.O.D. is in- 
tended to be almost entirely fore- 
brain functions. We’ve already got 
the massive ego function that will 
control it. Why build a new one?” 

“Massive ego is right.” 

Auberson ignored the comment. 
“Basically this G.O.D. machine is 
the rest of Harlie’s brain. It has the 
thought centers that a conscious- 
ness such as Harlie’s should have 
access to. Take another look at 
those printouts. Did you see a thing 
call Programing Implementation?” 



156 



GALAXY 




“Yes, what about it?” 

“Well, that’s Harlie’s vanity 
again. He doesn’t want to call it 
what it really is, but it’s an addi- 
tional lobe for his brain. He’ll 
need a monitor unit to control each 
specific section of the G.O.D. 
Because the G.O.D. will have no 
practical limit — it can grow as big 
as we let it — Harlie’s grasp will 
have to be increased proportionally. 
That’s what that unit does. As each 
lobe of the G.O.D. is completed an 
equivalent monitoring lobe goes 
into Programing Implementation. 
Not only that, but because Harlie 
is an electronic entity his thoughts 
are already in computer language — 
it will be a maximum efficiency 
interface between himself and the 
G.O.D. He’ll need only to think 
of a program and it’ll be written 
into fact. It’s the most efficient 
function Harlie could have.” 

“I see,” said Dome. “And he 
planned it that way himself, right?” 
Auberson nodded, “But it’s a 
natural — look, a computer is very 
much like a mystic oracle. You not 
only have to know what questions 
to ask, but how to phrase them — 
and the answers are not always 
what you expect, or necessarily in 
terms you can understand. Who 
better to use as a translator than 
someone who’s half-oracle and 
half-human?” 

D ORNE was not paying atten- 
tion. Instead he mused aloud, 
continuing a previous train of 



thought, “A neat trick that, a neat 
trick. We tell him he’s got to come 
up with some way to be profitable 
and he tells us to build a new 
machine that only he can program. 
I have the feeling that he did it on 
purpose— that this may be the only 
context in which Harlie would be 
valuable. And once we establish 
Harlie’s worth to the project that 
leaves us with the question: is the 
total concept profitable? And that 
brings us back to where we started; 
Is Harlie profitable?” 

Auberson decided to ignore the 
last question. He said, “Harlie 
thinks the total concept is profit- 
able. It’s in the printouts.” 

“Ah, yes — but Harlie’s got a 
vested interest in the project.” 
“Why not?” said Auberson. “It’s 
his project. He’s the one who’s 
presenting it to the board for 
approval.” 

“And it’s sure to be voted down.” 
The chairman looked at the back of 
his hand. “I can’t see any way for 
this to be approved. I’m not even 
sure we should bring it up.” 

“It’s too late,” said Auberson. 
“You’re going to have to bring it 
up. And you’re going to have to 
give it a fair hearing. You told 
Harlie to come up with a way to be 
profitable. Now you’ve got to give 
him his chance to be heard.” 

“This is ridiculous. He’s only a 
machine.” 

“You want to go through that 
argument again?” asked Auberson. 
“No.” Dome shuddered. He 



TROUBLE WITH G.O.D. 



157 




still remembered the last time. “All 
right, I’ll have the board consider 
it, Aubie, but the whole situation is 
unreal — having a computer design 
another computer that will give it 
a job. You know what Elzer is 
going to say, don’t you? You’d just 
better be prepared for defeat, that’s 
all.” 

“Just give us the chance,” said 
Auberson. “We’ll take it from 
there.” 

Dome half nodded, half 
shrugged, “Better start preparing 
your arguments now — you’ve only 
got a couple weeks.” 

“Two and a half,” corrected 
Aubie, “and that’s more than 
enough time. We’ve got Harlie 
on our side.” He was already out 
of his chair. As he closed the door 
behind him. Dome was again 
paging through the printouts and 
shaking his head. 

Ill 

B ack in his own office Auber- 
son stared into his desk drawer, 
his hand hovering over a decision. 
At last he decided on the pills — he 
had sworn off the grass and he was 
going to stick to that. 

I should throw those High- 
masters away — they’re probably 
stale by now anyway. But no, pot 
doesn't get stale, does it? He kept 
promising himself that he would 
give the rest of the pack to Handley, 
but for some reason he kept for- 
getting. Probably because as long 



as they were in the drawer they 
were insurance. In case he changed 
his mind. 

He swallowed two of the pills 
without water, slid the drawer 
shut, then put his head in his hands 
and waited for the effect. He 
thought about going down to the 
cafeteria for lunch, but somehow 
didn’t quite feel like it. Abruptly 
he straightened and looked 
around. 

On one corner of his desk stood 
a console magtyper, an electronic 
input/output unit connected to the 
company’s master computer and 
data network — and all the outlets 
that entailed. It was a memo pipe- 
line, a mail processor, a filing 
system, a data storage and retrieval 
bank — it was a total information 
handling system. Anything typed 
into it could be printed out in any 
form the system was capable of — a 
memo, a letter, a file, a report. All 
information was instantly retriev- 
able — or retrievable only to those 
who had access to it through knowl- 
edge of the proper code keys. One 
key was necessary for retrieval, 
another was needed for revising the 
material. 

Any information held in “work- 
ing” or temporary storage could be 
instantly updated, annotated, 
erased or rewritten. All data was 
held in temporary storage for 
ninety days, at the end of which 
time it was either passed into per- 
manent storage or erased, depend- 
ing on its original coding. Working 



158 



GALAXY 




data was maintained indefinitely 
in “temporary” storage to allow 
instant updating. 

Invoices, orders, manufacturing 
schedules, billing and payrolls, 
too— all were handled through the 
system. The network handled all 
corporate paperwork functions. 
The entire company was tapped 
into it. An executive could perform 
his job wherever he had access to a 
computer terminal — and with a 
portable terminal he could perform 
his job wherever he had access to a 
telephone. Indeed, many of the 
company’s officers had acquired 
portable units for just that purpose. 

Most of the terminals were CRT 
units — cathode ray tubes and key- 
boards — although a few, like 
Auberson’s, were electric type- 
writers with magnetic tape storage 
of characters — called magtypers 
for short. It was a familiar unit, 
manufactured by IBM and used 
throughout the industry — it was 
cheaper than designing and 
building one’s own. 

Curious about something, Auber- 
son switched it on and typed, 
HARLIE? 

YES, BOSS, replied the machine. 
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? 

Auberson jumped as if stung, so 
YOU REALLY ARE WIRED INTO THE 
SYSTEM. 

I TOLD YOU I WAS, replied Harlie. 
Somehow on this machine he 
seemed like a disembodied voice. 
He was obviously here — yet, aside 
from the words on the paper, the 



room held no visible sign of his 
presence. 

It has to be a psychological 
phenomenon, thought Auberson. 
I’m too used to seeing all that 
machinery — I associate it with him. 
He typed, yes, but i didn’t 

QUITE BELIEVE THAT YOU HAD 
TAPPED INTO MY OFFICE, TOO. 

WHY NOT? it’s part OF THE 
SYSTE.M. 

I ASSUME you’re INTO EVERY 
OTHER MAGTYPER AS WELL. 

OF COURSE. AND THE CRT UNITS. 
EVERY OUTLET OF THE MASTER 
BEAST. 

T he master beast — that was the 
company nickname for the 
network. It was used by office boy 
and executive alike. Auberson 
wondered what they would call it 
if they knew it had been taken over 
by a conscious and highly intel- 
ligent entity, i wouldn’t tell 
ANYONE ELSE ABOUT THIS, HARLIE, 
he typed, it wouldn’t be a very 
GOOD IDEA. 

WHATEVER YOU SAY, BOSS. IT’LL 
BE OUR LITTLE SECRET. 

FINE. 

Auberson had started to switch 
off when his eye caught a flash of 
color. Bright orange, it was the 
card from Stel in his wastebasket. 
HARLIE, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO 
DO ME A FAVOR? 

what’s the FAVOR? 

I GOT A FRIENDSHIP CARD FROM 
STEL THIS MORNING. I’D LIKE TO 
SEND ONE BACK TO HER. NO, NOT A 



TROUBLE WITH G.O.D. 



159 




CARD. A POEM. I WANT TO SEND 
HER A POEM. CAN YOU WRITE ME 
ONE? 

YES, I CAN. I WILL SEND IT TO 
HER, TOO. 

no! rapped Auberson. i’ll send 

IT TO HER. YOU LET ME SEE IT 
FIRST, YOU UNDERSTAND? 

YES, SIR. 

The phone rang then and Auber- 
son forgot for the moment about 
Harlie. It was Hooker, the Plant 
Security Chief. “Mr. Auberson?” 
he asked. “You know a guy named 
Krofft?” 

“Krofft?” Abruptly he remem- 
bered. “Yes, I know him — why?” 
“We caught him walking out 
with a foot-high stack of printouts. 
He says it’s okay — that they’re 
his — but we thought we’d better 
check with you first.” 

“Yes, it’s okay. Is he there now?” 
“Yeah.” 

“Put him on, will you please?” 
There was a sound of muffled 
voices. Auberson waited. He was 
dimly aware that his magtyper was 
clattering out something, but he 
flipped the silence hood over it and 
leaned back in his chair again. 
“Mr. Auberson?” 

“Yes— Dr. Krofft?” 

“Yes. I meant to thank you for 
allowing me so much time with 
Harlie this morning. It was a very 
productive session.” 

“Good. Then you will be building 
a new gravity wave detector, won’t 
you?” 

“Well, first I have to publish the 



theory behind it, but — how did you 
know about it?” 

“I told you this morning. Harlie 
doesn’t keep any secrets from me. 
1 assume that’s what your stack of 
printouts is about, right?” 

“Uh — yes.” Krofft sounded a 
little taken aback. “It’s the com- 
pleted math on the theory and a 
rough schematic of the device. 
Harlie handled it like it was 
nothing. He was even able to sug- 
gest some short cuts for building 
the thing.” 

“Good,” said Auberson. “I’m 
glad we could help. If you need to 
talk to him again come through me. 
Otherwise you’re likely to experi- 
ence all kinds of corporate hassles. 
I’ll see that you get as much time 
with him as you need.” 

“That’s very good of you.” 
“Thanks, but I’m doing it for 
Harlie as much as for you.” 

“Still, if there’s anything I 
can — ” 

“Well, now that you mention it — 
there is something. If anything 
important should come of this 
gravity thing — if it can be called 
that — I’d like Harlie to get some 
credit for it.” 

“Why, Dr. Auberson, that was 
my intention all along. Are you 
implying that — ” 

“Oh, no, no. You misunderstand. 
I don’t care about public credit and 
I don’t think Harlie does either. 
No, what 1 want is credit with the 
company. Right now I’m a little 
bit involved in trying to prove that 



160

Harlie is worth the cost of main- 
taining him. Anything I can use to 
support this fight, I want.” 

“Oh, I understand.” Krofft was 
instantly solicitous. “Yes, I’ll be 
glad to help in that. Why, Harlie’s 
been of inestimable help in my 
research. To be able to sit and talk 
with a computer as if he were 
another research scientist— why, 
it’s like talking to God.” 

“I know the feeling,” Auberson 
said slowly. 

Krofft failed to catch his 
meaning. He said, “Well, I’ll be 
glad to do anything I can to help. 
A letter, a phone call, if you want 
me to speak to somebody— just 
name it.” 

“Fine. That’s all 1 want. I’ll have 
to check back with you later on 
this.” 

“Oh, very good. Then I’ll be 
talking to you.” 

“Fine. Is Hooker still there?” 

“Uh, yes.” 

“Ask him if he wants to talk to 
me again.” 

A pause, muffled voices. “No, 
no he doesn’t.” 

“Okay, fine. Dr. Krofft. I’ll be 
seeing you.” 

AUBERSON replaced the phone 
in the cradle and leaned back 
in his chair. He did not expect 
much help from the little man. 

His back hurt and he stretched 
his arms out over his head, trying 
to ease the pain. He was having 
backaches more and more these 



days. I must be getting old, he 
thought, smiling grimly — and then 
it hit him. In two years. I will be 
old. Forty is when “old" starts. 
The sensation was a cold one. He 
pulled down his arms quickly. 

He thought about Harlie again, 
wondered exactly what conclusions 
he and Krofft had come to. No 
matter. Even if Harlie could ex- 
plain them he, Auberson, — with 
only a psychologist’s training— 
probably wouldn’t be able to 
understand. Often he found himself 
wondering just how he had ended 
up in charge of the Harlie project 
anyway. 

Ah, well — the boss didn’t have to 
know how to run the business. He 
only needed to know how to run the 
people who knew. 

He leaned forward and flipped 
back the silence hood of his typer, 
curious to see what Harlie had 
written. A loose loop of paper 
sprawled out. Typed on it was: 

SPEAK TO ME IN MANY WAYS 

IN MANY TIMES 

IN MANY DAYS, 

IN MANY WORDS 

AND MANY TONGUES, 

THAT WE MAY TOUCH WHILE WE 
ARE YOUNG. 

THERE ARE NO WORDS THAT EARS 
CAN HEAR, 

NO WORDS CAN EVER SAY IT 
CLEAR, 

THE WORDS OF LOVE ARE WORDS, 
MY DEAR, 



TROUBLE WITH G.O.D. 



161 




BUT WORDS THAT ONLY LOVERS 
HEAR. 

A GENTLE TOUCH, 

A LOOK, 

A GLANCE, 

THAT HAUNTING TUNE, 

THAT LONELY DANCE. 

SPEAK TO ME WITH WORDS OF 
LOVE, 

AND IN THE WAYS I’M FONDEST 
OF, 

THE WORDS OF LOVE. 

THE WORDS THAT ISSUE FROM NO 
THROAT, ■ 

THE WORDS THAT MAKE THE 
BRIGHTNESS FLOAT, 

THE KISS, 

THE TOUCH, 

THE GENTLE NOTE, 

THE WORDS THAT NO PEN EVER 
WROTE. 

I LOVE THE WORDS YOU SPEAK 
TO ME, 

THAT SECRET SILENT LITURGY, 
BUT WORDS ARE WORDS 
AND MIGHT BE WRONG— 
WITHOUT MUSIC, IT IS NOT SONG. 

SO THOUGH I ASK THE WORDS 
OF LOVE, 

THE ASKER IS NOT BLINDED, 

A WORD IS JUST A HOLLOW 
SOUND 

WITHOUT A THOUGHT BEHIND IT. 
YOUR WORDS, MY LOVE, ARE 
ONLY WAYS 

TO SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS, 



TO SHARE YOUR DAYS. 

YOUR LOVE, MY LOVE, 

IS THE WAY YOU SAY 
you’ll speak to me in special 
WAYS. 



Auberson read it through, 
frowning slightly. Then he read it 
again. It was — nice. Very nice. 
But he wasn’t sure whether he liked 
it or not. He rolled it out of the 
machine, carefully tore it off and 
folded it into his pocket. He would 
have to think about this before he 
sent it. It almost said too much. 

He thumbed the typer to life. He 
hesitated while he rephrased the 
thought in his mind, then slowly 
pecked out: harlie, do you 

REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID YOUR 
PURPOSE WAS? 

I SAID THAT MY PURPOSE IS TO 
HELP MEN FIND THEIRS. MY PUR- 
POSE IS TO FIND GOD. 

ARE YOU ACCOMPLISHING THAT? 

THE G.O.D. WILL ACCOMPLISH 
THE TASK. IT WILL BE GOD. IT WILL 
EXPLAIN DEATH. IT WILL IDENTIFY 
LOVE. 

Auberson typed carefully, there 
WILL BE MEN WHO WILL NOT LIKE 
YOUR ANSWERS, HARLIE. YOU WILL 
BE ATTACKED. ARE YOU SURE 

that’s what you want? 

Harlie threw it back at him. 
THEY WILL NOT BE MY ANSWERS, 
AUBERSON — THEY WILL BE YOURS. 
AND THEY WILL BE IRREFUTABLE. 
ARE YOU SURE THAT’S WHAT YOU 
WANT? ★

... On who first correctly theorized the nature of the Milky IVay? 

Credit for the discovery that the Milky Way is composed of my- 
riads of stars at such great distances as to be individually indistin- 
guishable is universally accorded Galileo, who first examined this 
luminous band with a telescope in 1610. Credit for the theory that 
such was the composition of the Milky Way must go to Democritus, 
c. 460-360 B.C., a Greek philosopher in Thrace, surnamed the 
“Laughing Philosopher,” who, two thousand years ahead of his 
time, had no way of demonstrating his hypothesis. 

.. .On how long men believed Earth to be Center of the Universe? 

The theory that the moon, sun, planets and stars revolve around 
the Earth as the center, with assistance from epicycles, deferents 
etc., was detailed by Claudius Ptolemy c. 140 a.d., of Alexandria — 
who probably got most of his ideas from Hipparchus, c. 130 B.c. 
Ptolemy’s explanation of the planetary motions was one of the most 
successful and long-lived scientific theories ever advanced — it was 
still being taught, along with the Copernican theory, at Yale and 
Harvard as late as 1650. (I have this straight from a professor of 
astronomy at Princeton.) 

.. .On who first discovered the law of conservation of energy? 

Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand Von Helmholtz (1821-1894) was the 
first to announce the theory of the maintenance of the sun’s heat by 
gravitational attraction — he did so in a series of popular lectures — 
and is generally credited with the discovery. But he seems to have 
been preceded in promulgating his principle by a lesser known man, 
Julius Robert Von Mayer (1814-1878), a German physician and 
physicist. Mayer suffered acutely from domestic grief and lack of 
scientific recognition. He once attempted suicide and in 1851 
entered a mental hospital. He was later released and made a member 
of the nobility in 1867.

GALAXY 





I T WAS an insect. It couldn’t 
possibly be a ship. But I knew 
that the twelve jointed appendages 
and what appeared to be a neat 
division into bead, thorax and 
abdomen were no trick of viewing 
angle — I had been clear around it 
and it was real. The appearance of 
the thing imparted to the clicking 
I had picked up on the communica- 
tions band a crawling, chitinous 
connotation. I was glad 1 had my 
mind on death and destruction — it 
made a good counterpoise to the 
gray wash of uneasiness the thing 
gave me. 

The uneasiness brought me up 
short and I thought for the 
millionth time about my unique 
problem: objective or subjective? 
I thumbed the red button — not the 
recessed missile release next to it, 
but the one that broke the circuit 
to Langley Station — and the un- 
easiness remained. So, I thought, 
objective. A true uneasiness, not an 
emotion picked up from whoever 
lived in the other ship. An honest- 
to-God product of my imagina- 
tion’s toying with what it saw 
as crawly stuff. Arachnoid — ergo, 
threatening. 

I shook my head in annoyance, 
released the button and got the 
background “noise” again, like 
opening a window to the sound of 
wind in the trees. Vague impress- 
ions chased themselves around the 
edges of my consciousness. Were 
they from the ship? If so, whatever 
lived there was either asleep or 



inactive. Or it might be the noise 
of the pickups themselves trans- 
lating into emotions. The noise 
could do that. I didn’t “hear” any- 
thing, of course — the limitations 
imposed on Langley Station’s 
sophisticated equipment by the 
laws of thermal motion and 
statistical probability manifested 
themselves as vague emotions. The 
phenomenon was what you would 
expect from an emotion detector. 
Unfortunately nobody until now 
had known it was an emotion 
detector. The classified pickup head 
in my cramped little shuttle vehicle 
was supposed to amplify what I had 
been laughingly told were thoughts. 
Nobody knew whether it would 
work on an extraterrestrial life 
form, of course, because nobody 
had ever met one — it was simply 
one of an armamentarium of 
devices Defense had stockpiled 
against what it saw as an “eventu- 
ality.” Nobody really believed it 
would ever be used, any more than 
anybody really expected the global 
defense systems to be used in the 
days when political entities fought 
with one another. That they had 
been used was unfortunate — and 
so was this. And when we actually 
turned the thing on our first honest, 
genuine ET, we found we didn’t 
have a thought detector at all, but 
an emotion detector. 

You can’t record emotions and 
play them back, not yet, anyway. 
And you can’t send them down a 
wire or over a tightbeam. In fact, 



THE LANGLEY CIRCUIT 



165 




whatever the pickup head radiated 
after amplifying it was good only 
for a radius of several hundred feet. 
The huge apparatus on Langley 
Station was necessary to run the 
thing, but for readout we still 
needed a biological sensor — me. 
Hence J. J. Mansard (for Jorge 
Jeremy — my old man had a wry 
touch to his insanity), Captain, 
Space Division, Air Force, 
formerly attached to New York 
Orbiting Synchronous Observa- 
tion, got himself suddenly booted 
upstairs to Langley Experimental 
Satellite and thence, you should 
pardon the expression, to the stars. 

Well, not quite to the stars. The 
ET was detected as an unusual 
companion to a chunk of rock not 
quite big enough to be called an 
asteroid, with an orbit not quite 
small enough to refer to it as part 
of our solar system, even if our sun 
did occupy one focus of its path. 
It was at the very limits of observa- 
tion, heading in. One of our deep 
research probes had picked it up 
and sent its coordinates back with 
the usual particle density informa- 
tion and so forth. Research queried 
for visuals, which had to come by 
slowscan. By the time they were in 
the job had already been bumped to 
Langley and the vast, seldom- 
used machinery of Evaluation of 
Possible Extraterrestrial Hostility 
was turning over. And they had 
their volunteer biological sensor 
and possible ambassador. 

I had become it because I had the 



one quality that makes me a jaw- 
grinding impossibility to have 
around in training — 1 was emotion- 
less. Nothing got to me. You could 
call it iron control or you could call 
it being dead inside — it didn’t 
matter much. Psych knew why, but 
they kept discreetly quiet and so 
did I. We both knew that though I 
might be a shade uncomfortable at 
times, I was sitting on a priceless 
asset that might get me a com- 
mandership at any critical moment. 
I even knew pretty much when 1 
had been shot down so hard that 
something in me had decided to 
stop feeling, but 1 was in the posi- 
tion of the one-armed pirate who 
learns to use a hook — I was in a 
place and at a point in time where 
and when my handicap was an 
asset. And that was what counted 
when they handed out stripes. 1 
even had had to step on a few 
people on the way here — nobody 
seemed to mind very much. The 
brass conveniently looked the other 
way. They were protecting an 
asset. 

So J. J. Mansard, the Cold Fish 
of Boulder Academy, makes his 
big break for fame and fortune in 
the service of his country. And 
winds up on the receiving end 
of — of all things — an emotion 
transmitter. 

Imagine that. 



T he brass had kind of con- 
sidered that possibility, too. 



166 



GALAXY 




and decided that if it did happen 
that emotions came through along 
with the thoughts 1 would be pro- 
tected by my own carapace, easily 
able to differentiate between the 
ET’s emotional responses and my 
own, since I didn’t have any. On 
the conscious level, anyhow. 
Perfect. 

We had not counted, of course, 
on nothing making it through save 
emotions, but I could still restore 
my objectivity by hitting the 
button. It broke the Langley circuit 
and stopped the transmission. 
Whereupon the thoughts that 
remained could only be mine. And 
back at the other end of Sol’s 
gravity, where Langley’s ten-mile 
webwork dish held me at the focus 
like a bug on a pin, an evaluation 
crew whose size would scare you 
analyzed temperature, absorption, 
mass and suchlike data automati- 
cally — everything except what we 
expected to be extraterrestrial 
thought patterns, which I sent back 
verbally after interpreting them for 
myself. 

For an instant I glanced through 
the port, beyond the FT ship’s 
jointed immensity toward Sol, 
unthinkably tiny at this distance. 
After a minute I picked it out or 
thought I did. Actually, after Sol 
had shrunk to a barely perceptible 
disk, I had attached myself to a 
large, bright, ruddy star that 
happened to be conveniently in the 
viewfield. When 1 stopped to think 
about it I felt that I was satisfying 



an unconscious desire for a G3. The 
thought of its orange warmth 
pleased me. 

While 1 was thinking about that 
1 got another wash of vaguely 
identifiable emotion. I jabbed the 
button a few times to give me an 
objective reference, then read off 
my impressions into the recorder. 
1 reflected that today’s report was 
going to look just like yesterday’s, 
except that the exact quality of the 
slowly increasing emotions was 
different, as it had been a few hours 
earlier— and a few hours before 
that. 1 didn’t know what Langley 
was getting out of this and 1 didn’t 
know if Langley knew, but it 
seemed to me that the Langley 
circuit was somewhat less than the 
screaming success we had expected. 
1 hoped that they were getting 
enough out of the hard data from 
the regular receptors. 

Things have a way of being 
naturally hilarious. I had just 
decided that Langley should cer- 
tainly be able to evaluate the intent 
of the FTs from the data already in, 
when I got clobbered — and the 
whole picture changed. 

During all this time the FT ship 
and I had orbited each other sev- 
eral miles apart, neither giving any 
sign that it recognized the other as 
anything more than another lump 
of rock. No sign of motion beyond 
the normal perturbations of orbit, 
no visible radiation save thermals 
and my tightbeam, which was very 
well shielded, and the chitinous 



THE LANGLEY CIRCUIT 



167 




clicks at 21 MHz from my friend 
over there. 

Then, without warning, 1 found 
myself holding on to the comm 
bulkhead, knuckles white with ef- 
fort, eyes squeezed nearly shut 
against the tears that welled up un- 
controllably. 1 was shaking with a 
bottomless and sourceless grief 
that was beyond solace. 

Instinctively I went for the but- 
ton, which may have saved me from 
cracking right there. The emotion 
was instantly gone, but its physical 
effects remained — the pain, the 
tears, the shaking — to remind me 
that it had been there. 

I looked around, trembling with 
reaction and a little scared. There 
was a hint that this mission was not 
the piece of cake I had come to 
believe it was. There was a discon- 
nect key for the Langley circuit in 
thexomm rack across the room — 
and to reach it I would have to let 
go of the button. 

I wasn’t supposed to use the dis- 
connect key except in emergency. 
Was I scared? You bet I was. 
Scared enough to turn the thing 
off until I had time to think. Not 
scared of what the ET might be 
doing or of what it had felt in order 
to project that awful sensation of 
everything’s-over — simply scared 
of feeling. Period. As my immi- 
grant great-great-grandfather had 
said; nobody had told him about 
this on the boat. 

So I gritted my teeth, braced my- 
self for a dash across the compart- 



ment and got off the button. And 
was rewarded by background noise. 
It was such an anticlimax that I 
doubled up halfway to the discon- 
nect key and nearly kissed my head 
on the panel. 

I got hold of a grab handle and 
floated, eyeing the key. 

Well, I thought, here's where it 
gets interesting. What happened 
once is bound to repeat — let’s not 
live in fear of it, shall we? 

N evertheless i stayed 

within a quick jump of the 
button for a good twenty minutes 
before I began to relax. And, in 
fact, nothing did happen for several 
hours. When it did it was a whole 
new surprise. 

Because it was laughter. The pro- 
jection of an event so funny as to be 
absolutely side-splitting. I roared, 
held my chest, fell over myself 
gasping for air — finally hit the 
button for a breather. When I could 
inhale and exhale fairly normally I 
let up again and — surprise — got 
another dose of the same. It lasted 
for about fifteen more seconds, 
then faded out, leaving me chuck- 
ling at the impassive face of the 
chrono as if we shared some hilari- 
ous secret. 

Well, I reflected, that one wasn’t 
so bad. Whatever lived in the ET 
ship, besides feeling terribly woeful, 
also seemed to have quite a sense of 
humor. That wasn’t so hard to take. 
I got out the mike and read that 
into the recorder, then took a deep 



168 



GALAXY 




breath. Apparently whatever was 
going to happen was going to pro- 
vide some variety. 

It did. The next bout was with 
anger. It came very fast, lasted only 
a few seconds and left me shaking, 
furious, a hard metallic taste in my 
mouth and adrenalin copiously 
flooding my veins. I bit my lip, 
sat myself in the comm chair and 
worked it off by clenching and un- 
clenching my fists. 

When I could think normally 
again it occurred to me that 1 might 
be overreacting in natural reaction 
to my usual control. Put that in the 
notes. Actually doubted it. What- 
ever was happening in the ET ship 
was really taking me over the ropes. 

Some other things began to come 
over. 1 was able after a while to 
identify a particular characteristic 
that all of the emotions 1 was re- 
ceiving seemed to share. It was a 
texture, like the timbre of a voice. 
I developed the distinct impres- 
sion that those emotions undoubt- 
edly came from a single entity 
within the ship, rather than from 
several minds. The thought, then: 
Quite possibly this is also a scout, 
a probe like ours — it could be 
manned by a single person. After 
that I began to search for a pattern 
in the emotions, some common 
thread that would tie them together 
into a personality. 

I didn’t find one at first, but I 
did realize something else — slowly 
and over a period of time I was 
changing. I was developing a sensi- 



tivity. It didn’t matter what the 
emotions were that I was receiving 
— the fact of their existence for me 
was making me more aware of 
them and more aware of what the 
emotions of the people at the other 
end of my comm lifeline might be. 

Not good. It was destroying my 
objectivity. 

I debated shutting the Langley 
circuit down for a few hours a day 
to give me time to rest up, but the 
mission wouldn’t allow it and I 
knew it. That meant that I had to 
be continually on my guard, ready 
to separate objective from subjec- 
tive experience, to identify as alien 
the flux of strange emotions I now 
dimly identified as female pouring 
into me through the probe. Don’t 
ask me why I sensed them as fe- 
male. I just did. 

But 1 knew that we didn’t have 
long to go on this evaluation mis- 
sion. I could take it without much 
strain, I thought — without losing 
too much of the implacable cool 
for which I’d been selected. When 
the Langley people completed their 
evaluation I would either go 
straight home or follow one of the 
possible alternate plans — one of 
which, thank their military hearts, 
involved six nuclear torpedoes 
snuggled in the forward compart- 
ment. 

I had a sudden qualm about that 
— I hadn’t expected to be in emo- 
tional rapport with a possible en- 
emy. Where is that famous cold- 
bloodedness, Mansard? I decided 



THE LANGLEY CIRCUIT 



169 




to work up a set of nastiness exer- 
cises — for protection, understand? 
Back to death and destruction. 

AS THE days crawled by I found 
-tA. personalization treeping in. 
Whether I wanted to or not I began 
to speculate on whether the thing 
in the ship really had a gender of 
any sort, and what kind it might 
be. Emotions are not a valid guide, 
but I thought it almost certainly 
had to have a sex — survival of the 
average species demanded that — 
and the odds were in favor of an ad- 
vanced race’s being bisexual. Any- 
way I found myself thinking of my 
unknown friend as “she.” Every rule 
was against a personal involvement, 
but nobody had ever found himself 
in emotional relationship with a 
theoretical ET before. “Other peo- 
ple” were what you met, what 
you dealt with in syntaxes or 
mathematical constructions which 
had as their referents things and re- 
lationships and which carried 
emotions like supercargo — some- 
thing easily forgotten about. If I 
punched the button all communica- 
tion ceased. Ergo, the button stayed 
up and what happened was exactly 
the reverse of the way Man was 
meant to think — emotions pounded 
in, translating themselves — some- 
times — into things and relation- 
ships. I took as a working premise 
that the situation possessed some- 
thing I wryly dubbed iconoemotive 
symmetry, hoping it would take its 
place along with the other sub- 



atomic symmetries — I assumed 
that, if it were possible to go from 
words to emotions, then I could 
damn well go from emotions to 
words and make it at least as auto- 
matic as the other way around. Cer- 
tain of the processes wouldn’t re- 
verse, of course. I would have to 
feel the emotion or process it — that 
was a good null-emotional word — 
translate it into speech, then block 
and purge the emotion that gave 
rise to the words. Preserving objec- 
tivity. 

1 gave it a good try. Picture meet- 
ing a friend in the morning. You 
exchange the usual phatic greeting. 
Then you inquire after his health in 
the ritual way and he says, “Got a 
headache today.” You tut-tut and 
go on. “Hello” is phatic, “Got a 
headache” is not — but in the con- 
text of casual conversation the 
whole exchange is emotionally 
empty. He doesn’t expect you to 
fall over his headache and you cer- 
tainly don’t intend to — in fact, the 
only reason he mentioned it was 
that it was the first thing on his 
mind and he didn’t bother to hide it. 

Now suppose that when you met 
this guy, instead of saying anything 
you were immediately clobbered 
with the pain of his headache. Sup- 
pose further that, because he knew 
damn well you didn’t care two 
chits about his head, he had given 
you the barest sketch of the pain he 
was feeling. Suddenly it’s your 
pain. What do you do? Does it 
make sharing an experience any 



170 



GALAXY 




easier? Any fuller? Or c^o you sim- 
ply learn to block it the way you 
learn to block it when it is merely 
suggested by words? 

You don’t learn to block it. Not 
in a period of days, not this cow- 
poke. I was being overwhelmed, 
drowned in somebody else’s emo- 
tions, and I knew it. Within two 
days it was like having two people 
living in my body, one whom I 
knew and one who was completely 
unpredictable in mood. 

A good way to go crazy. 

But the moods got to be predic- 
table. 

Don’t ask me how it happened, 
I don’t know. All I know is that at 
some point in the next few days 1 
began to anticipate what the next 
round of emotions would be. With- 
out my fully realizing it, experienc- 
ing them was ceasing to be a strain. 
They were just there, like my own. 
It might have been a protective 
device my brain had mustered to 
meet the occasion, giving me. the il- 
lusion of control — which is what 
anticipation is — or it might actually 
have been some sort of deductive 
process I had developed. But it 
worked — I stayed sane. 

And found that it worked in di- 
rections I didn’t expect and prob- 
ably don’t want. From the bare 
exchanges with Langley, which 
were the same clipped conversa- 
tions they had always been, I began 
to get unmistakable emotional 
overtones, clear and sharp. It was 



unfortunate that the first ones I 
got told me that they were worried 
that 1 was going insane. The mes- 
sage was not in what they said, but 
in what they didn’t say — the con- 
versational net, like poetry, sud- 
denly existed not for its strings and 
knots but for its holes. The silence 
surrounding the pronunciation of 
the word OM. It was impossible for 
them to hide anything from me. 

Anything. 

T his was very embarrassing. 

It might have made me a su- 
perb psychotherapist, but it was 
rapidly turning me into a rotten sol- 
dier. A soldier is — must be — an 
arm of his command, a reflex ma- 
chine, a mobile, thinking weapon. 
But not a feeling one. If bayonets 
had feelings they’d be people. 

I decided to cover up what they 
were looking for-— and discovered 1 
didn’t know how. I couldn’t re- 
member the precise way I had re- 
ported before. The gist of it, yes, 
but the exact syntax — that was 
what I needed. Not remembering 
threw me into a panic, but then I 
got an idea. On the pretext of 
checking the accuracy of some of 
my earlier transmissions I got them 
to play back to me three days’ 
worth of reports in my own voice. I 
got all of it on the recorder, then 
spent a whole day studying it. At 
the end of that time I could deliver 
an eyewitness account of the de- 
struction of the solar system and all 



THE LANGLEY CIRCUIT

of the works of man with all the 
emotional involvement of a turnip. 

They outsmarted me. By this 
time they were interested enough in 
what was happening to me to be do- 
ing a little analysis of their own 
and their syntax analyzers duly re- 
ported that I had inexplicably un- 
dergone a sudden regression to the 
speech patterns I had used at the 
start of the mission. 

H’m. 

It did not take long for them to 
figure out what 1 had done. So it 
was stalemate. 

But I could still do something 
other than analyze voiceprints — I 
could anticipate. And I anticipated 
that they would resolve what was 
rapidly becoming a very dangerous 
situation by ordering me to attack. 
They could order me to return, of 
course,' but I could refuse and then 
the whole dirty thing would be out 
on the washline. I was sure that 
they believed they had about a 
fifty-nine percent probability that 1 
could still carry out a successful 
attack on the ET ship and my soul- 
mate inside if I were sufficiently 
motivated — and they were right. I 
was also aware that if I didn’t, it 
was certain that they had little sur- 
prises built into the ship that would 
assure my not being any aid or 
comfort to the enemy. Like remote- 
operated destruct systems. It was 
only reasonable, I suddenly real- 
ized, that they have them. I was 
sure they had them. And, after one 
or two more exchanges with 



Langley over nothing in particular, 
I knew they had them. 

It was only a matter of the 
briefest time before they decided 
to do it — no more, maybe, then it 
took to get the joint chiefs together 
for an emergency session. Then I’d 
get the word to arm those deadly 
nuclear needles and send them 
boring in. I couldn’t refuse without 
killing myself — and I still wanted 
very much to be alive. Self-preser- 
vation still won out over brother- 
hood. Just barely. 

So I got myself a little sledge out 
of equipment stores, undogged the 
access hatch, floated down the little 
tube, undogged the weapons hatch 
and floated into the little tubular 
room where the nuclear torpedoes 
lived. Or rather, slept — by this time 
even the ship was beginning to feel 
sentient to me. Can a machine have 
emotions? Don’t ask me now, but 
try again in a few days. I was 
aware, at times dimly and at times 
acutely, that a fully sentient uni- 
verse would mean the end of hu- 
manity as we knew it, because you 
can’t manipulate a living thing and 
intelligence, as we understood it, 
impressed itself upon the universe 
by manipulating it. Picture build- 
ing a road if all the rocks you had 
to bulldoze out of the way were 
alive and conscious. And you’d 
need a relocation and reparation 
committee to wind your watch. 

So I got out my sledge and 
braced myself against the opposite 
wall of the tube and looked for ac- 



172 



GALAXY 




cess covers. And looked. 

Somebody back there had been 
just a little bit smarter than I’d fig- 
ured on. I found no access covers, 
no exposed machinery of any kind. 
No delicate launching or aiming 
gear. I didn’t have the faintest idea 
how the weapons aimed — maybe 
magnetically right through the 
casing, maybe with a transmitter/ 
receiver combination built into the 
missile cradle. But whatever it was, 
it was designed to be me-proof. 

That was a dead loss. I went for- 
ward through the tube and stowed 
the sledge. I toyed with the idea of 
smashing the radio, but that sort of 
giveaway would be just what they 
needed to turn me into a nice rosy 
ball of radioactivity. 

I got to the port and looked out. 
The orbit was stabilized so that that 
port always looked toward Alice’s 
ship. By now I was calling “her” 
Alice automatically, after the mili- 
tary designation for the mission, 
Alis-2 — besides, if she had any 
friends aboard, I had been unable 
to pick them up. 

Maybe she was alone, too, an ad- 
vance scout trying to assess alien 
motives, just as I was. Suppose she 
even had the ET equivalent of 
our mindscanner-that-didn’t-work? 
How the hell could I tell, without 
directly violating orders? Couldn’t. 

Then again, what sort of esthetic 
did a race develop that made them 
comfortable in a ship that looked so 
insectlike? What was the function 
of those leglike tubes? If they were 



duplicate living quarters leading off 
the main cabin the ship had twelve 
occupants, not one. Or maybe it 
had been commandeered, to be 
occupied by one person for this mis- 
sion alone. 

1 thought about what Alice might 
be doing now — filling out her 
equivalent of mission status re- 
ports, maybe telepath ically for all I 
knew? Filing them with her base 
somewhere, talking about that 
weird globular ship that looked so 
much like a melon? What kind of 
goofy creature could be comfort- 
able in one of those? 

Then I thought about the missile 
button. 

1 went to the comm desk, which 
was large enough to sit at, and got 
a sucktube of water. In a few short 
hours, barring unforseen accidents, 
the comm would buzz and Langley 
would give me the word to blow 
Alice and her ship to hell. Mercur- 
ial Alice, soft Alice, whose emo- 
tions — which I stole — had been 
keeping me alive for this long and 
absolutely empty trip. My body, 
Alice’s emotions — together we 

made a person. She might be physi- 
cally strange to me — maybe furry, 
maybe have too many arms — ^^but 
the inside of her head was as fami- 
liar to me as mine — and more 
wonderful for its suppleness, its 
brilliance. I could destroy it. Bring 
her back with me and take her off 
the ship and then destroy it. Bring 
her back with me and convince 
Langley it was okay. Find a way to 



THE LANGLEY CIRCUIT

work something out, hard as it 
might be — their authorities, our 
authorities. We were so close to- 
gether, her feelings had to be the 
same as mine — physical differences 
were no real barrier, we could 
straighten everything out if we 
wanted to. 



I HIT the comm desk with my 
fist, drifting away with the re- 
action. I had to do it! The stars 
shone in through the pitch black- 
ness of the port, each one a gem, 
each a tiny hard light on the tarred 
sky, each its own unique self as I 
had learned to see them through 
Alice’s eyes; each with its own emo- 
tional thrill, its own stark beauty. 
To lose that beauty forever by los- 
ing her — the one through whom 
1 had come to see it — I couldn’t do 
that, not with all other considera- 
tions aside. 

In the utter strangeness of the 
situation, cut off from all other life 
but the two of us, I had begun to 
feel for the woman in the ET ship 
something akin to love. 

Yes, damn it. 

Impossible maybe on Earth, on 
any planet with trees and water and 
something approaching a normal 
environment, but out here we two 
were our world. Her ship and mine 
— the gross, insectlike hulk and the 
tiny sphere, caught together in 
emptiness, far from a home that 
neither of us knew very well, lost in 
silences and nights and great un- 



touchable tapestries — were an en- 
tire sentient universe incarnate. 1 
had been miraculously reborn 
through her, had come to know that 
things possessed a quality of real- 
ness and unique beauty — each thing 
to itself— and from her, through 
the improbable electronic umbilical 
of the Langley circuit, 1 had learned 
slowly and painfully not only to 
know these things, but to praise 
them. 

I thought back over cadet days, 
remembered the honor commission 
I had almost won — until the com- 
mandant vetoed it. Then there was 
the Vega assignment, first berth on 
an interstellar exploration, that I’d 
lost to some captain’s son at the last 
minute. 

And now this — some fool slob 
at Langley was about to snatch 
something so far beyond those early 
dreams that the world shuddered. 

Not this time. Too much at stake. 

Frantically I looked around the 
cabin. There had to be something, 
some object, some tool that I could 
use to disable the torpedoes. Some- 
thing 1 could think of to stop them 
from issuing the order, some story 
to delay it . 

Even as I thought, my brain 
fighting the molasses of fear that 
trapped it like a fly, the comm gave 
the little throat-clearing burst that 
indicated it had acquired the Lang- 
ley carrier. I was trapped like a 
mouse in a bottle. I looked at the 
missile release button, backed away 
from it, sweat pouring from me in 



174 



GALAXY 




the dry cabin atmosphere. Outside 
the port Alice’s ship hung alien and 
beseeching. 

I must have fought my way 
blindly around the cabin because 
the next thing I was aware of was 
the missile button close to my hand. 
1 jerked away shuddering. The 
room was beginning to take on that 
ringing, metallic character of abso- 
lute fear. Alice, make contact now, 
help me . 

The comm opened communica- 
tion in the usual way, calling, “Alis- 
2, this is Langley . .” 

And again the missile button — 
the missile button became the focus 
of the room. As if the ship were 
rubber stretched out of shape to 
pour itself into the button, my vis- 
ion narrowed down to that one 
single disk in the entire universe . 
and again my hand was on it and 
this time, paralyzed with fear, I 
couldn’t tear it away. Langley was 
calling and I was trapped, so con- 
ditioned by the thing I feared that I 
was at the button even before they 
gave the order. “Final orders re- 
garding ET mission. Mansard . 
research section concludes . .’’ 
and my hand was on the button! 
My flesh was cold as death. I 
thought I’d vomit before they got 
it out . frantic, find a way, find a 
way in this last clonic instant before 
the word . 

“. concludes ET harmless. Do 
not harm in any way. Repeat, do 
not harm in any way. Final evalua- 
tion being faxed to you for contact 



procedures as you see fit. Acknow- 
ledge so far and we’ll start feeding 
you return data . .’’ 

The act in my throat like a word, 
a great black thing pushing into the 
world, into the room. Overwhelm- 
ing me. Hand on the button, now 
useless, unnecessary. Alice hun- 
dreds of yards away, watching, pul- 
sing emotions soothing over me. 

The act in the shape of a word: 
No! 

“No, you bastards, you can’t 
stop it now!” 

Push the button. 

Together we made a person . 

The impersonal missiles needled 
away, vibration shaking the ship. A 
part of my mind followed them, vis- 
ualizing their invisible path away 
from the ship. 

Together we made a person . 

Toward it. 

The fear, the nausea, the hatred. 
All united in an instant of time, be- 
fore the beginning, after the end. 
The result was peace. 

The missiles struck. 

The great black ship twinkled at 
a hundred points like a vast city, 
bloomed into an incredible blue- 
white flower that grew and grew 
into a sun. The great leglike exten- 
sions contracted convulsively. 

Contracted. Alice was her 
ship . 

The great gross insectlike thing 
was alive — had an exoskeleton like 
an insect’s. Had only one passen- 
ger. IVas the passenger. The radio 
was yammering, screaming things 



THE LANGLEY CIRCUIT, 



175 




I couldn’t make out and, obscenely, 
the huge hulk began to break up, 
pieces drifting and spinning away 
at their own velocities, trailing un- 
speakable thread-like jetsam. The 
emotions went on and on and on — 
they lived in my head, lived on in 
my head even after I smashed my 
hand raw and bloody on the button, 
again and again, laughing at the 



radio, the tears boiling from my 
face. Later they might even find 
me, drifting near the orbit. To- 
gether we made a person and the 
emotions went on somewhere and 
the thoughts that were Alice and 
me, far away behind the eyes, lac- 
erated and wrecked and beached on 
the rocks of love, lost, hopeless, and 
unutterable ... ★

When approached for a thumbnail bio- 
graphy of the kind usually featured in this 
space, Isaac Asimov told your editors he would 
rather supply a brief comment on the genesis 
of his THE GODS THEMSELVES. Here is 
that comment, in his own words. 

Before 1938. science fiction was written, 
very largely, by pulp-writer types who took 
time off from the western and crime stories 
that were their bread-and-butter. They did 
not know any science except the kind to be 
picked up from the Sunday supplements, 
but they did their best. In their hearts they 
knew that science was great — if they could 
only find out what it was. 

Then came a period, roughly from 1936 
to 1960, when science fiction often featured 
plausible science. Mind you. it was not ex- 
pected to teach science; it was supposed, 
however, to contain some sort of evidence 
that the writer knew something about 
science. 

This set the practitioners in the field a 
difficult task. To turn out good science 
fiction of the type prevalent in the 40s and 
50s, one had to be able to write with suf- 
ficient quality to be publishable and at the 
same time to know science sufficiently well 



to be respectable. The double requirement 
was not easy to meet. 

Once science fiction came to be in demand 
in the optical media, something had to give. 
What gave, of course, was science. There 
is now a new generation of science fiction 
writers, many of whom are "lit-major" 
types. They know nothing about science 
except what they pick up from each other's 
science fiction and. unlike the honest pulpers 
of the 30s, have no respect for genuine 
science. 

Weil, I haven't written any novels since 
1957 (except for the novelization of a 
screen-play, which doesn't count) so you can 
see I belong to the "hard" science fiction 
group. 

In fact, when I sat down to write another 
novel at last. I decided to have the courage of 
my convictions artd adopt the very narrowest 
and hardest definition of science fiction: 
"Science fiction is that branch of literature 
which deals with the future of science and 
scientists." The result was THE GODS 
THEMSELVES. 

I hope you like it. But if you don't, no hard 
feelings.
