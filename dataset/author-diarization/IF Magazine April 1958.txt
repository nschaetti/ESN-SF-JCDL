OF IF 



U 

ERE ARE nine great 
novelettes from the first 
six years of IF Magazine! 
Like The First World of IF,

facts and Imagination to 
provide a diversity of enter- 
tainment that will appeal to 
all science fiction lovers, 
from astronomers to zoo 
keepers. Here you will find 
such authors as Charles 
Beaumont, James Blish,

One of the most fascinating sciences 
in this super-modern world of to- 
day is still the study of human be- 
havior: How will a man act at a 
crucial moment under a given pat- 
tern of circumstances? Will he fol- 
low the dictates of custom, a life- 
long creed of family love and 
loyalty, a mold of heredity and en- 
vironment? Is the law of survival 
predominant against any situation, 
no matter who or what is involved? 

Just such a situation is posed in 
Homecoming, a taut, tense short 
story about a returning war veteran, 
with a truly “shock” ending. It’s a 
story that might have come from 
one of America’s more mature and 
experienced writers. Our assump- 
tion at first was that it did. But we 
were wrong. It’s a “first published” 
story (in America) by a young 
man named Miguel Hidalgo who 
is all of 15 years old. At first we 
didn’t believe it, but it was con- 
firmed and we found ourselves 
with not only a “first” but one that 
was written by the youngest writer 
(to our knowledge) ever to break 



into science fiction. 

Miguel Hidalgo is a story him- 
self. Of Spanish ancestry, he is a 
descendant of Simon Bolivar and 
was named for the Mexican liber- 
ator, Miguel Hidalgo. Born in Ca- 
racas, Venezuela, Miguel came to 
the United States, in a basket, at 
the age of two months. He began 
writing poetry at the age of five and 
before he was ten he had published 
numerous short stories as well as 
poetry. Miguel has traveled the 
world over with his mother, who 
was one of the first women diplo- 
mats from Venezuela to the United 
States. A trained athlete and judo 
expert, he is now a senior at Law- 
renceville School, preparing to en- 
ter Princeton next year in his quest 
for a degree in engineering. 

Miguel is “thrilled” about the 
publication of Homecoining in IF 
— his first U. S. sale. Well, we were 
kind of excited ourselves; it isn’t 
often a science fiction magazine gets 
a story that shows such stature from 
a world traveler of only 15 years! 

Another "first" for IF is Frank 
Riley’s exciting and suspenseful 
story A Question of Identity. The 
theme is something completely new 
to science fiction — one that dra- 
matically pits a miracle of medical 
surgery against a court of justice. 
In reading the story you will find 
that you are the jury. It gets my 
vote as the most original science fic- 
tion stoiy of 1958, and I’d certainly 
like to hear from you about your 
reaction . Incidentally, Frank 
has left his job as a radio-TV writer 
and executive and is now devoting 
full time to writing. And it was 



2 




good news indeed when he prom- 
ised IF further stories, for he is not 
only a fine craftsman; he also puts 
unusual effort and patience into re- 
search work. A Question of Identity 
is such an example of fine writing 
backed up by careful medical and 
legal research. 

Satellite news is still hot news, with 
more and more of the little moons 
being shot into their orbits — a pre- 
lude to space exploration, with per- 
haps the first manned satellite or 
satellite station a reality in our life- 
time. All of which makes Jinuny 
Gunn’s long novelette. Powder Keg, 
such a timely story. Here is a thrill- 
ing story of adventure, action and 
character study — one of the best by 
one of science fiction’s best known 
writers . Emsh did the cover for 
Powder Keg and he came up with 
a beauty . Ed, by the way, started 
drawing when he was in the first 
grade and, with time out for WW 
II, took all the art courses he could, 
continuing at the University of 
Michigan, from which he gradu- 
ated in 1949 with a major in art. 
After graduation he got married, 
went to Paris for a year’s study and, 
when he returned, in 1951, started 
illustrating science fiction. Ed’s wife, 
Carol, writes science fiction. They 
have two daughters who share their 
home movie hobby — 16 mm fan- 
tasy films.

. You can see we’re on an Inter- 
lingua “kick”, but this new scientific 
language has such possibilities and 
is so easy to learn that we feel the 
search for a truly international lan- 
guage has finally borne fruit. If 
you’re interested in Interlingua, 
drop us a note . The gals in 
science fiction circles are supposed 
to be few and far between. All we 
can say is “it don’t look like it.” 
According to our survey, the ladies 
form a goodly part of science fiction 
fandom. An example of how they 
feel about it can be found in “Hue

are from the distaff side . Note

. Got a “birthday” greeting (at 
least that’s when it arrived) from 
Charles Fontenay {Conservation, in 
this issue) in the form of a painting 
of a Martian scene. For the sands 
of Mars he mixed Earth sand with 
his oils and got a really unusual ef- 
fect! The more you look at it, the 
more it grows on you. 

By the way, this is the second issue 
in which IF has been using a dif- 
ferent kind of type for the logo 
panel on the cover and on the con- 
tents page. Have you noticed it? 
Do you think it says “IF” better 
than before? I’d like to know what 
you readers think. — ^jlq

BY JAMES E. GUNN 



The crew on the Little Wheel had commit- 



ted just about every offense in the book; and 



it was Phillips' duty to find out whether 



they were led by a patriot or a madman . 



POWDER KEG 



P hillips did not like this room. Another 
man would ha\e shrugged and let it pass, but 
Phillips, entirely aside from his profession, could 
not rest until the intuitive response had been 
isolated and analyzed. 

Besides, he had been neutral, at least, when he 
had been here once before, when another man sat 
behind the broad, polished walnut desk. 

It was a big room, even in comparison with 
rooms above. Here in the sub-Pentagon, it was 
gigantic, fully thirty feet long and twenty feet 
wide. 

The three doors, one leading to the anterooms 



4 




through which he had been ushered 
quickly, the others in the side walls 
to Communications and to Plot, 
were imitation walnut — a good 
imitation which could be detected 
only by looking at the deep glow 
of the polished desk. Phillips had 
the feeling that if he touched it his 
fingers would sink in up to the 
first joint. The doors were two-inch 
armor plate. 

The floor was covered from wall 
to wall by a deep-pile seamless 
gray carpet. Phillips’ shoes had 
made no sound as he walked across 
it and stood at attention in front 
of the desk. The only noise in the 
room was the muffled whisper of 
the air-conditioning as it blew fresh, 
chilled air through ceiling ducts. 

Phillips wondered if the General 
had forgotten he was here. Haven 
Ashley was sitting with his back to 
the desk — and to Phillips who was 
sitting beside it. He seemed to be 
studying the mosaic on the rear wall 
of his office, the only decorative 
touch in the room. The other walls 
were plain battleship gray. 

The mosaic was an authentic art 
piece. It had been constructed from 
minute slivers of colored glass, each 
glued painstakingly into position to 
form a faithful reproduction of the 
appearance of Earth from 1,000 
miles up. The continents were dull 
browns and yellows and greens 
overcast by a faint blue ; the oceans 
were grayish-blue, almost black. 

The mosaic was flat, but it gave 
the illusion of being a perfect half- 
sphere. Down here it was always 
night, but when the sun sank be- 
yond the Potomac for the surface 
dwellers above, the disk darkened 

6 



in Ashley’s office and became spot- 
ted with the reddish patches that 
were cities and the single stars that 
were brighter concentrations of 
light. And in the velvet dark around 
the planet real stars came out, un- 
winking brilliants obscured until 
then by the glow of the daylit 
Earth. 

There were no satellites in the 
sky. The scale was too small for 
the 24-hour orbit of the Big Wheel 
and too large for the Little Wheel 
to be more than a speck. In any 
case, the Little Wheel would not 
have appeared; that was where the 
artist had stood. 

The mosaic was strategically 
placed. To Phillips, as he had en- 
tered through the front wall door, 
it had looked like a halo around 
the head of General Haven Ashley. 
Ashley made the most of it. He was 
no angel. 

Phillips studied the back of the 
General’s head for the third time. 
Ashley was not a tall man, but he 
was big. He filled out the padded 
desk chair from armrest to armrest, 
his massive thighs bulging the trou- 
ser legs of the Air Force gray uni- 
form, his barrel chest straining the 
gilt buttons of the jacket. 

But these were things that Phil- 
lips had observed as he entered. 
All he could see now was the stiff, 
stubborn set of the shoulders, the 
red neck creased with a roll oiF fat, 
the gray hair brushed firmly into 
place against its natural tendency 
to bristle, and he thought: Whafs 
wrong with the room? It^s identical 
with the room when Pickrell was 
here, even to the stainless steel 
model of a three-stage shuttle that 

JAMES E. GUNN 




stood on the desk as a paperweight. 
A little neater, perhaps, hut I have 
no fetish for that. 

He had an incipient tendency to- 
ward claustrophobia. Perhaps it 
was that. He could feel the weight 
of five hundred feet of reinforced 
concrete pressing down upon his 
shoulders and his chest. Even the 
air seemed stale, although he knew 
it was purer than he could breathe 
on the streets of Washington. 

Perhaps it was the uncertainty 
of why Ashley had called him here. 
This was no courtesy call, as the 
other had been. This was business, 
and, for some reason, Ashley 
couldn’t talk about it. 

The General hadn’t called to his 
office an obscure Air Force psychol- 
ogist to discuss the psychologist’s 
opinion of the Air Force. Nor had 
he summoned help for his neu- 
roses; for Ashley that was impos- 
sible. 

It had to be the job. 

Ashley had inherited it six 
months ago. On his shoulders, like 
a modern Atlas, rested the sky. If 
he weakened, if he stumbled, the 
sky would fall, and humanity would 
be obliterated. 

Or perhaps, Phillips thought, it 
was the uncertainty of the world 
situation itself, which had wor- 
sened, certainly, in recent months. 

As Phillips leaned over the desk 
to stab out his cigarette in the 
spotless ash tray, Ashley swiveled 
in his chair, smacked the desk with 
the flat of his hand, and said vio- 
lently, “Intolerable!” 

Phillips froze, his hand poised 
above the tray, the cigarette burn- 
ing close to his fingers. 

POWDER KEG 



“Not you. Captain,” Ashley 
growled. “Put that thing out. You’ll 
have to give up smoking anyway.” 

Phillips stabbed twice and leaned 
back tensely. “Yes, sir?” What did 
he mean by that? 

Ashley scowled at the shiny 
paperweight. “What do you know 
about the world situation? Never 
mind; I’ll tell you in one word: 
desperate. It’s been desperate for 
forty years, but now it’s worse. 
Every puny little nation has a 
stockpile of atomic and hydrogen 
weapons; every last one of them is 
ready to blow your head ofT if you 
speak to them without the respect 
they think is their due.” 

“We’re sitting on a powder keg,” 
Phillips said boldly, “and everybody 
has a fuse in one hand and a piece 
of smoldering punk in the other. 
If one of us goes, we all go. You’d 
think they’d decide, eventually, to 
stamp out the punk and tear out 
the fuses.” 

Ashley’s bushy red eyebrows 
drew closer together, deepening the 
creases between them, and he asked 
sourly, “And how can you be sure 
everyone does it at the same time? 
Idealists! The last nation with a 
lighted match is the master of the 
world.” 

Phillips said slowly, “I thought 
that was the function of the Little 
Wheel — to keep everyone honest.” 

Ashley said gloomily, “It’s an 
edge. But what good is an edge in 
a situation like this? It’s like having 
a machine gun when the other 
guy’s got a .45. If the shooting 
starts, you’re just as dead.” 

“What about the satellite’s in- 

7 




spection facilities? Each two hours 
every spot on Earth comes within 
view.” 

“That! How do you see under 
the ground? You don’t. And that’s 
where the factories and IBM pits 
are now.” 

“Then there’s espionage — ” 

“And we’re right back where we 
started twenty-five years ago.” Ash- 
ley was solid and impassive in his 
chair, but his eyes brooded over 
the rocket-shaped ornament. “Have 
you ever been up there? Or out 
there, as the space nuts say.” 

“Yes, sir. Training cruises, and a 
weekend on the Big Wheel.” 

“The Little Wheel.” 

“No, sir.” 

“No. They won’t let you up 
there. They won’t let any psy- 
chologist up there.” Ashley’s voice 
dropped to a monotone, and he 
stared at the front door blindly. 
“When I took over command of 
the Air Force, I inherited a standing 
order that no psychologist would be 
allowed inside the Little Wheel. 
Why, Captain?” His voice grew 
stronger as he went on without 
waiting for an answer. “They were 
afraid of what a psychologist would 
find. They’re afraid he’d break up 
their playhouse. 

“Pickrell tried to get me to go 
along with his little game. ‘The 
witch doctors had their shot at 
my men in the Academy,’ he would 
say. T won’t have them messing 
around with my men on the job.’ 
Well, I’m in command now, and 
I’m running things my way.” 
Phillips said reassuringly, “There’s 
no doubt that the men out there 
are stable.” 



“Stable how?'' Ashley demanded 
fiercely. “As spaceman, maybe. But 
are they stable as executioners? 
They’ve got their finger on the trig- 
ger up there, man, and there’s no 
one to tell them when to shoot 
except a lunatic. Don’t interrupt 
me! We’re in communication, sure 
— for twenty minutes every two 
hours. And radio can be jammed. If 
that’s too obvious, an enemy can 
wait for sunspots. That fouls every- 
thing up but good! And astron- 
omers have no nationality. 

“Men have been up there for 
twenty years with their trigger 
fingers crooked. Not sensible men. 
Captain, not men trained in re- 
sponsibility and careful decisions, 
but men who must be more than a 
little cracked in the first place to 
go up there and stay.” There was 
an indefinable note of horror in 
Ashley’s deep voice. “Why there’s 
a man up there who hasn’t been 
back for twelve years — who hasn’t 
set foot 'on Earth since he went up! 
And he’s in command up there! 

“How stable is a man. Captain, 
who replies to an order from his 
superior officer: In my opinion this 
is impractical or We respectfully 
suggest that you consider possible 
alternatives? 

“That’s all. Captain. Pick up 
your orders as you go out. You will 
make a thorough survey of the 
psychological situation in the Little 
Wheel and report back when it is 
completed. When you come back, 
you will have an answer to this 
question: Is every man up there 
competent to exercise mature, un- 
erring judgment in cases involving 
the welfare of the entire Earth; is 



8 



JAMES E. GUNN 




every man up there incapable of 
cracking under the constant strain 
of sitting on a powder keg? 

“Oh, yes. Another thing. They’re 
building something up there behind 
the Wheel where we can’t see it. I 
want to know what it is.” 

Phillips looked at the General’s 
hands. The rocket model was be- 
tween them, and beneath the red 
hairs the hands were white with 
strain. The paperweight snapped. 
The sound was startling in the 
silence. Ashley looked down at his 
hands, surprised, and then con- 
temptuously tossed the pieces away. 

“Yes, sir,” Phillips said, thinking 
about the question he would have 
to answer when his job was done. 
There was only one possible an- 
swer: no. There was no group of 
men anywhere uniformly com- 
petent to exercise mature, unerring 
judgment, no man who would not 
crack under the stress of respon- 
sibility, if the responsibility were 
great enough. 

He could give Ashley his answer 
now, but that wasn’t what the 
General wanted. He wanted the 
odor of legality; he wanted evi- 
dence to present to the Secretary 
of Defense or the President or Con- 
gress. 

He was determined to break the 
Little Wheel just as he had broken 
the rocket model on his desk. 

“What kind of a man is the 
commander of the Little Wheel?” 
Phillips asked curiously. 

Ashley stared at him, his eyes 
large and angry. “I told you. He’s 
a madman. He’s utterly insane.” 

Phillips took his courage in his 
hands and said, “Why don’t you 

POWDER KEG 



order him in?” 

Ashley hesitated for a moment 
and then said in a voice that was 
almost inaudible, “What if he re- 
fused to come?” 



C APTAIN LLOYD PHILLIPS, 
M.D., U.S.A.F., sat in the 
leather-and-tile waiting room of the 
vast concrete spaceport at Cocoa, 
Florida, and watched Swan Lake 
on the wide, flat television screen 
against the far wall. The perform- 
ance was impossibly graceful, un- 
imaginably beautiful; never had 
human dancers looked so much like 
swans as they made long, flowing 
swoops through air that seemed as 
buoyant as a crystalline pool. 

The program was coming from 
the Big Wheel, poised eternally in 
its 22,000 mile orbit above the 
United States. The performance 
was taking place in a low-gravity 
studio of the fabulous Telecity not 
far from the commercial satellite, 
and reception was flawless. 

This was something Phillips 
could appreciate, something that 
the conquest of space had given 
him that repaid, in part, the sacri- 
fices in human life and labor and 
agony and Earth’s resources that 
could have been expended more 
profitably and more realistically. 

Phillips had nothing against 
spaceflight or the Big Wheel or 
the Little Wheel, either. He was 
intensely interested in them — as 
psychological phenomena. They 
had brought him into the Air 
Force, and they had kept him there. 

He wanted an answer to his own 
question: why? 



9 




Why did men join the Air Force’s 
Space Corps? What drove them 
into a brutal, alien environment 
where the best they could expect 
was hardship and a sterile life 
shortened by the physical damage 
of bad food, poisoned air, and the 
destruction of heavy primaries, the 
cumulative toll of acceleration 
pressures, and a fifty percent cer- 
tainty of insanity or violent dedth? 

And why did a race expend its 
substance on a grand but futile 
gesture? 

Spaceflight was impractical ; that 
was certain. It could never return 
half the investment of thought, 
sweat, blood, and money put into 
it. 

One day there would be a thick, 
scholarly book with Phillips’ name 
on it. Perhaps he would call it: 
Those Who Went Out, subtitled, 
“The Psychological Factors In- 
volved in the Career Decisions of 
Space Corps Volunteers, with case 
histories.” 

Or maybe: The Influence of the 
Broken Home on Twenty Space 
Corps Volunteers . 

Or, more simply: Spaceman — A 
Study of the Space Corps . 

After that would come the socio- 
logical treatise: Why Space? — A 
Consideration of the Sociological 
Necessities Behind the Develop- 
ment of Spaceflight. 

Phillips looked around the big 
waiting room. It was bare and 
almost antiseptically clean. He was 
alone except for a second lieuten- 
ant asleep in a far corner, his 
space helmet tilted forward to 
shade his eyes. 

Phillips looked back at the hu- 



man swans on the screen, but there 
were more urgent and immediate 
demands on his thoughts — for in- 
stance General Haven Ashley. 

His orders had included only 
twenty-four hours delay, but he had 
put them to good use. There was 
no one to say good-by to : his moth- 
er had died many years ago, his fa- 
ther wouldn’t give a damn, and he 
had played the field too carefully 
for any girl to wonder why he didn’t 
call. In a locked compartment of 
Phillips’ blue, nylon spacepack 
were the results of his 24-hours’ 
work : microfilms of the service and 
medical records of the Little 
Wheel’s entire personnel, from a 
newcomer of five months to an in- 
credible veteran of twelve years, a 
Colonel Danton whom General 
Ashley had insisted was “utterly in- 
sane.” 

Phillips had gone over them sev- 
eral times during the continually 
delayed take-off of the shuttle, but 
a thorough analysis would have to 
wait until he had met each man in- 
dividually and could correlate his 
observations with the impersonal 
details recorded in the emulsions. 
He did not want to prejudge any- 
one. 

It was a trait of conscientiousness 
that was a little annoying under 
the circumstances. The situation 
had been prejudged for him. But 
it was the way he worked, and he 
would have to endure it again, as 
he had suffered with it before. 

Phillips had used his orders as 
authority to dig into a more private 
file, that of Ashley himself. He 
knew more about Ashley now than 
Ashley knew about himself. He 



10 



JAMES E. GUNN 




would have liked confirmation, ab- 
solute certainty; a Rorschach blob 
test would have provided that. But 
he was as likely to get that from 
Ashley as Danton was to get a pro- 
motion, and he had enough. He 
knew why Ashley wanted to destroy 
the Little Wheel, had to destroy it. 
He had the key, a small notation on 
Ashley’s service record: Disquali- 
fied for space duty, space sickness. 

Ashley was one of that small 
minority of men who can not go 
weightless without complete sen- 
sory disorientation and a violent, 
unrelenting nausea. 

A lesser man would not have 
cared; a greater man w^ould have 
forgiven himself. But Ashley could 
do neither. He had sublimated it, 
and the defeat had become a driv- 
ing ambition that had carried him 
to the top of the Air Force through 
an incommensurable amount of un- 
relenting labor, constant politick- 
ing, and plain backstabbing. 

He had seen space heroes pro- 
moted over his head, and he had 
waited and worked and plotted 
through the commands of such 
space pioneers as Beauregard Finch 
and the recently invalided Frank 
Pickrell, through an era when 
spacemen could do no wrong. 

And he had clawed his way to 
the top. 

There were published articles in 
Ashley’s file subtly emphasizing the 
necessity of civilian control and of 
a balanced attack upon the military 
problem of defense against aggres- 
sion. 

Phillips could hear Ashley’s 
voice growling through such 
phrases as “the tail wagging the 

POWDER KEG 



dog” and “promotion policies 
should be influenced by considera- 
tions of all-around executive ability 
rather than spectacular and essen- 
tially meaningless feats of personal 
courage or mere physical agility. 
The balanced man with his feet 
planted firmly on the ground and 
his primary concern for the welfare 
of all the people must take pre- 
cedence over visionaries and im- 
practical idealists.” 

Ashley would be the first to deny 
that he harbored any hatred for 
the Space Corps of his command, 
and he would be telling the truth. 
But his subconscious mind had 
decided long ago that spaceflight 
was worthless. It was equated with 
a terrible experience of physical and 
psychic distress; imprinted on an 
inaccessible area of Ashley’s mind 
was the article of faith: Men are 
Earth creatures. 

The combination of genes that 
had determined Ashley’s inability to 
tolerate no-gravity had doomed the 
Little Wheel, and perhaps the 
whole future of spaceflight, almost 
fifty years ago. Chance. Just as it 
had been chance that the first man 
into space had been unable to re- 
turn, and his plight, capturing the 
world’s sympathy, had fueled the 
great psychological surge that had 
put the Little Wheel into space. 

To recognize the subconscious 
factors behind Ashley’s decision, 
however, was not to invalidate the 
decision itself. There are subcon- 
scious factors behind every decision. 
Ashley might be correct in spite of 
his prejudice. Phillips thought it 
very probably that Ashley was right. 

But it rankled a little that he 



11 




was going on a fool's errand. No 
answer he brought back — except 
an outright and unacceptable lie — 
could save the Little Wheel. Still, 
to Ashley and the world the trip 
was essential. 

The Little Wheel was going to 
die and spaceflight was going to die, 
but they had to die for a very good 
reason and with all due rites and 
ceremonies or they wouldn’t stay 
dead. 

‘T beg your pardon, sir,” the 
voice repeated. 

Phillips looked up, his thoughts 
shattered into shards that could 
never be quite pieced together 
again. A second lieutenant in the 
Space Corps stood respectfully in 
front of him, his blue space helmet 
dangling from one hand. Phillips 
glanced quickly at the far corner 
of the room, but it was empty, and 
looked back at the lieutenant. 

‘T beg your pardon, sir,” said 
the lieutenant for the third time, 
“but I was wondering — you don’t 
seem to be watching the screen” — 
he motioned boyishly toward the 
far wall — “if you’d mind if I 
switched channels.” 

He was a young man — slim, tall, 
broad-shouldered, and blond, his 
hair trimmed almost scalp short in 
the latest spacecut and he wore the 
most delightfully engaging grin. 
The kind of young man, in fact, for 
whom a uniform did the most and 
who did the most for a uniform. 
His face had sunburned and peeled 
and sunburned and peeled again 
until it was a light tan, but he 
would never develop any real im- 
munity to ultraviolet. His blue eyes

looked directly at Phillips without 
wavering. He was a completely nor- 
mal young man, a Space Corps re- 
cruiting poster come to life, and 
Phillips’ irritation collapsed. 

“Go right ahead,” Phillips said. 

In a moment the swans gave way 
to an amazing exhibition of acro- 
batics in zero gravity, but the young 
lieutenant, after he had returned 
and taken a pneumatic, leather 
chair next to Phillips, gave the per- 
formance none of his attention. He 
turned immediately to the psy- 
chologist and said eagerly, “Are 
you going out, sir?” 

“Yes.” 

“Your first?” 

Phillips smiled involuntarily. “To 
the Little Wheel.” 

“Then you have an experience in 
store.” 

“I expect you’re right.” Phillips 
smile broadened. 

“We’ll be going out together,” 
the boy said with great enthusiasm. 

“Fine.” Phillips grinned. 

The lieutenant looked sheepish. 
“I beg your pardon, sir. I talk too 
much, don’t I? It’s just that I’m 
returning from a short leave, and I 
can’t wait to get back. My name is 
Grant. Jack Grant.” 

Grant, Phillips thought. Both 
parents living, happily married. 
Normally affectionate family rela- 
tionship. Older brother a solar 
power engineer. Younger sister in 
high school. Normal adolescent sex- 
ual experiences. Six months service 
outside. Well-adjusted personality 
for his age when he left the Aca- 
demy. 

Phillips frowned. He didn’t fit 
into the pattern at all. Why had 

JAMES E. GUNN 




he gone out? “Lloyd Phillips/’ he 
said. 

Grant went on chattering un- 
abashed, telling Phillips about the 
Academy, about the Wheel, about 
his recent leave and the girl he had 
met and what they had done — 
stopping just short of the fine line 
between gentleman and jerk. His 
appetite for experience and his 
unquenchable good humor were in- 
fectious. He reminded Phillips of a 
playful puppy, bounding violently, 
his stub of a tail shaking his body 
all over with its gyrations. Phillips 
thawed once more in spite of him- 
self and gave the boy a verbal pat 
on the head occasionally. 

“What kind of man is Colonel 
Danton?” Phillips asked casually. 

Grant’s smile faded. He looked 
serious for a moment and said, “A 
very good officer, sir. A brilliant 
commander, completely loyal to his 
men and gets their loyalty in re- 
turn. Dedicated, sir. Works harder 
than anyone.” 

Phillips smiled encouragingly. 
“You can speak frankly. Jack. I’ll 
tell you something. Can you keep 
it under your hat?” He went on in 
a confidential murmur without 
waiting for an answer. “I’m a 
psychologist assigned to the Little 
Wheel. One of my jobs is to deter- 
mine whether Danton is emotion- 
ally qualified for a position whose 
responsibility is almost beyond 
comprehension.” That was true, 
certainly, although not in the sense 
that Grant would take it. “You 
can help me.” 

“You put me in a difficult posi- 
tion, sir. I’d like to help you, but 
I just can’t.”

Then there was something to tell. 
“This isn’t tattling. Jack. It’s much 
more important than that.” 

Grant shook his head grimly. 
“I’m sorry, sir. You’ll have to find 
out for yourself.” 

Phillips nodded. “That’s all right. 
I understand how you feel.” 

Grant could not stay withdrawn 
for more than a few moments. Soon 
he was baring his normal young 
soul as freely as ever. 

Fifteen minutes later Lieuten- 
ant Kars came through the broad, 
glass-doored entrance. He wore 
blue coveralls, a webbed flight belt 
across his chest, and a somber ex- 
pression on his dark face. 

Joseph Kars, 23, only child of a 
widowed mother — Phillips had time 
to think before Kars said curtly, 
“Let’s go. Captain. We can’t wait 
all night.” 

“About time,” Phillips said gen- 
tly. “I’ve been waiting for two 
days.” 

Kars looked at him out of cold, 
black eyes. “It’s never about time, 
Captain. It’s time or it isn’t. Pick 
up the Captain’s spacepack, 
Grant,” he snapped. He turned on 
his heel. 

Phillips turned quickly to pick 
up his own luggage, but Grant al- 
ready had it in his hand. He grinned 
at the psychologist. 

Philfips looked at him helplessly 
and back at Kars as if comparing 
the two and then followed the un- 
relenting back into the night. 



HEY WALKED across the 
pitted, concrete landing field 
toward the skyscraper-tall three- 




13 




stage rocket, broad-finned at the 
bottom, its wings even broader at 
the top. Grant was some twenty 
yards behind. Phillips didn’t look 
at the shuttle. He was looking at 
Kars. 

There is a sameness to them, he 
thought. A dedication, a mania that 
molds their features, a look to the 
eyes as if they were fashioned for 
seeing more distant vistas than 
other men. There were all shapes 
and colors and faces, but the differ- 
ences only emphasized their kin- 
ship. They came from identical 
molds labeled: ‘‘Experiment — Ho- 
mo Spatium.'’ 

All except Grant. He was too 
normal. He didn't belong. Phillips 
felt a surge of affection for Grant, 
as if they were brothers who had 
just recognized that they were 
among aliens. 

“What held us up, Joe?” Phil- 
lips asked casually. 

“If you don’t mind. Captain, 
call me Kars or Lieutenant.” 

“All right. Lieutenant. What was 
the trouble?” 

“No trouble. Captain.” 

“Two days delay, and you call 
it no trouble?” 

Kars glanced at him silently as 
if weighing Phillips’ powers of un- 
derstanding. Then he pointed at 
the shuttle, standing tall and par- 
tially illuminated on the otherwise 
dark field. But there was life 
around. Somewhere animals roared 
in their testipg frames, spitting 
flame and power, shaking the 
ground. It was like walking through 
a zoo at night, wondering if the 
bars are strong enough. 

“That’s a beast there. Captain,” 

14 



Kars said flatly, “a savage, viciously 
unpredictable beast straining at a 
leash, waiting to kill me if I over- 
look one small item in an endless 
list of precautions. 

“I’m in command of that thing. 
It doesn’t move until I’m satisfied 
that it’s ready. Every relay, every 
pump, every gauge must be work- 
ing perfectly; every connection 
must be solid; every line must be 
clean. Or blam! No more crew, no 
more Joseph Kars, no more Cap- 
tain Lloyd Phillips. And no cargo 
for the Wheel. 

“We inspect every part person- 
ally, Captain. Does that surprise 
you?” 

“No. Something was wrong 
then?” 

“We weren’t sure everything was 
right.” 

“I’m glad you told me. I would 
hate to be forced to report that 
there was deliberate delay in the 
execution of my orders. General 
Ashley wanted me on the Little 
Wheel yesterday.” 

Kars told Phillips what he could 
do with General Ashley. “Besides,” 
he concluded mildly, “there’s al- 
ways the possibility of sabotage. 
One of the crew must stand guard 
over the shuttle at all times.” 

“Enemy sabotage?” Phillips said, 
surprised. 

Kars’ unreadable black eyes 
looked at him. “After the red tape 
you went through, you think an 
enemy agent could get in here?” 

“Did Colonel Danton tell you 
that? What’s wrong with him?” 

“Captain,” Kars said icily, “we 
didn’t have to be told. As for the 
Colonel — he’s the greatest man 

JAMES E. GUNN 




who ever lived!” 

As they climbed up concrete 
steps onto the takeoff platform, the 
ship had grown so tall that it 
seemed about to topple over on 
them. They approached the giant 
hammerhead crane beside the 
shuttle. Grant’s footsteps clicked 
behind them. 

There was a smell of old fire to 
the platform mingled with the 
sharp odor of acid and the mingled 
stench of old chemicals and oil. 
“You don’t like me, Lieutenant,” 
Phillips said bluntly. “Why?” 

“I don’t dislike you, Captain,” 
Kars said without expression. “I 
don’t feel anything about you at 
all except for a general distaste for 
all witch doctors. I had enough of 
them at the Academy. They ask 
the wrong questions. Captain. 

“If I resent you, it’s because 
you’re taking up space that might 
be occupied by someone useful. If 
we didn’t have to lift you, we 
could lift another bottle of oxygen. 
We can breathe oxygen. Captain.” 
“And I’m dead weight,” Phillips 
said cheerfully. “Okay, Lieutenant. 
Man proposes, but the Air Force 
disposes. I’ve got my orders, too, 
and I can stand it if you can.” 
Grant joined them in the eleva- 
tor that was part of the crane’s 
framework. It lifted them up the 
side of the ship, and they climbed 
through the thick, square doorway. 
Kars swarmed up a ladder toward 
four helmeted heads; Phillips fol- 
lowed more slowly. Grant stowed 
away Phillips’ spacepack before he 
ascended. 

Kars motioned Phillips into a 
gimbaled chair. “That’s yours,” he 

POWDER KEG 



said, and went on to the pilot’s 
chair above. 

With quick, sure competence, 
Phillips buckled himself in, chuck- 
ling softly. So this was the way it 
was going to be: a test for the 
psychologist. 

Let them have their fun, he 
thought. They'll need it. 

After the interminable drone of 
the check-off, the lifting of the 
shuttle took him by surprise. Kars 
gave no warning on the intercom; 
there was suddenly more than half 
a ton of lead sitting on his chest, 
squeezing the breath out of his 
body, refusing to let him draw in 
more. 

His head was turned slightly to 
the side, forced deep into the cush- 
ions, and he could not move it. 
Outside the night flamed red and 
yellow and white, until he had to 
shut his eyes against the brilliance. 
The ship trembled and shuddered 
and shook, and the roaring of the 
rocket motors was everywhere, per- 
vading every tortured cell of his 
body. 

After a brief surcease, in which 
Phillips noticed that the light out- 
side had disappeared and his blind- 
ed eyes could see only a sooty 
blackness, the weight descended 
again. This time, as the second 
stage took up the job of accelera- 
tion, the pressure lasted for almost 
a minute. 

As the second stage cut off and 
dropped away, Phillips took a deep, 
rasping breath. By comparison, the 
third-stage acceleration was almost 
unnoticeable. 

Suddenly, then, the all-pervading 
vibration was gone. The motors 



15 




were silent, and Phillips was falling. 

He gripped the chair arms with 
clawing hands. This is illusion, he 
told himself desperately. What sent 
his senses reeling into the eternal 
night was the absence of accelera- 
tion pressure, was the release of 
the ear’s otolith organs from the 
tug of gravity . 

His stomach rebelled. Bitter 
acids spurted into his mouth . 

Free fall, he told himself. In 
that sense 1 am falling, as all men 
fall when there is no resistance to 
the pull of gravity. But in actuality 
1 am coasting upward into the 
abyss of night, protected from its 
hungry vacuum, from its extremes 
of heat and cold, by sturdy metal 
walls and the power of man's en- 
gineering and craftsmanship. 

Falling, true, but falling — up! 

Phillips took a few deep breaths 
and a sensation of unusual well- 
being spread through his body. He 
was one of the lucky ones. After a 
few uncomfortable moments of 
transition, zero gravity was a de- 
light to him. 

Phillips looked around. Grant 
was beside him, on the other side 
of the ladder, but the boy was 
having more difficulties. His face 
was white, and his jaw was set 
grimly. 

The earphones popped, and 
Kars’ sardonic voice came to Phil- 
lips clearly. “Okay, Captain?” 

“Very nice, Lieutenant,” Phillips 
said cheerfully. “Best lift I can re- 
member.” And that, he thought, 
should end the hazing from that 
quarter. 

Then there was no time for talk : 
the crew was too busy with prob- 



lems of navigation and determining 
the final burst of acceleration which 
would stabilize the ship’s orbit at 
1,075 miles out and locating the 
Little Wheel. 

For Phillips the time passed 
swiftly. Grant was still in no mood 
for conversation, but the psy- 
chologist watched the stars through 
the clear, plastic canopy. They had 
always fascinated him; they were 
so different from the twinkling, fil- 
tered, untouchable fireflies of 
Earth’s night. Out here — Phillips 
recognized the transition in his vo- 
cabulary — they were clear, steady, 
many colored, and almost within 
reach. 

That, too, was illusion. As a 
psychologist he knew that Ashley’s 
article of faith was fact: Men are 
Earth creatures. Nowhere else 
could Man exist in more than a 
marginal, half-starved sense. No 
other soil would nourish him; no 
other world would ever be home. 

The two artificial satellites were 
special cases. They were Earth en- 
vironment canned and transported 
at incredible expense into orbits 
around the home world, and when- 
ever the psychological pressures 
grew unbearable, a man could look 
out and see the warm, fertile bosom 
of his mother only hours away. 

A new voice broke into Phillips’ 
reverie. It wasn’t one of the crew 
members; he had become attuned 
to them. This voice was carefree, 
almost chuckling. 

“Okay, Joe,” it said. “You’ve got 
your bearings; don’t spare the hy- 
drazine. And be careful with the 
supercargo.” It laughed. “We 
wouldn’t want anything to happen 



16 



JAMES E. GUNN 




to the General’s errand boy.” 

The freed third stage had slid 
into sunlight. The glare was daz- 
zling, blotting out the stars. The 
Earth — below? above? — spanned 

half the sky. It recalled to Phillips 
the mosaic in General Ashley’s of- 
fice. The difTerence was that this 
was real, and he was Outside, 
floating 1,075 miles above the world 
beneath with its blue-black oceans, 
its thin-cotton clouds covering al- 
most half the planet, its dull, 
brownish-yellowish-greenish conti- 
nents distorted almost beyond rec- 
ognition at the edges of the hemis- 
phere, all framed by a whitish haze. 
This was real, and it was majestic 
and frightening. 

On the other side, the gleaming- 
white, two-spoked Wheel, spinning 
slowly, was a triumphant thing, 
dazzling the eyes where the sun 
burned back from its rim. It was 
a silver ring for a giant’s finger 
waiting on the black-velvet cushion 
of the night. 

Phillips waited in his spacesuit 
for the sausage-shaped taxi that 
would take him to it. Not far from 
the Wheel was a vast circle of 
coated metal, shining mirrorlike in 
the sunlight. But it could not be 
a mirror — not a weapon for con- 
centrating the sun’s rays on an en- 
emy city like a burning glass on an 
ant hill nor a reflector for lighting 
the friendly night or warming the 
polar ice. It was pointed at right 
angles to Earth. 

Beyond the Wheel was another 
structure. Phillips couldn’t make 
out what it was supposed to be ; the 
Wheel concealed much of it. But it 



was an ungainly contraption of 
rocket motors and spherical tanks 
bolted flimsily together. 

A man was waiting in the zero- 
gravity Hub to help Phillips out of 
his cumbersome suit, a man with a 
hard, deeply tanned face and snow- 
white hair — cosmic ray damage to 
follicles did that. He wore the loose- 
fitting coveralls of an ordinary 
spaceman. They were ragged at 
cuff and neck, and there was no in- 
signia. 

Non-reg uniform, Phillips noted. 
Sloppy at that. 

The man was slim and a little 
over medium height as near as 
Phillips could judge without his 
accustomed yardsticks of perspec- 
tive and familiar surroundings. The 
contrast of his colorless hair and 
eyebrows with the dark face was 
dramatic. In fact, the man looked 
surprisingly like ailing General 
Pickrell, even to the cataract- 
flecked eyes, but then he grinned 
and the resemblance vanished. 

“Captain Phillips?” he said eas- 
ily, floating without a handhold in 
mid-air. “Colonel Amos Danton at 
your service.” 

Phillips gave a start of surprise 
and tried to cover it by shooting 
out a hand to meet Danton’s. But 
it overshot its mark and had to 
fumble its way back with an air of 
embarrassment. Muscles don’t learn 
quickly, Phillips noted. 

“Glad to meet you. Colonel Dan- 
ton,” he said, “but I want to cor- 
rect one misapprehension. I’m a 
little too old to be an errand boy.” 

“I hadn’t thought there was any 
age limit on it.” Danton grinned. 
“But seeing you now, I’m inclined 



POWDER KEG 



17 




to agree. Don’t mind me. I’m frank 
to the point of brutality.” 

“Then I hope you’ll continue to 
be frank with me, Colonel. I have 
a difficult job to do, and I’ll need 
all the help I can get.” 

“I know.” 

“You know what my job is?” 
Phillips asked sharply. 

“Shall I quote your orders?” 
“Spies?” 

“Call them spies if you like.” 
Danton’s face hardened. “There are 
spies around me, now. Saboteurs. 
Enemies.” He took a deep breath 
and brought his voice back to its 
original lightness. He shrugged. 
The gesture spun him gently, but 
he stopped it almost without effort. 
“We think of them as grounded 
spacemen. Once a spaceman always 
a spaceman.” 

“What would you call me?” 
“Neither fish nor fowl. Captain. 
You’re an ocean dweller with air 
sacs capable of absorbing oxygen 
from the atmosphere, but you 
haven’t made up your mind 
whether it wouldn’t be better, after 
all, to crawl back into the secure, 
buoyant womb of the sea.” 

“I disagree with your analysis 
and your analogy. Colonel.” 

“That’s your privilege. But all 
this formality makes me nervous.” 
Almost as he spoke, his eyelid 
jerked. “We don’t worry much out 
here about spit and polish. My 
name is Amos. I’ll call you Lloyd. 
Okay?” 

Phillips nodded agreeably and 
began a series of lazy somersaults 
that he didn’t try to stop because 
he didn’t know how. Perhaps it 
would not be as difficult as he had 



imagined, he thought. Danton 
might be as cracked a pot as Ashley 
believed him or as great a man as 
Kars had called him or as tainted 
as Grant had suggested, but he had 
no obvious chip on his shoulder. 
Phillips had a shrewd idea how to 
turn him into an active ally. Feel- 
ing a little silly about the somer- 
saults, he said, “If you know my 
job, then I hope you’ll see that I get 
the cooperation it demands.” 

“Sure,” Danton said. “You came 
out to tear down the Wheel. Go to 
it. If you can do it, the Wheel 
doesn’t deserve to be out here. 
You’ll get cooperation. And if any 
of the boys give you trouble, come 
to me. They don’t like you, you 
know. Not only are they rather at- 
tached to this old Wheel, but you’re 
going to slow down a job they know 
is important, and you’re going to 
occupy premium space and con- 
sume valuable oxygen and food.” 
His, eyelid jerked. “But they’ll co- 
operate — or else.” 

As if he had suddenly tired of the 
conversation, he caught Phillips’ 
hand as it came around and gave it 
a quick pull which stopped the 
somersaults and shot Phillips into 
one of the pipelike spokes. Phillips 
reached out just in time to catch a 
rung of the rope ladder that lined 
the side of the tunnel. Danton, re- 
bounding from the other side of the 
Hub with bent knees thrusting, was 
beside him immediately. 

“Danton coming through on B 
with one hundred sixty pounds of 
witch doctor,” he said into a micro- 
phone. To Phillips he added, “Let’s 
get you settled. I’m giving you the 
cabin next to mine. It’s small and 



18 



JAMES E. GUNN 




uncomfortable, but it’s the best we 
have. And you’ll want the privacy, 
I imagine. Out here that’s our 
scarcest commodity,” 

“Not too much privacy,” Phillips 
said quickly as they pulled them- 
selves along the ladder, their weight 
increasing as they approached the 
rim. “I’ll want free access to every 
part of the Wheel. I’ll set up a 
schedule of private interviews for 
everyone out here, but I want to eat 
with the men.” 

“They’ve endured a lot of things. 
I guess they can survive that, too. 
You’re free to go wherever you 
wish, but the weight control officer 
has orders to search you if you leave 
your room. Saboteurs, you know.” 

T he cabin was small beyond 
belief. Beside it the third-class 
quarters of the Big Wheel were 
models of luxury. Here there was 
space for a bunk, a table, and a 
chair; when the bunk was folded 
against the wall, the table and the 
chair could be let down. When all 
of them were out of the way, a man 
could take two paces if he didn’t 
step too freely. 

If the legend on the door were to 
be believed, it had housed the mis- 
sile-control officer. 

For all its privations, it was a 
room with a view. When an outside 
viewport cover was lifted, the uni- 
verse was Phillips’ neighbor, a dark 
infinity scattered lavishly with 
friendly, many colored lanterns to 
light the way, or alternately, as the 
Wheel turned, the great, beautiful 
disk of the Earth was before him, 
close enough to grasp in a man’s 

POWDER KEG 



two hands if there were not thick 
glass in the way. 

Occasionally, beyond a thin, 
metal partition, Phillips heard Dan- 
ton moving softly in what must 
have been a twin cabin to his. 
Privacy! Phillips thought wryly and 
was glad he had an ear mike for his 
recorder. 

If his cabin was tiny, the crew’s 
quarters were impossible. Like flop- 
house patrons that rented louse-rid- 
den beds by the hour, the crew slept 
in “hot” bunks, and when they slid 
into them their faces were no more 
than six inches from the bulging 
canvas of the bunk above. 

There were, at least, no lice. 

The food, chiefly frozen meals to 
save shipping space, the services of 
a cook, and the room necessary for 
a kitchen, was surprisingly good, 
but even eating in shifts couldn’t 
prevent continual overcrowding of 
the minute dining hall. It was al- 
most necessary to eat in unison to 
avoid an inextricable tangling of 
arms. 

An eternal line waited for a 
chance at the shower or the sanitary 
facilities, and recreational oppor- 
tunities were practically non-exist- 
ent. Occasionally there were swift 
games of no-gravity handball in the 
Hub — against all regulations, but 
even Danton joined in — and riskier 
games outside in spacesuits or the 
two-jet taxis. Inevitably, there were 
card games, checkers, and chess in 
the bunks, and probably bull ses- 
sions. 

The last was surmise. The men 
didn’t talk when Phillips was 
around. They glanced at him cold- 
ly or ignored him. 



19 




Even when he called them to 
his carefully prepared cabin — the 
Rorschach clay on the table, the 
recorder fastened underneath — they 
were sullen and monosyllabic. They 
knew what he was there for, and 
they resented him violently. Only 
Danton’s explicit orders made them 
report at all. 

Phillips got it all down on tape. 
Ashley would love it, he thought. 
They all sounded like depressives 
on the verge of becoming manic. 
None of them realized that the clay 
they were working in their fingers — 
since they were all compulsives they 
picked up whatever was available 
to keep their hands occupied — re- 
vealed them more surely than any- 
thing they could have said. 

Alumbaugh, Baker, Chapman, 
Dean — straight down the roster, 
Phillips diagnosed them by the 
blobs they left behind. Psychology 
had taken giant strides in the last 
quarter century; Rorschach blots 
interpreted by the patient had be- 
come Rorschach blobs manipulated 
unconsciously by the patient, and 
Phillips could classify the crew- 
members with certainty: schizoids, 
cycloids, paranoids, homosexuals, 
sadists, incipient homicides . psy- 
chopaths all. 

In a sense, part of it was unfair. 
Morale was better than it should 
have been among men working, 
many of them at manual labor, for 
twelve to sixteen hours a day and 
living under conditions that would 
have been considered cruel and un- 
usual punishment for the most 
hopeless criminal. On the other 
hand, it was not as good as it could 
have been under the guidance of 



an experienced psychologist. 

Even then Phillips would not 
have trusted them with decisions 
involving the safety of a small city. 
There was no longer any doubt in 
his mind: they were unstable per- 
sonalities in an artificial and unnat- 
ural environment. 

If there was any powder keg, this 
was it — waiting for a spark to set it 
off and blow up the world it was 
supposed to protect. 

There was only one way out : the 
conquest of space would have to be 
sacrificed to the security of the race 
of man. 

The taped interviews, his own 
notes and observations, the mini- 
pictures of the blobs — ^kept under 
tamperproof lock when he was out 
of the cabin — were perhaps enough 
to satisfy the jury that would de- 
cide the Wheel’s fate, although lay- 
men looked on the blobs with the 
suspicion illiterates had once had 
for books. 

Phillips wanted more — the casual 
conversations of the crew when 
they thought they were alone, for 
instance, but he wasn’t electrician 
enough to rig bugs in the sleeping 
quarters and the mess hall. In any 
case, they were never clear. 

Phillips prowled the Rim with 
his problem, looking for something 
overt, for something he could point 
to and say, “See? Here a man has 
cracked under the pressure. Here 
he has done this or forgotten to do 
that in an unconscious dramatiza- 
tion of his paranoid aggression wish 
or his suicidal impulse. Here, but 
for chance, might be the act that 
destroyed every living thing on 
Earth.”

JAMES E. GUNN 




But there was nothing to point 
to. 

As neurotic as the crew members 
certainly were, as psychopathic as 
many of them seemed to be, on the 
job they did only those things they 
were supposed to do and forgot 
nothing. The areas of the Little 
Wheel vital to the welfare of the 
men within — and what wasn’t? — 
were kept in show-room condition, 
more immaculate and in better re- 
pair than the men who tended 
them. 

The power room, supplied by 
solar radiation focused on a mer- 
cury boiler by a troughlike solar 
mirror, was spotless. The air-condi- 
tioning system, which extracted 
moisture and carbon dioxide from 
the air, fed in fresh oxygen, and 
maintained pressure throughout the 
satellite, was tended as solicitously 
as a baby. The pump room 
gleamed, and the water recovery 
plant gurgled contentedly at its job 
of making wastes potable. 

Then Phillips reached Earth-ob- 
servation. 

The screens were alive, but the 
telescope had been allowed to drift 
oflf-center. The view of the area be- 
neath the Wheel was blurred and 
meaningless. 

There was only one crewman on 
duty, and he was asleep in a chair 
near the bulkhead that separated 
Earth-observation from what had 
once been the weather room and 
was now sleeping quarters for 
thirty-two men. 

Phillips grasped the man roughly 
by one shoulder and shook him 
awake. As soon as the man’s eyes 

POWDER KEG 



fluttered, Phillips snapped, “Name 
and rank!” 

Dazedly the man sprang to his 
feet. “Spaceman First Class Miguel 
Delgado, s-sir!” he stammered. 
Then he recognized Phillips. He 
jerked his shoulder free and settled 
back into his chair. “Oh, it’s the 
witch doctor,” he said insolently. 
“Are you on duty here?” 

“Yes, Captain.” 

“Just you?” 

“You don’t see nobody else, do 
you?” 

“Do you know the penalty for 
falling asleep on watch?” 

“Whatever the Colonel says.” 
“The Colonel has nothing to do 
with this. The penalty is automatic : 
courtmartial, followed by whatever 
the court decides is appropriate, up 
to and including death.” 

“The Colonel will say,” Delgado 
repeated stubbornly. “Whatever the 
Colonel says is right.” 

“Your loyalty to Colonel Danton 
is admirable. It’s too bad it isn’t 
matched by an equal loyalty to your 
country and the Air Force.” 

“What’s the use making a big 
fuss over a little nap?” Delgado 
shrugged. ,“It ain’t like it was im- 
portant.” 

“There’s nothing more impor- 
tant. What if you didn’t see a mis- 
sile base below because of your lit- 
tle nap? By this time those missiles 
could be over Washington or your 
own home town.” 

Delgado looked amazed. “Who’d 
want to do anything like that?” 
Phillips gave up. “Where’s the 
missile-control officer?” 

“The who?” 

“The missile-control officer. Ac- 

21 




cording to your table of organiza- 
tion, he’s in charge of Earth obser- 
vation.” 

Delgado shook his head stupidly. 
“Never heard of him. You better 
ask the Colonel.” 

“I’ll do that!” Phillips swung 
away, trying not to see Delgado’s 
smothered yawn. 

It was time to see Danton. 

Phillips had only a few steps to 
go. Beyond the next door was 
the little-used celestial-observation 
room. Sitting motionless in front of 
one of the magnifying screens was 
Danton. 

Phillips closed the door carefully 
behind him. “Colonel!” he said 
sharply. 

Not looking away from the 
screen, Danton gestured for silence. 
“Shhhh!” 

Phillips took two quick steps to- 
ward him. “Amos! This is impor- 
tant!” He glanced at the screen. 
On it was a vivid enlargement of a 
quadrant of Mars, rosy and sharp, 
the long-disputed canals clearly de- 
lineated. 

“Oh, it’s you, Lloyd,” Danton 
said casually. He swung around in 
his chair. “What can I de for you?” 

Grimly Phillips said, “A better 
question is: What can I do for 
you?” 

“Okay,” Danton said agreeably. 
“What can you do for me?” 

“I can report a disrespect for 
authority in your command, a de- 
teriorating morale situation, and a 
possible disaster in the making.” 

“Well, now,” Danton said lazily, 
his eyelid jerking, “I guess that’s 
not new. There never has been 
much respect for authority on the 



Little Wheel. Out here a uniform 
and an insignia aren’t enough; a 
man must earn respect on his own. 
The morale has always been de- 
teriorating. And there’s always a 
disaster in the making. Anything 
else?” 

“I just found a crewman asleep 
on watch.” Phillips watched Dan- 
ton closely. The reaction, for once, 
was appropriate. 

Danton came out of the chair in 
one fluid movement. “Where?” 
“Earth-observation.” 

Danton sank down again. “Oh! 
That’s too bad.” 

“Is that all you can say — ^it’s too 
bad?” 

“Who was it?” 

“Miguel Delgado — a resentful, 
unstable personality who should 
never have been given such re- 
sponsibility in the first place.” 
“Well, Lloyd, we have to use 
what we’ve got. I don’t think we 
should be too hard on him. He’s 
just put in eight hours at hard labor 
on construction work outside, and 
he’s got a six-hour stretch in a bor- 
ing, unimportant job — ” 
“Unimportant?” 

“Unimportant to him.” 

Phillips snapped, “In the Air 
Force I belong to enlisted men 
aren’t judges of the importance of 
their jobs.” 

“I suppose he knows it’s unim- 
portant to me, too.” 

Phillips studied the tanned face 
under the white stubble. It was a 
face aged beyond its years. Phillips 
wished he could get behind it, 
wished he could get Danton into 
his cabin with the recorder under- 
neath the table and the Rorschach 



22 



JAMES E. GUNN 




clay on top, wished he could be cer- 
tain that Danton was as paranoid 
as he seemed. 

The martinet approach hadn’t 
worked. He would have to proceed 
on the assumption of paranoia. “I 
don’t understand you, Amos. Out 
here you’re got the toughest job a 
colonel could hold in the Air Force, 
maybe the most responsible job any- 
where, and you don’t seem im- 
pressed at all.” 

Danton said dryly, “Maybe my 
values are a little different.” 

“The only possible conclusion is 
that twelve years out here without 
rest or leave has affected your judg- 
ment.” Danton started to speak 
and Phillips held up a hand as he 
hurried to fire the thunderbolt he 
had been saving for this moment. 
“You needn’t be surprised that I 
know about the standing orders 
General Pickrell left in your file. 
But you should know this: those 
orders have been torn up. You can 
go home whenever you wish.” 

For a moment Danton stared 
blankly at Phillips, and then he 
started to laugh. The laughter was 
not insane; it was not even hysteri- 
cal. It was the laughter of a man 
who has just heard something in- 
describably funny. 



F inally danton wiped the 

tears from his eyes and asked 
weakly, “You think you can buy 
me, do you? You think for a few 
lousy weeks on Earth you can get 
my help to break up the Little 
Wheel?” 

“That wasn’t — ” Phillips began, 
but Danton’s hand was raised. 



“I listened to you; now you lis- 
ten to me. Sure the Fish — I beg 
your pardon — General Pickrell put 
those orders in my file, and for a 
good reason, a reason I may tell 
you some day. Later it became our 
own personal joke. But he never of- 
fered to remove them, and I never 
asked him to. Why should I want 
to go home? My mother died two 
years after I came out — yes, Lloyd, 
I came from a broken home — and 
there’s nothing left there I’m inter- 
ested enough to cross the Wheel for. 
Go home. Captain? I am home.” 

“And for that reason, Amos, you 
aren’t a good risk.” 

“Explorers have never been good 
risks.” 

“I’m not talking about insurance 
risks; I’m talking about the risk to 
Earth.” 

Danton grinned. “Don’t go on! I 
can repeat everything Sackcloth 
told you. God knows he’s sent it to 
me often enough: ‘Under no con- 
ditions will you initiate independent 
action, no matter what the provoca- 
tion or the state of communications. 
You will wait for orders from su- 
perior authority. I don’t need to tell 
you, Captain, that I am not satis- 
fied with a situation that includes 
the possibility of ultimate decision 
by man qualified for it neither by 
character nor by training.’ ” 

Danton’s voice dropped. He 
stared blindly at the lighted screen 
in front of him. “Ashley has a nasty 
way of projecting his own desires 
and character into his mental con- 
cept of his subordinates. Who does 
he think is going to fire a missile 
without orders from Inside, and 
confirmation of those orders, and 



POWDER KEG 



23 




reconfirmation?” 

“A neurotic man might. Anyone 
out here might crack under the 
strain of sitting with his finger eter- 
nally on the trigger. Even you, 
Amos — as certain as you are that 
space is your home — you might 
crack. And you have the power 
here to make yourself the dictator 
or the destroyer of the world.” 

That seemed to cheer Danton up. 
“Dictator, perhaps — but for how 
long? There are neuroses and neu- 
roses, Lloyd; some are dangerous, 
and some are functional. A fear of 
heights, now, has kept a lot of peo- 
ple from taking the long plunge. I 
happen to think that our kind of 
neurosis is only dangerous when it 
is penned up.” 

Carefully Phillips said, “Unfor- 
tunately, you aren’t a trained psy- 
chologist. My own opinion is that 
the Little Wheel is dangerously 
close to instability. You take great 
pains to make every part of the 
Wheel balance with the part dia- 
metrically opposite. It’s even more 
important that the men inside, who 
must make the decisions, are care- 
fully balanced. 

“In a command distinguished by 
slovenly watch procedures, inso- 
lence, and disrespect for authority, 
you have managed to inspire great 
personal loyalty among your men. 
Perhaps you can keep them under 
control. But I ask you to consider 
thisr what would happen if you 
were killed or suddenly recalled?” 
Phillips suddenly remembered Ash- 
ley’s haunted eyes as he had mut- 
tered, “What if he refused to 
come?” 

Hastily Phillips went on, “These 

24 



men are nervous, irritable, and un- 
stable. The Wheel is a powder keg 
waiting for a spark.” 

Danton turned his head to look 
squarely at Phillips, his lips smiling 
but his flecked eyes hard. “Nervous, 
sure ; irritable, maybe ; but unstable, 
unh-unh! A force released is always 
stable. It’s only a force contain^ 
that is unstable, and only that force 
will explode. 

“Sure we’re nervous, but we’ve 
got a right to be. We’re prey to a 
dozen hazards men Inside never 
know. We’re eternally conscious of 
our environment, because we have 
to bring it all with us. We live in a 
hollow world two hundred and fifty 
feet across; its walls are not much 
more than an inch thick, and most 
of that is air. We face imminent 
death from such exotic causes as 
sunburn, meteoric missiles, asphyxi- 
ation, and radiation poisoning. 

“If I don’t die violently, Lloyd, I 
wpn’t live to be sixty years old. To 
me it doesn’t matter. I wouldn’t be 
anywhere else for a lifetime twice 
as long. This nervousness you speak 
of — I call it awareness of danger, 
and as long as we stay nervous, 
we’ll stay alive, most of us. 

“They don’t need to be afraid of 
us, Inside. We’re trying too hard to 
stay alive ourselves.” 

The timing was perfect. Too per- 
fect, Phillips found time to think as 
the alarm went off* with a clamor of 
bells and a blinking of overhead 
lights. 

Danton stiffened, and Phillips 
stared with startled eyes at the too- 
thin walls. By the time he had 
released his breath, instinctively 
caught in his lungs, and assured 

JAMES E. GUNN 




himself that the walls separating 
him from vacuum and death were 
still imperforate, Danton was at the 
wall phone. 

“Where is it?” he snapped. 
“Okay, ril be there in two seconds. 
Get the air pressure up, and release 
the marker.” 

Danton had the door open and 
was through it before Phillips 
moved. The next few minutes for 
Phillips were a kaleidoscope of con- 
fusion that somehow achieved swift 
results. 

The automatic doors of the air- 
testing lab were closed. The walls 
within had been pierced by a mete- 
or which had burst through the 
bumper that stopped 99 percent of 
those hitting the Wheel. Emergency 
air blowers were building up air 
pressure inside the room to give the 
men within time to adjust emer- 
gency oxygen helmets, locate the 
holes by means of the harmless col- 
ored gas that had been released 
into the section, and plug them. 

But something had gone wrong. 

“What’s the delay?” Danton de- 
manded. 

From a cluster of men perform- 
ing incomprehensible jobs outside 
the airtight door, a sweaty face 
turned. Phillips recognized Lieuten- 
ant Chapman, the air-control of- 
ficer. 

“I don’t know. They should be 
out by now. I can’t raise anybody. 
Fred’s in there and young Grant. 
All I can pick up is a low moaning 
noise. Somebody’s alive. I’ve got 
two men outside trying to plug the 
leaks from there. Until then wc 
can’t open the door. Hold on!” 

He turned to the crewman beside 

powder keg 



him who had a self-powered 'hand- 
set to his ear. “Air pressure is climb- 
ing. Yes, here comes the report 
now. The leak is plugged. It’ll be a 
couple of minutes.” 

“Leak?” Danton said softly. 
Chapman looked at him and 
said, “Yes, sir. One.” 

The minutes passed leadenly. 
“Okay,” Chapman said. “Open it 
up.” 

The door came open. Red fog 
drifted through. Phillips sniffed at 
it gingerly, but it was odorless. 
Within seconds two men were 
brought into the room, one bare- 
headed and limp in the arms of a 
rescuer who carried his one-third 
normal Earth weight without effort, 
the other helmeted and stumbling. 

Danton said impatiently, “Well, 
what are you waiting for?” 

Phillips looked up. Danton was 
frowning at him. “You’re an M.D. 
Take care of that man.” He 
pointed to the unconscious man 
who had been laid gently on the 
floor. 

“The other one’s in shock,” Phil- 
lips objected. “He needs help, too.” 
Danton said grimly, “He’ll live. 
Not that I care much. But Fred is 
important.” When Phillips still hesi- 
tated, Danton shoved him roughly 
toward the man on the floor. “Get 
busy, damn it!” 

Phillips started his examination. 
Danton, the emotion gone from his 
voice, said, “You don’t understand, 
do you, Phillips? When that meteor 
hit and the air began whooshing 
out. Grant forgot everything he 
ever learned. He froze. Fred wasted 
precious seconds getting a helmet 
onto him. By that time it was too 

25 




late to get into his own.” 

Phillips glanced up. Grant’s hel- 
met had been stripped from his 
head. His young face was no longer 
animated and open. His nose had 
bled down over his upper lip and 
chin. His eyes were wide and unsee- 
ing; his lips moved but no sound 
came out. 

Suddenly Phillips was angry. The 
only normal man on the Wheel, and 
Phillips couldn’t help him. “He was 
in shock,” he snapped. 

“Spacemen don’t go into shock. 
We can’t afford to. All our lives de- 
pend upon the ability of each one 
of us to be able to act swiftly and 
correctly in an emergency when 
other men might go into shock. If 
men can’t do it — every time — they 
don’t belong out here.” 

Phillips got up slowly. 

“What are you doing?” Danton 
demanded roughly. 

“He’s dead,” Phillips said. 

Before Phillips could move, Dan- 
ton’s hand slapped viciously against 
Grant’s cheek. The boy’s head 
jerked, but his eyes remained blank 
as the cheek slowly reddened. 

Danton screamed, “You dirty 
spy!” 

When Phillips started toward 
Grant, Danton swung around to 
glare at him with mad eyes. Phillips 
stopped. In a moment Danton’s 
breathing had slowed. He said, al- 
most calmly, to Chapman, “Take 
him to first aid. When he comes 
around, tell him to get his personal 
belongings together. He’s through.” 

“He needs immediate attention,” 
Phillips said, his teeth clenched. 
“Serum and — ” 



“He’ll get them. Come with me.” 
Reluctantly Phillips followed 
Danton’s square back to weight 
control and down the spoke of the 
Wheel to Phillips’ cabin. Danton 
shoved open the door as if it were 
his own. He went in and put his 
back against the covered viewport. 

When Phillips had followed and 
closed the door, Danton said cas- 
ually, “You think I was hard on 
the kid.” 

Phillips ran his hand behind him 
under the table and turned on the 
recorder. “You make hard rules.” 
“This is a hard place; we have to 
be hard to stay out here. I’m not 
blaming the kid for being foolish. I 
was a young, foolish kid, too, and I 
almost got sent in for it. The rea- 
son he’s going in is that he didn’t 
do the right thing instinctively: he 
held his breath instead of releasing 
it — you saw his nosebleed. The ex- 
pansion of gases in his lungs did 
that ; it could as easily have been his 
lungs that hemorrhaged. I’m blam- 
ing him for not getting into his 
emergency helmet. I’m blaming 
him for killing a man, a good man, 
a man we couldn’t afford to lose.” 
“You shouldn’t have hit him.” 
“Did I hit him?” Danton said, 
surprised. He must have read the 
answer in Phillips’ face. “I’m sorry 
I did that.” 

“And calling him a spy?” 

“That, too, eh? I shouldn’t have 
done that, either.” Danton grinned 
but there was no mirth in it. “I 
don’t know why I’m arguing with 
you about sending a boy in. You’re 
the one who wants to send us all 
in.” 

“Not me. General Ashley.” 

JAMES E. GUNN 



26 




“Oh, yes. General Ashley. We’re 
going to have a time with him.” 
Danton took a pace forward and 
absently picked up the blob of clay 
from the table. “We’ve read your 
papers up here with a lot of in- 
terest.” 

“You get the psychological jour- 
nals?” 

“Microfilms of things that inter- 
est us. A lot of us would like to 
know why we had to come out. But 
you haven’t found the answer with 
your inquiries into broken homes 
and insecurity and neuroses.” 
“What makes you so certain?” 
“Too easy. Men aren’t that sim- 
ple. It’s like Neanderthal noticing a 
rainbow every time it rains and de- 
ciding that the rain makes the rain- 
bow. The rain is part of it, but the 
sun is more important. It provides 
the energy. You can’t reduce all the 
impulses to be different — the ad- 
venturousness, the criminality, the 
greatness — into cause and effect. 
After all the causes are fractionated 
off, you will still have an indefin- 
able something that makes Man a 
man — a questioning, seeking ani- 
mal.” 

“You can’t argue away the fact 
that you are children playing ex- 
plorer, too immature to tackle the 
everyday problems of life inside.” 
Danton didn’t take the bait. He 
grinned. This time he almost meant 
it. “Is that how we look to you? 
Well, maybe we are. But it would 
be a sad commentary on the hu- 
man race if all its progress had to 
be traced to the children of the 
race who ran away and found some- 
thing new and wonderful beyond 
the hill. 



“Did you ever ask yourself, 
Lloyd, why General Ashley picked 
you to do his field work — a capable 
officer we will quickly agree, but 
certainly a minor Air Force cap- 
tain.” 

“I’m a young man. My adjust- 
ment rating is good.” 

“Could it be,” Danton asked 
gently, “that he was sure, before- 
hand, what kind of a report you 
would bring back, that he knew 
your reputation and your convic- 
tions — ?” 

Danton let the question die in 
Phillips’ silence. Finally Phillips 
shrugged and said, “It doesn’t mat- 
ter. I’m going back on the next 
shuttle. I’ve got everything I need. 
And I’m going back with the same 
report any competent psychologist 
would make.” He looked defiantly 
at Danton. 

Danton chuckled. “Don’t worry. 
We won’t stop you. We could, but 
we won’t. Sackcloth would just 
send up somebody else, and he 
might not be as easy to get along 
with. What are you going to tell 
Ashley?” 

Phillips studied Danton for a mo- 
ment. The question of paranoia was 
settled. What he had to decide was 
whether he had enough evidence or 
whether he could take the risk of 
pushing Danton to the cracking 
point. He took the risk. “The Big 
Wheel has taken over all your non- 
military functions: weather ob- 

servation, scientific research, radio 
relay — ” 

“And is making money at it.” 

“If the Little Wheel has no other 
function than observation and mis- 
sile guidance,” Phillips continued 



POWDER KEG 



27 




steadily, “it has no reason for being. 
It can’t do these things satisfactori- 
ly, and the very existence of the 
functions is a constant temptation 
to fulfill them. I can’t guarantee the 
soundness of the men out here.” 
“Whose soundness can you guar- 
antee?” Dan ton asked, letting his 
weariness show through. “You’ve 
seen General Ashley, and you’ve 
seen me. Whose finger would you 
rather have on the firing button?” 
“The people chose General Ash- 
ley.” 

Danton’s eyelid jerked. “What 
people? The only person who chose 
General Ashley was General Ash- 
ley.” 

Phillips insisted stubbornly, “He 
was chosen through the proper 
functioning of a democratic gov- 
ernment. Nobody can be permitted 
to substitute his personal prefer- 
ences or his own decisions.” 

“Even when ‘the people’s choice’ 
is obviously a megalomaniac af- 
flicted with agoraphobia?” Danton 
hesitated; when he spoke again his 
voice was apologetic. “That was un- 
fair. I brought it up only to prove 
that you would trust General Ash- 
ley out here — even if he could en- 
dure it — even less than you trust 
me. Ashley sent you out with a ques- 
tion that had only one answer: no 
one can be trusted.” 

“Well? Isn’t that a good reason 
for bringing you in?” 

“If that were our only purpose 
out here, and we really could serve 
that purpose as everyone believes — 
yes, certainly. But it wouldn’t do 
any good, because there’s ten times 
the firepK)wer stored Inside, waiting 
for a nervous finger to unleash it.” 

28 



Danton looked straight into Phil- 
lips’ face, his eyelid twitching. “You 
know the real reason Ashley doesn’t 
want us up here. He’s not afraid 
that we’ll shoot without orders. He’s 
afraid that he’ll tell us to fire and 
we won’t obey.” 

How much of Danton^ s argument 
was truth, how much casuistry? 
Phillips wondered. And then he re- 
membered “What if he refused to 
come?” and thought: Yes, Ashley 
was worried about that. 

That put a new and revealing 
light on Ashley, but it didn’t change 
the basic premises of the situation: 
there were still men up here who 
could destroy the world if they 
weren’t more than men can be ex- 
pected to be. 

The knock at the door was like 
punctuation for his thoughts. When 
Danton opened it. Chapman was 
there, tossing a slim length of tub- 
ing in his hand. 

“Got it, eh?” Danton said, with- 
out surprise. 

“Still reeks of gunpowder.” 

“No one tried to sneak it away?” 

Chapman shook his head. “Can’t 
figure it.” 

Phillips looked from the tube to 
Chapman to Danton. “What are 
you trying to say? That the lab wall 
was pierced by a bullet instead of a 
meteor?” 

Danton shrugged impatiently. 
“Of course. A meteor that size 
would have gone clear through. 
Two holes. The missile had to come 
from inside. And where does that 
knock your theories, Mr. Freud?” 

Phillips didn’t pause to think. “It 
supports my belief that the men up 

JAMES E. GUNN 




here are unstable — unstable enough 
to attempt murder — or suicide.’' 

Dan ton said mildly, “You think 
a spaceman did that? Unh-unh. 
We have too great and natural a 
respect for meteors to create arti- 
ficial ones. Besides, where would an 
unstable spaceman get a bullet? No. 
This was sabotage.” 

“Whose?” 

“You figure it out. We’ve fought 
it before — for almost six months, as 
a matter of fact.” Danton looked at 
Phillips suddenly with hard, frozen 
eyes. “As a matter of fact. Captain, 
you were the last one out.” 

There was a moment of awk- 
ward silence as Phillips leaned for- 
ward, incredulous, and Danton’s 
suspicions filled the room. The flat, 
tinny voice of the wall speaker was 
loud: “All hands to emergency sta- 
tions. The taxis are loose. Drifting. 
All hands — ” 

Danton’s expression changed in- 
stantly. “Maybe I’m wrong.” A wry 
smile twisted his lips. “Here, Cap- 
tain, here’s your Rorschach blob.” 
He put the clay gently on the table 
and was gone. 

Phillips stared at the door 
through which Danton had van- 
ished. Did Danton seriously suspect 
him? Or was it only his paranoia 
peeping through? There were no 
grounds — 

But there were. The tub smelling 
of freshly exploded gunpowder. If 
it did smell of gunpowder, and if it 
was found in the air-testing lab, 
and if it had not been planted there 
by Danton himself. 

The thought had occurred to 
him when it happened that the tim- 
ing was perfect. But that would im- 

POWDER KEG 



ply an acting ability far beyond the 
self-limitations of paranoia. If Dan- 
ton had planted the tube, he was 
not paranoid. If he had not, then 
someone was trying to sabotage the 
Wheel. 

Phillips realized, as he should 
have realized before, that the whole 
case against the Wheel rested or fell 
on the sanity of the commanding 
officer. He looked down at the table 
and froze. 

The clay that Danton had put 
there was no longer a blob. It was 
a figure, the figure of a child stand- 
ing sturdily on his feet, looking up. 
Deftly, as he had talked, Danton’s 
fingers had worked, shaping, cre- 
ating — a work of art. As such it 
should be judged, not in psycholog- 
ical terms. With a few skillful 
touches Danton had created what 
he had been describing — the child 
who ran away and found some- 
thing new and wonderful beyond 
the hill. But there was more than 
that — there was the concept of 
greatness here and the questing . 

But Phillips had to judge it on 
his own terms, and there was where 
his distress was greatest. Because in 
this figure was understanding and 
compassion and belief in mankind 
— and not a trace of paranoia. 

That meant — it could only mean 
— that Danton was surrounded by 
spies. He had a right to be suspi- 
cious. His neurosis was functional. 

The difficulty was — Danton knew 
too much. What was it he had said 
as he left? Here, Captain, here's 
your Rorschach blob. 

But that would imply that Dan- 
ton knew himself so well, and his 
psychology so well, and was so con- 



29 




summate an artist, that he could 
create — this! 

It was too much. Phillips’ head 
whirled. Nausea churned his stom- 
ach like a touch of spacesickness. 

Deliberately he picked up the fig- 
ure and squeezed it back into 
shapelessness. 

Only moments later did he recall 
why Danton had hurried away. The 
taxis were loose. Drifting. And if 
the taxis were gone, he was ma- 
rooned. 

Phillips threw himself through 
the doorway. 

HILLIPS SCRAMBLED down 
the spoke to the Hub. It was 
empty. C3nly two spacesuits were 
hanging from their supports. He 
struggled into one that was too 
large. He squeezed through an air- 
lock and then, carefully snapping 
the hook of his safety line to a ring 
just beyond the cagelike entrance, 
slipped outside. 

He floated slowly out from the 
Hub, spinning in the black im- 
mensity of night, the pinpoint holes 
of the stars making streaks past his 
eyes like a poor astronomical plate. 
VVith a short tug on his line, work- 
ing with an instinct he had never 
known he had, Phillips slowed his 
spin. 

He saw one — a plump sausage 
with a plastic window — floating 
gently away from the gleaming rim 
of the wheel. Gently — and yet the 
taxi diminished with alarming 
swiftness. Then he saw another and 
another. All drifting away. As far 
as he could see, there were none 
left tied to the wheel. 

30 



There should have been chaos 
here, with suited men pouring out 
of the Wheel without plan or prece- 
dent for an emergency whose scope 
Phillips could only guess. But there 
was a crazy kind of order in the 
silence. 

Men were snapping their safety 
lines to each other’s suits instead of 
the Wheel. One man, in the lead, 
was clambering with incredible 
speed along the spoke until he 
reached the rim. Then he jumped, 
his bent legs tlirusting him away 
from the satellite spinning beneath, 
his safety line trailing behind. As 
that line almost reached its limit, 
the man to whom it was attached 
jumped after him. 

One after another they jumped, 
forming a living chain of space- 
suited men linked together by al- 
most invisible strands of cord, 
working together as a unit with the 
social instinct of army ants, reach- 
ing toward the stars, throwing a 
thin bridge across the impassable 
river of space. 

FlamCi spurted from the suit at 
the head of the chain. It curved 
slowly toward the nearest taxi. 

For Phillips it had all the potency 
of a major symbol. Men would die, 
but others would take their place, 
and one day men would cross over 
the bridge their comrades’ courage 
and sacrifice had made, and reach 
the stars. 

The taxi was still receding swift- 
ly — swifter, it seemed to Phillips, 
than the chain that reached toward 
it. Would the chain be long 
enough? 

He caught a ring on the spoke of 
the Wheel and swung himself out 

JAMES E. GUNN 





toward the rim. Suddenly he was 
stopped. Something had caught 
him from behind. He swung his 
head around inside the helmet to 
look back. 1 here was a spacesuited 
man behind him, the hook in his 
sleeve-ending caught somewhere in 
Phillips’ suit beneath his range of 
vision. With the hook in his other 
sleeve, the man held himself to a 
ring on the Hub. Easily he pulled 
Phillips back toward him. 

Phillips could not see who it was. 
The helmet viewplates were dark 
to keep out ultraviolet. Then he 
recognized a faded eagle on the 
chest of the suit. 

His helmet bumped gently 
against the other helmet. Transmit- 
ted through that contact came the 
metallic voice, “Where do you think 
you’re going?” It was Danton. 

“It may not be long enough.” 

Danton did not have to ask what 
he meant. “If it isn’t, you can’t 
help. That takes teamwork. Some- 
thing you have to learn. Something 
you have to live. When everybody’s 
life depends on the actions of every- 
one else, that comes easily.” 

The implication was clear: he 
wasn’t a part of the team, not even 
a player on anyone’s team. “But it’s 
serious — ” 

“Of course it is. If they don’t 
reach that taxi, we’re stuck. We 
can’t get supplies over from the 
shuttles. We can’t finish our — 
work.” 

“Until they send out replace- 
ments?” 

Even through the helmets. Dan- 
ton’s voice was ironic. “And that’s 
something Ashley can veto.” 

“You think this is Ashley’s — ?” 



“That’s for you to decide.” 

“We’d better help,” Phillips said, 
trying to struggle free. 

“How much help would you be?” 
Danton asked. He let Phillips swing 
away a little to see his safety line 
still clipped to a ring on the Hub. 
Then he pulled him back. “You’d 
just get in their way. They’ll get it.” 

The two of them, clasped to- 
gether like misshapen and amorous 
starfish, had floated around until 
the lengthening chain had drifted 
back into view. The first suit, its 
rocket jets blazing in brief spurts, 
was farther ahead of the second 
link than it should have been. It 
had cut its safety line, Phillips real- 
ized. It was heading out, alone, into 
the black, bottomless river. 

But it was catching up. It reached 
out a stubby arm toward the taxi. 
And missed! No, it had caught a 
hold. The suit and the taxi drew to- 
gether, became one . 

For the first time Phillips won- 
dered: Who had cut the taxis loose? 
And why? And what had he been 
doing while everyone was outside. 

Suddenly he knew the answer to 
all of them. 

He turned, but Danton was gone. 
He had gone, Phillips realized, even 
before the taxi had been caught. 

Would Ashley go this far? Phillips 
asked himself. And he had to an- 
swer, Yes. How much farther would 
he go to destroy the Little Wheel? 
The answer to that was: as far as 
he had to go. 

Phillips was swinging into the 
Hub. As he slipped through the 
cage, he saw the captured taxi 
blasting toward another sausage-

shape against the black-velvet cur- 
tain of night. Around the edge of 
the Wheel, like a giant moon, came 
that enigmatic circle of mirrorlike 
metal. Descending on the other side 
of the Wheel was that flimsy, im- 
possible contraption of rocket mo- 
tors and spherical tanks. 

By the time Phillips had ex- 
tracted himself from his suit. Dan- 
ton had disappeared. Phillips fol- 
lowed, calling, “Danton! Amos!” 

The words echoed in the empty 
Wheel. There was no answer. The 
weight-control room was deserted. 
So was the first-aid room, the pump 
room, and air control. Phillips went 
back through weight control and 
into celestial observation. Danton 
was sitting in a chair staring calmly 
at the closed air-tight door that 
separated him from Earth-observa- 
tion. 

“You’d better come out. Grant,” 
Danton said gently. “You’ll get 
hurt in there.” He was talking into 
a wall speaker. 

From the speaker came a burst of 
hysterical laughter. “You’re the 
ones who’ll get hurt. Colonel, you 
and those stupid animals Inside.” It 
was Grant’s voice, Phillips recog- 
nized. “The missiles are set and 
armed. Colonel, and I’ve got my 
finger on the firing button. Try to 
get me out and blooey! there goes 
the world! And blooey! there goes 
the Wheel!” 

“Grant?” Although Phillips had 
known it logically, he still found it 
hard to believe. “But he was in 
shock!” 

With Phillips’ first word, Danton 
had slapped off the speaker. “So we 
thought,” he said, turning slowly 

32 



toward the psychologist. “Evidently 
we were wrong. The cutting away 
of the taxis was a diversion. If it 
succeeded, fine. If not, it still gave 
Grant time to take over Earth-ob- 
servation.” 

“What’s he going to do?” 

Danton shrugged. “You heard 
him.” 

“He’s insane!” 

“You’re the authority on that.” 
“Can’t we sneak in on him an- 
other way?” 

“Before he can hit that button? 
Not a chance, even if he didn’t 
have the other door locked, And 
even a madman would do that.” 
“Haven’t you got gas? Can’t you 
knock him out?” 

“Before he realizes what’s hap- 
pening?” Danton shook his head 
impatiently. “We can’t stock items 
up here unless we have a probable 
use for them.” 

Phillips sought desperately for a 
straw. “Someone cracked! It was 
what Ashley was afraid of!” 

“Was it?” Danton asked, smiling 
gently. His eyes drifted back across 
the wide, flat photographic projec- 
tion screen where Mars still glowed 
redly, to the sealed door. 

“Keep talking, Danton,” Phillips 
said quickly. “In his condition, if 
he’s alone too long he’ll work up his 
courage to press the button.” 
“You’re the psychologist. You 
talk him out.” 

“Me?” Involuntarily Phillips 
took half a step backward. “Who’s 
your missile-control officer? He 
should know how to cut the firing 
circuit, disarm the missiles . .” 
“We had one once, but he got 
transferred five years ago. We never 

JAMES E. GUNN 




replaced him.” 

“He’s in your T/O — ” 

“We’ve got no use for a missile- 
control officer. Look!” Danton 
swung around in the chair. It 
squealed a complaint. He punched 
a button beside the viewport. The 
outside cover swung away, letting 
in the night. “See that?” 

The great circle of shiny metal 
slid past the window. “That’s an 
anti-missile screen,” Danton said 
somberly, “and it’s worthless. It’s 
set squarely ahead of us in our orbit, 
sweeping space. But the first thing 
an aggressor would do would be to 
send up a missile without a warhead 
of weak gunpowder and fine lead 
particles. When it reached our orbit 
— going in the opposite direction — 
it would explode and leave in our 
path a cloud of eight billion tiny 
missiles. Every hour we would run 
into that cloud. The first time the 
anti-missile screen would intercept 
them, maybe even the second, but 
then it would look like a cheese 
grater. After that, we would be the 
cheese grater.” 

“You could strike back — ” 
“How? Even if we spotted the 
missile taking off and knew where it 
came from, it would take us hours 
to get a missile into the atmosphere 
without burning up. No, Lloyd, in 
a new war, we’d be the first casual- 
ties. This is a powder keg, all right, 
and we’re sitting on it. We know it. 
We live with it every minute of 
every waking hour. But the fuse is 
down below, and the only way you 
can save this powder keg is to go in 
and stamp on it. Or make sure it is 
never lit.” 

“Then there’s no reason at all for 



the existence of the Little Wheel! 
The Big Wheel has taken over all 
your other functions: weather ob- 
servation, television relay, research 
. All that’s left is military ob- 
servation and missile guidance. You 
ignore the first and can’t fulfill the 
second. Your presence here is a 
constant temptation to resolve your 
problems by destroying their 
source.” 

“And thereby destroy ourselves. 
We aren’t that stupid. We can’t ex- 
ist independently of Earth — not 
yet.” 

“Decisions aren’t always logical. 
Not even usually. Grant is your best 
example. Give me that speaker!” 
Danton said softly, “I think may- 
be he has his reasons.” He hit the 
speaker switch. “But go ahead.” 
Phillips said urgently, “Grant! 
This is Dr. Phillips.” 

“What do you want, head- 
shrinker?” 

“Listen to me. Grant. Don’t press 
that button! You don’t have to. I’ll 
guarantee that the Wheel is de- 
stroyed.” 



P DR A LONG moment there was 
silence in the little room where 
the red image of Mars glowed from 
the screen. Phillips was suddenly 
aware of the Little Wheel’s odor, a 
compound of oil and human sweat, 
like a machine shop inside the steam 
room at the local YMCA. On top 
of it all was the acrid odor of fear. 
Phillips could feel drops of sweat 
collecting on his forehead and 
trickling into his eyebrows. 

Danton was loolang at him. Phil- 
lips turned his head to meet Dan- 



POWDER KEG 



33 




ton’s half-tolerant contempt with 
cold eyes. 

Grant’s breathing came harshly 
through the speaker. “Don’t make 
me laugh, headshrinker. Nobody’s 
gonna trick me. When I get ready, 
I’m gonna push this button. No- 
body can stop me.” 

Phillips spoke coldly, swiftly, 
“Listen to me! General Ashley sent 
me up here to make a report to 
him, and the report I’m going to 
make. Grant, will blast the Wheel 
right out of the sky. If you push 
that button, the world will die. 
Grant, and you’ll die, too. You 
don’t want that. You don’t have to 
die. Grant. The Wheel is finished.” 
“Even if you were telling the 
truth, you couldn’t do it, Phillips. 
Danton would stop you somehow. 
He’s too tricky. He’d find a way 
out. But he can’t stop me from 
pushing this button!” 

Phillips pleaded, “For God’s 
sake. Grant — ” 

“No use, headshrinker. I think 
you’re lying. Because Ashley sent 
me up to do this job, and I’m gonna 
do it. Tf you can’t do it any other 
way,’ he said, ‘send down a missile. 
That’ll be the end of the Wheel.’ 
I’m really gonna do him a job.” 
Grant laughed insanely. “I’m gon- 
na send ’em all down.” 

Phillips whispered, “He’s too far 
gone.” 

Danton leaned toward the 
speaker. “It’s no use pushing the 
button,” he said quietly. “There 
aren’t any missiles.” He switched 
off the speaker and leaned back in 
his chair. 

Phillips said quickly, “That won’t 
do any good. He’ll push it just to 

34 



make sure.” 

“To men who have made up 
their minds the truth is never any 
good.” 

“What do you mean — the 

truth?” 

“There aren’t any missiles. Earth 
is in no danger from us. Too bad 
we can’t tell them that. But we 
can’t. And therefore we must live 
in constant expectation of a mo- 
ment of madness Inside that will 
send up a missile to destroy a threat 
that doesn’t exist.” 

“No missiles?” Phillips shook his 
head incredulously. Droplets of 
sweat flew from his face. “What 
happened to them? You had 
them!” 

“Oh, we had them. But, as Ash- 
ley feared, their existence was a 
constant temptation. So we used 
them for a better purpose.” 

“What are you talking about? 
What better purpose?” 

“In a moment.” Danton looked 
through the viewport at the stars 
wheeling past, steady, many-col- 
ored, and available. “You talk of 
powder kegs. I’ll tell you something 
about powder. It’s only dangerous 
when it’s imprisoned. Spread it out 
in the open air, set it off, and it 
makes a fizzling sound and a bright 
light. Look, there’s Earth!” It ro- 
tated beyond the window, brilliant 
in reflected sunshine, an incredible 
jewel set against the velvet of the 
night. “That’s your powder ^eg, 
masses of humanity penned up in 
unyielding containers, more people 
every minute. If you don’t give 
them some outlet, an explosion is 
inevitable. Anything might set it 
off: an unguarded fire, an acci- 

JAMES E. GUNN 




dental spark, spontaneous combus- 
tion . 

“And you’re the outlet?” 

“S)TTibolically. Oh, there’s no 
practical way of relieving popula- 
tion pressures except by birth con- 
trol. We can’t export our excess mil- 
lions to the planets or the stars. But 
we can give them a vent for their 
excess energies, for their frustrated 
aggressions, for their unused 
dreams. The existence of a frontier 
is enough ; everyone doesn’t have to 
go there.” 

Danton paused, his eyes fixed on 
the viewport, for a moment the tic 
in his eyelid stilled. “Look there! 
Now!” The ungainly contraption 
of rocket motors and spherical tanks 
floated past. “There’s our outlet. 
There’s where the missiles have 
gone: their motors are units for 
that ship, their warheads have been 
converted into atomic powerplants. 
They were designed with that pur- 
pose in mind.” 

Phillips said slowly, “That just 
about co\ers every ofl'ensc in the 
code: disobedience, insubordina- 

tion, dereliction of duty, misap- 
propriation of material, mutiny . .” 

Danton dismissed them with a 
wave of his hand. “Words. They 
aren’t important. Survival is impor- 
tant. And that ship is the key to sur- 
vival.” 

“Where are you going in that 
thing?” 

Danton looked past Phillips to- 
ward the photographic enlargement 
on the projection screen. “Mars.” 

Phillips studied the hard, black- 
ened face. Madman or prophet? 
Traitor or something greater than 
patriot? He had to decide, and 

POWDER KEG 



soon. He looked back at the view- 
port, but the flimsy structure was 
gone. “In that?” 

“The Vikings crossed the Atlan- 
tic in their tiny dragon ships.” 
“How are you going to get away 
with it?” 

“We were going to wait until we 
could announce a successful trip, 
but it’s too late for that. Ashley is 
getting desperate ; next time he 
might not fail. We might not be 
here when the ship returned. In- 
stead we’ll release the news that 
the ship will start soon.” Danton 
grinned unexpectedly. “Then let 
Ashley deny it if he dares.” 

“He’ll never rest until he drags 
down the Wheel.” 

“Let him try that, too, when the 
world knows what we’re going to 
do. I'hat’s our hole card, the 
aroused dreams of the world’s bil- 
lions. Go on back, Lloyd. Tell them 
we’re all neurotic, all crackpots, and 
we’ll tell them they’re in no danger 
from us. We’ve beaten our swords 
into dreams. We'll show them the 
Wheel, and we’ll show them the 
Mars ship, and we’ll invite them, 
vicariously, on the first trip to an- 
other world. They’ll come. They 
can’t refuse. They’re men like us; 
they’re dreamers.” 

“Out here isn’t far enough,” Phil- 
lips said softly. “You’re running 
farther away.” 

“Gall it ‘running’ if you like. An- 
other man may call it conquest or 
adventure. Words. What makes a 
man run doesn’t matter; it’s where 
he runs and what he does when he 
gets there and what his running 
means. What makes you run, 
Lloyd?” 



35 




“What do you mean?” Phillips 
stiffened. 

“You’ve been analyzed. What 
drove you to be a psychologist? 
What made you enlist in the Air 
Force? What forced you to investi- 
gate the submerged motives of 
spacemen? What was it: a broken 
home, an overprotective mother, a 
disinterested father? What complex 
was it? Give it a name!” 

Panic raced through Phillips’ 
veins. He can^t know. He’s guess- 
ing—^ 

“Give it a name,” Danton con- 
tinued without pausing, “and I 
won’t give a damn. What matters 
to me is that you’re good spaceman 
material gone to waste. You’re one 
of the rare ones, one of those first 
air breathers, and you won’t climb 
out upon the land because there’s 
something left out of you. That’s a 
pity. We need men like you. You 
could help us put it over — this little 
thing with Ashley and the big vic- 
tory over Mars and the fantastic 
distance that lies between.” 

“We could use your knowledge 
of psychology to help pick the men 
who could make the trip and stay 
sane and come back to report their 
success to us and the world. You 
could help us phrase our releases to 
the imaginations of men, releases 
that will open their hearts and 
shape their dreams. You wouldn’t 
have to go back; I could declare 
you essential and keep you here un- 
til Sackcloth or I died of old age.” 
“Help you do what? Defraud 
the people as you have defrauded 
their government and their de- 
fenses?” 

“The exploration of the unknown 



is always a fraud,” Danton said, his 
eyes distant, remembering. “Be- 
cause we can’t know, by definition, 
what we are going to find, we can’t 
have the right reasons for finding 
it or even for going where we can 
find it. And the reasons we give our- 
selves will always be the wrong rea- 
sons, because the only real reason 
is that there’s something unknown 
to be discovered. 

“Fraud,” Danton repeated, his 
eyelid jerking again. “I’ll tell you 
about fraud. When I came out my 
eyes were filled with visions and my 
head was swimming with dreams. 
And I found out that the visions 
were false, and the dreams were the 
wrong ones. 

“That was when I ran. I ran to 
the S.1.1. You know what it is — 
the ship in the same orbit as the 
Little Wheel, one hundred miles 
ahead, in which Rev. McMillen 
first conquered space, in which he 
died because he couldn’t get back. 

“Do you know what I found? A 
hollow shell. No one was ever in- 
side. It wasn’t built for a passenger. 
They couldn’t build one to carry a 
man — not with the funds they had 
— and Bo Finch and Pickrell and a 
few others perpetrated a fraud on 
the people so that space could be 
conquered. And it was conquered 
— for the wrong reasons and in the 
wrong way. 

“The visions were wrong. Men 
never find what they are seeking. 
That’s what keeps them seeking. 
Men will never find out here what 
they’re looking for — not peace or 
wealth or the thrill of final con- 
quest. 

“I learned then, as every man 
JAMES E. GUNN 



36 




must learn if he is to become a man, 
that he must be stronger than his 
dreams, that he must be able to 
watch them shatter and go on. Call 
it childish. Call it what you will.” 

Danton’s voice dropped wearily. 
Now he looked like an old man in- 
stead of a man this side of forty 
with prematurely white hair. “The 
fact remains that it is the soul of 
man and his salvation. He is a 
dream-maker, and the latest dream 
is the best, no matter how many 
have been shattered before. 

“Go Inside, Captain Phillips. Go 
Inside if you wish and tell them 
what I have told you, all of it. And 
I will lie and call you a liar, and 
the lies won’t matter, just as the 
shattered dreams don’t matter. 

“The people will believe me, be- 
cause I am a dreamer, and they 
understand dreams. This is the lat- 
est dream in the oldest dream of all 
— the conquest of man’s environ- 
ment, the universe. 

“And that dream is invincible.” 



HE DOOR to Earth-observa- 
tion opened. Grant stumbled 
through the doorway. His face was 
blank. His eyes stared, but they saw 
nothing. 

“I pushed it,” he said tonelessly. 
“I pushed it and nothing hap- 
pened.” 

Danton had stood up as the door 
opened. Grant walked right into 
him. At the contact he collapsed. 
He hid his face against Danton’s 
chest. A sob broke from his throat. 

Danton patted the boy’s shoul- 
der. “That’s all right. It’s all right. 
The truth is hard to find, and when 



you find it, it always hurts. I know. 
I found it.” 

He looked at Phillips. “You see,” 
he said gently, “it isn’t the neurotic 
men out here you have to be afraid 
of, not the men who had to come 
out. The dangerous ones are the 
men who come out for something 
else, for money or for glory.” 

Phillips looked at Danton for a 
moment and then turned his eyes 
away, turned them to the open 
viewport and the stars. They were 
too bright, but they were not as 
bright as Danton. 

Danton was right. 

Phillips could not decide when 
he had first known it. Perhaps it 
had been just a few minutes ago as 
he had pleaded with Grant, not a 
spaceman but a displanted Earth- 
man, to spare the Earth. Perhaps it 
had been earlier as he watched the 
spacemen building a bridge toward 
the stars and he had moved to help. 
Perhaps it had been when he had 
seen the compassion and under- 
standing in the Rorschach blob. 

But he thought it was much 
earlier, when he had realized that 
he himself was a spaceman, one of 
the air breathers who had crawled 
out upon the land and found the 
experience so satisfying that he 
could never go back to the mother 
sea. 

If a man is lucky he has one such 
time in his life when he knows him- 
self. But it meant that his entire 
concept of the human animal had 
to change. 

The basic quality of life is move- 
merit. An immobile animal is a dead 
animal. Carnivore and prey know

A QUESTION OF 

BY FRANK RILEY 





Illustrated by ViroU Finlay

'VERY PAIR OF eyes in the hushed courtroom 
watched Jake Emspak walk slowly toward the pro- 
spective juror. 

Around the Earth, and above it, too, from South 
Africa and Franz Joseph Land to the satellite stations 
adrift through the black morning, 
two hundred million pairs of eyes 
focussed on the gaunt figure that 

I ^\ C T I T Y moved so deliberately across the 

Lr I ^ I I I I television screen. 

In the glass-fronted TV booth, 
where the 80-year-old Edward R. 
Murrow had created something of a stir by his unex- 
pected appearance a few moments earlier, newsmen 
stopped talking to let the viewers see and hear for 




themselves what was happening. 

Jake halted in front of the wit- 
ness stand, both hands cupped over 
the gold head of the cane that had 
been his trademark, in and out of 
court, for most of a half century. 
The shaggy mane of white hair, 
once as black as the coal in the 
West Virginia mining country of 
his birth, stood out like an incon- 
gruous halo above the bone ridges 
of his face. The jutting nose, the 
forward hunch of his body accen- 
tuated the impression he always 
gave of being about to leap on a 
nervous witness. The magnificent 
voice, which could thunder, rasp, 
weep and persuade in all the regis- 
ters of eloquence, now phrased his 
first question with disconcerting 
softness: 

“What is a man?” 

The prospective juror, a Bronx 
appliance distributor with sagging 
jowls and perpetual tension lines 
around his mouth, started visibly. 
“I — I beg your pardon?” 

Again Jake Emspak gently 
phrased his question: 

“What is a man?” 

The distributor, who could wake 
up out of a sound sleep and ad- 
dins a sales meeting of unhappy 
dealers, opened his mouth and 
closed it again. Jake waited patient- 
ly, rocking a little on the point of 
his cane. 

Finally, the distributor said: 

“I can’t answer that — right 
off . ,” 

“Thank you,” Jake said mildly. 
He turned to Judge Hayward 
and nodded his acceptance of the 
juror. 

Up in the TV booth, Murrow 
40 



smiled to liimself and listened to his 
colleagues chew over the familiar 
questions: Why had Jake Emspak, 
the “million dollar mouthpiece”, 
taken a cheap case like this away 
from the Public Defender? Who 
would possibly pay him enough to 
defend a punk like Tony Cor&io — 
a bungling hoodlum who had killed 
two bystanders in a miserable at- 
tempt to rob a bank? 

TTie Judge noted acceptance of 
the juror, then brusquely recessed 
court until 10 a.m. Monday. 

The timing was excellent. Jake 
smiled with satisfaction, and his 
smile was like the slash of a paring 
knife across the skin of a dried ap- 
ple. 

He walked with Tony Corfino 
and the bailiff as far as the prison- 
er’s gate. 

“Don’t worry,” Jake said. 

Tony’s eyes were wide and be- 
wildered, like the eyes of a confused 
child — or of an old man not quite 
certain ' whether he is awake or 
dreaming. 

“I ain’t worried,” Tony replied. 
As he walked, there was the crack- 
ling sound of a bone twisting in a 
stiff joint. 

From under his shaggy brows, 
Jake studied him carefully, and was 
content with what he saw. Tony 
could have been very young, or very 
old. Undoubtedly he was both, with 
a lot of in-between, Jake thought 
suddenly. The tangle of black, curly 
hair was the hair of youth. The 
cameo-smooth skin had the waxed 
perfection of an expensive doll. But 
the mouth and lips were still puffy, 
sensuous. And the eyes — ^Jake Em- 
spak, for all his knowing, couldn’t 

FRANK RILEY 




be sure about the eyes. Silently, he 
addressed a memo to himself : 
Check on the eyes. 

At the prisoners’ gate, Tony faced 
him. 

“I ain’t worried,” he repeated. 
“It’s just — well, I don’t see why 
you’re takin’ my case — I can’t pay 
anythin’ ...” 

The thin smile slashed again 
across the wrinkled harshness of 
Jake’s face. 

“I’ll be paid,” he chuckled drily. 

The District Attorney brought up 
the same question when Jake sat 
in his office two hours later. They 
had been studying each other across 
the desk, thinking of all the years 
that were gone, the good years 
dying with the new quarter of the 
century. 

How many times had he sat here 
just like this, Jake wondered. How 
often had he come into this office to 
bargain and to deal, to cajole and 
plead — and always hovering like a 
hawk to pounce on any bit of in- 
formation that could fit his case. 

Now the D.A. was old, too. Old- 
er than Jake, if you measured a 
man’s life by the inverse propor- 
tion of his distance from the grave. 
Even the limitless possibilities of 
medical science had about reached 
their limit with the D.A. He was 
heavier than Jake, and his skin was 
smoother, yet somehow it looked 
much older. 

“I don’t get it,” he wheezed, with 
the shortness of breath that the lat- 
est bronchial replacement had not 
substantially relieved. “I just can’t 
see Jake Emspak taking a case with- 
out a fee! Why, in the old days, 
you wouldn’t defend your mother 

A QUESTION OF IDENTITY 



without a cashier’s check in ad- 
vance!” 

Jake accepted the taunt without 
blinking. 

“I’m touched by this solicitude 
for my fees,” he retorted. 

“Tony Corfino’s guilty,” said the 
D.A., moving up another pawn in 
the never-ending chess game be- 
tween them. “He’s a punk, and he’s 
guilty. You know that, don’t you, 
Jake?” 

“Do I?” 

“You know it — and damn well! 
I’ve got six witnesses who saw Tony 
walk into the bank with that sawed- 
off shotgun! I’ve got four more who 
saw him get panicky and start 
spraying lead! And there are a doz- 
en others who helped load him on 
a stretcher after his getaway car 
went over the curve on the Park- 
way! . Hell, Jake, this is a two- 
bit case^. Why are you taking it 
away from the Public Defender?” 

“Now, Emmett,” Jake mocked, 
“you know it’s not ethical for me to 
discuss my client’s case.” 

“To hell with your client!” The 
D.A. breathed deeply for a moment, 
then pressed ahead: “I don’t care 
about that punk — I’m talking about 
you, Jake. What’s this case mean 
to you?” 

The chuckle started again, then 
died in Jake’s throat. 

“It means a lot, Emmett,” he an- 
swered soberly. “For one thing, it’s 
mv last case . .” 

“What?” The D.A. looked 
stunned. 

Jake nodded. 

“I’ve been around the circle 
enough times for any man, Em- 
mett.” 



41 




Both of them absorbed this 
thought in silence, and the long 
years walked between them. The 
D.A.’s lips set, and the steel of his 
jaw showed beneath the soft folds 
of his skin. 

“I guess it’ll have to be my last 
case, too, Jake,” he said quietly. 
Then he banged his fist on the desk. 
“But what a helluva case! What a 
helluva two-bit case! We’ve had 
some good ones, Jake — I’ve got the 
scars of them all over me! But why 
do we have to go out on something 
as cheap as this?” 

Jake Emspak stood up, all six 
feet of him, and he brushed back 
his long white hair with a gesture 
that was fierce and strong. 

“It’s not a cheap case, Emmett! 
It’s big — bigger than any case we’ve 
ever fought out!” 

The reporters were waiting for 
Jake outside the D.A.’s office. 

“Is it true you’re retiring, Jake?” 
“This is my last case.” 

“Why are you representing Tony 
Corfino?” 

“You couldn’t keep me out of a 
case as big as this.” 

“Gan you tell us why it’s so big?” 
“I can, but I won’t. Not until I 
get before the jury.” 

“Is robbing a bank and shooting 
two people so important?” 

“Not particularly.” 

“What else did he do, then?” 
“Nothing that I know of.” 

“Jake, this isn’t some kind of a 
joke, is it?” 

“It’s the most serious case I’ve 
ever handled.” 

“Mr. Emspak, it was reported 
that you received $100,000 from 



your last client. Are you being paid 
for defending Tony Corfino?” 

“I never discuss my fees.” 
“Would you object to a televised 
interview with Tony?” 

“Certainly not. How about to- 
morrow morning?” 

The reporters left, baffled and in- 
trigued. That night, Jake Emspak 
sat alone in his apartment high 
over Central Park West, chuckling 
with satisfaction as he read the 
headlines in the first editions: 

FAMED CRIMINAL LAWYER 
IN MYSTERY CASE 

The other headlines were sub- 
stantially the same. Jake grinned. 
Things were working out fine, just 
fine. Publicity was a wonderful 
tool, if a lawyer knew when to use 
it, and how. He sliowed one of the 
headlines to his wife, whose picture 
was in a mellow gold frame on the 
stand beside his window chair. 
Marge had been dead since ’67, but 
he still found it a quiet comfort to 
share things with her. She didn’t 
have to answer, because words 
weren’t necessary after you’d lived 
and loved with a woman for forty- 
three years. His thin smile became 
warmer as he turned toward her. 

“Mystery case!” he chortled. 
“Mystery! The only mystery is why 
someone hasn’t tried a case like 
this before!” 

He paused, looked across the 
park at the spangle of lights, and 
added softly: 

“But I’m glad no one did.” 

Ed Murrow called just before 
Jake went to bed. 

“Sorry you got into this?” Mur- 
row asked. 



42 



FRANK RILEY 




“You know better than that, Ed. 
Fm deeply grateful to you for tip- 
ping me off on this case.” 

“Well, don’t forget to tip me off, 
too, Jake! I'm not too old to ap- 
preciate a scoop now and then!” 
“Don’t wor^, Ed . .” 

Next morning, Jake was rested 
and ready to meet the challenge of 
Tony Corfino’s TV interview. He 
knew there was a danger Tony 
might say too much, but it was a 
calculated risk that had to be taken. 
The case needed build-up, plenty 
of build-up. 

The interview took place in the 
open square between the towering 
cell-blocks of Manhattan’s new jail. 
When Jake and Tony came out, the 
TV cameramen and reporters had 
already taken their places. The 
city’s crack newspapermen were 
seated on folding chairs in front of 
the cameras, along with two men 
from the District Attorney’s office 
who self-consciously tried to look 
like members of the working press. 
Jake sat down beside Tony and 
hunched forward watchfully over 
the gold head of his cane. 

Bert Brown of the Tribune, 
whose pipelines into the D.A.’s of- 
fice had brought him many an ex- 
clusive, shot out the first question. 
It came with a whiplash crack: 
“Tony, are you paying Mr. Em- 
spak to represent you?” 

Tony looked uncertainly toward 
Jake, and when the old lawyer 
didn’t answer, Tony said quietly: 
“No— I’m not.” 

“Is the Syndicate paying Mr. 
Emspak?” 

“I don’t know why they should 
— I never got into the Syndicate.” 

A QUESTION OF IDENTITY 



Tony’s answer was expressionless, 
yet his voice had a strangely sub- 
dued quality for a Tenth Avenue 
kid who had grown up fighting for 
crumbs from the tables of under- 
world kingpins. 

Cassidy of the Times interjected: 

“Do you know who is paying Mr. 
Emspak to represent you?” 

“Nope.” 

Now the sun broke through the 
morning overcast and gleamed on 
the polished perfection of Tony’s 
waxlike skin. A woman reporter 
from the Mirror asked in an abrupt, 
mannish voice: 

“Tony — ^what happened to your 
face?” 

“The Doc says it’s some new 
kind of plastic surgery. I got burned 
in that accident . .”/ 

“When you were driving away 
from the bank?” Bert Brown 
snapped out. 

“Yeah.” 

Brown grinned in triumph. It 
had been a neat double play. The 
two investigators from the D.A.’s 
office scribbled furiously. Jake Em- 
spak continued to stare into the 
TV cameras without blinking. 

From the back row, a Daily News 
man boomed out: 

“Then you admit the shootings, 
Tony?” 

Jake lifted one finger from the 
gold head of his cane. It was a 
small gesture, but it silenced Tony’s 
answer and immediately command- 
ed the attention of everyone pres- 
ent. 

“My client,” rasped Jake, 
neither denies nor admits any con- 
nection with the crimes for which 
he is being tried.” 

43 




Bert Brown grinned sardonically 
at him. 

“Do you expect to win this case, 
Mr. Emspak?” 

“We’ll win it,” Jake answered, in 
a voice so cold and certain and 
hard that the reporters involuntar- 
ily joined the TV audience in a col- 
lective gasp. 

Jake stood up and motioned to 
the deputies. It was time to end the 
interview. Precisely the right time. 

The reporters left without further 
questions. They knew from long ex- 
perience when Jake Emspak would 
and would not talk. 

By that evening, speculation — 
without the ballast of facts — was 
soaring to dizzy heights. Even the 
communist angle came in for its 
share of limelight. Was Tony Cor- 
fino somehow of value to the re- 
surgent Red underground? Could 
Jake Emspak’s fee be traced back 
to Peiping, new headquarters for 
the Comintern? But not even the 
most skilled commentator could 
adequately sustain innuendo on in- 
nuendo alone. Not by the grossest 
distortion of facts could any Com- 
munist connection be twisted out of 
Tony’s record of juvenile delin- 
quency, pimping, pick-pocketing, 
petty thievery, dope peddling, 
armed robbery, and — since the 
grain and sugar restrictions of ’70 
— bootlegging. 

But one of the more perceptive 
reporters had noted Tony’s strange- 
ly quiet manner of speaking. In- 
quiries at the jail disclosed that 
Tony had apparently developed an 
interest in reading. 

Here, indeed, was a fresh angle! 
By mid-afternoon, “Gentleman 



Tony” had been conceived and 
given birth. His sordid record was 
reinterpreted in a picaresque light, 
and he became something of a 
Tenth Avenue Robin Hood. A na- 
tion squeezed between the twin 
problems of mounting population 
and tighter food rationing took 
“Gentleman Tony” to its fancy. It 
was like a case of 24-hour flu. 

In the midst of all this, as Jake 
Emspak sat in his office Sunday 
morning, behind a mound of micro- 
filmed court records dating back to 
the mid-fifties, he received a more 
serious-minded interviewer. The 
visitor was John O. Callihan, well- 
publicized sportsman, art connois- 
seur, world traveler and No. 1 man 
in the Syndicate. His mistresses, 
and a few old friends like Jake Em- 
spak, called him Johnno. 

“Greetings, Jake,” he said, easing 
his athletic, tastefully dressed frame 
into the chair in front of Jake’s 
desk. 

“Hello, Johnno,” Jake rasped. 
“I’m busy.” 

“I know. That’s why I came.” 

“I can’t talk about this case, 
Johnno.” 

“I’m not asking you to.” 

Johnno lit a long, pencil-thin 
cigarette, and continued reflective- 

ly- 

“Jake, I’ve given you some big 
cases, paid you well — and always 
let you handle them clean, in your 
own way. Right?” 

“Right enough.” 

“This is the first time I’ve ever 
come for a favor, Jake.” 

“Yeah?” 

“Who’s paying for Tony Cor- 
fino?” 



44 



FRANK RILEY 




“Nobody you have to worry 
about, Johnno.” 

“No other Syndicate — or any- 
thing like that?” 

Jake shook his head, and his 
caller stood up. 

“Thanks, Jake.” 

“Now, will you get the hell out 
of here!” 

“Sure, Jake — give my love to 
Marge.” 

Jake lowered his head to hide 
the mist in his eyes. Johnno had 
sent a simple corsage of blue violets 
to Marge’s funeral. And he sent 
one every year, on the anniversary 
of her death. 

Jake went back to Crould v. 
Gould, 243 App. Div. 589, and 
stayed with it until nearly six 
o’clock, when he turned wearily to 
People V. Gibbs. This looked like an 
interminable case, even on micro- 
film. His eyes were strained from 
staring at the viewer screen, and his 
big hand was stiff* from spinning 
the reel crank. He opened his fin- 
gers, and the knuckles cracked. 
Jake stared disgustedly at them. 
You could take a boy out of the 
coal mines, but not the coal mines 
out of the boy. His hand was too 
big for such a small crank. Some- 
day, he’d have to buy an automatic 
viewer, or even one of those elec- 
tronic brains they demonstrated at 
the last Bar Association meeting. 
But then, he wouldn’t need any- 
thing after this case. And besides, 
he didn’t trust such impersonal 
help. Leibowitz had taught him a 
good lawyer should do his own 
preparation. Leibowitz! The Vera 
Stretz case . That was forty years 
ago! Jake shook his head to chase 

A QUESTION OF IDENTITY 



away the memories, and started 
People V. Gibbs, patiently searching 
for points of law to help him prove 
that a punk named Tony Cor- 
fino . 



W HEN COURT reconvened on 
Monday morning, the week- 
end’s publicity showed its results. A 
bailiff whimpered to Jake that peo- 
ple had been waiting for the doors 
to open since five A.M. Thousands 
had gone home disappointed. The 
fortunate who did get seats filled 
the courtroom with babble and 
shrillness as they waited impatiently 
for something to happen. A new 
note of excitement sounded when 
Tony Corfino walked in beside a 
Sheriffs Deputy. Jake had insisted 
that Tony be carefully groomed 
and dressed each morning before 
coming into court, and the women 
among the spectators buzzed with 
appreciation. 

Promptly at ten. Judge Hayward 
stepped out of his chambers and 
looked, gimlet-eyed, over the court- 
room. The hubub quieted, then 
faded to stillness. Jake was glad to 
have Judge Hayward on this case. 
At forty-seven, he was the youngest 
Superior Court judge and least 
wedded to precedent. He was im- 
patient with legal sleight-of-hand, 
painstakingly insistent on a struc- 
ture of evidence. “Any mule can 
kick a barn down; it takes a good 
carpenter to build one,” he had 
once told Jake. 

Selection of the jury proceeded 
at a creeping pace, which court re- 
porters had come to expect with 
both the D.A. and Jake Emspak 

45 




in the same courtroom. In their last 
clash, they had meticulously ex- 
amined one hundred and fifty 
jurors before accepting twelve. But 
this time, the District Attorney was 
responsible for most of the delay. 
Not knowing why Jake had taken 
the case, the D.A. proceeded nerv- 
ously and cautiously in questioning 
each juror: What is your feeling 
about capital punishment? Would 
you credit the testimony of an eye 
witness? Do you believe that a crim- 
inal must be punished as decreed 
by law? 

Jake’s questions were fewer, and 
less orthodox. Sometimes he asked : 
“What is your attitude toward sci- 
ence?” Or, again: “Are you a re- 
ligious man?” But most frequently 
he came without preamble to what 
seemed to be the key to his case : 

“What is a man?” 

And while this went on in the 
courtroom, Jake continued his tire- 
less preparations. Research, sub- 
poenas, talking to witnesses, taking 
depositions, then more research and 
more subpoenas. Bound the case on 
the east, the north, the south and 
the west. Lincoln had said that. 
Jake’s stomach rebelled, and he 
took to eating a bowl of baby cereal 
before going to bed in an effort to 
still its growling and grumbling. 
Those who knew how hard he 
worked continued to ask: Where’s 
the money coming from? Why is 
this important anyway? 

Whenever speculation started to 
sag, Jake shrewly needled it by leak- 
ing a fact here, a rumor there. From 
Los Angeles, the ebullient old tele- 
vision commentator, George Put- 
nam, still indefatigable in his late 

46 



sixties, reported that a noted brain 
surgeon had been subpoenaed to 
testify at the Corfino trial. In New 
York, Ed Murrow asked the prob- 
ing, provocative question : Why has 
Jake Emspak personally invited one 
of our great religious philosophers 
to appear as a defense witness? 

“I suggest,” hinted Murrow, 
“that you won’t find the gold in this 
case by panning the mainstream. 
Or, as Plato said . .” 

The D.A. and his deputies sat 
up half the night studying an air- 
check of the Murrow broadcast. 

By the close of the fourth day, 
selection of the jury had been com- 
pleted and the trial was ready to 
begin. That evening, Jake worked 
on his notes until ten o’clock, and 
then went out for liis customary 
walk through the memories and 
quiet of Central Park. As he paused 
at a crosswalk to watch a satellite 
platform sweep like a new planet 
across the sky, a long, black car 
drifted silently to a stop beside him. 

The door swung open, and the 
District Attorney’s tired voice said, 
“Get in, Jake.” 

Jake got in, and neither of them 
spoke for awhile. 

“Couldn’t sleep,” the D.A. said 
finally. “Can’t even sleep with them 
damn pills anymore.” 

Jake didn’t say anything. He 
stared at the back of the chauffeur 
in front of them. What could you 
say when an old friend was wear- 
ing out? 

“Look, Jake,” the D.A. con- 
tinued, “do you really rnean this is 
your last case?” 

“You know I do.” 

“Then, how about a deal — You 

FRANK RILEY 




cop a plea, and Tony gets off with 
life . 

“Why, Emmett?” 

“I don’t want to see you wind up 
this way, Jake — losing a penny-ante 
case like this!” 

“You know how I feel about this 
case.” 

“No deal, then?” 

“No deal.” 

The D.A. wheezed angrily: 

“Then I’m going to whip you, 
Jake — and that punk’s going to 
burn!” 

Jake didn’t answer, and they 
drove slowly along the endless, 
winding roads of Central Park. The 
tires of the great car murmured 
over the pavement like a boat in the 
ripples of a lake, and the silent mo- 
tor gave them a sensation of float- 
ing through the night. 

NGER STILL fired the D.A.’s 
voice when he made his open- 
ing address to the jury. His final 
words were brutally to the point : 

“We’ve all heard rumors about 
what the defense may or may not 
attempt to prove in this trial, but 
let us not forget that in the law of 
our land there is no place for med- 
ical quacks, parole panderers or all 
the bleeding hearts who drip sym- 
pathy for a killer like Tony Gorfino! 
The chair is the only thing he and 
others like him will ever under- 
stand!” 

The courtroom stilled to breath- 
lessness as Jake Emspak stepped 
forward to deliver his own opening 
remarks. He moved, then paused, 
with a great dramatist’s sense of 
timing. Ghosts of a thousand court- 

A QUESTION OF IDENTITY 



rooms and fifty years of practice 
moved and paused with him. Im- 
peccably dressed, his long silver hair 
artfully disheveled, he folded his 
blue- veined hands over the gold 
head of his cane and swayed for a 
moment in silence, thoughtfully 
contemplating the jurors. When he 
spoke, his voice had a quality of re- 
moteness that was peculiarly com- 
pelling: 

“I would like,” he began, “to 
quote from a Supreme Court Jus- 
tice who died before some of you 
were born. It was Benjamin Car- 
doza who said — ‘Law in its deepest 
aspects is one with the humanities 
and with all the things by which 
humanity is uplifted and inspired. 
Law is not a cadaver, but a spirit; 
not a finality, but a process of be- 
coming; not a clog in the fullness 
of life, but an outlet and a means 
thereto; not a game but a sacra- 
ment’ . .” 

He waited fully a half-minute be- 
fore continuing, and not a person 
in the courtroom stirred. 

“The defense,” Jake went on 
quietly, “will rest its case on two 
major points: 

“First, we will prove that the law 
has not kept pace with the progress 
of science and the forward march 
of human thought. 

“Second . here Jake paused 
again, while he looked slowly from 
the jurors, to the judge and finally 
to the District Attorney. “Second,” 
he continued, with a ghost of a 
smile on his thin lips, “we will prove 
that T ony Corfino is not T ony Cor- 
finor 

Jake stood for a moment in si- 
lence. Then, with a slight, almost 




47 




curt nod of his head, he turned 
away and walked back to his seat 
beside Tony Corfino. Tony stared 
at him wordlessly, with a look in 
his eyes that Jake had not yet 
fathomed. 

The courtroom exploded into 
bedlam. Judge Hayward gaveled 
peremptorily for silence, and mo- 
tioned to the District Attorney to 
begin presentation of the People’s 
case. 

If the D.A. was puzzled by Jake’s 
opening remarks, he gave no sign 
of it. His marshalling of the evi- 
dence was grimly efficient. There 
was a quality of the inexorable 
about the way he moved up his 
witnesses one by one. It was like the 
maneuvering of a skilled boxer who 
seeks to take his opponent out, not 
with one punch, but with a care- 
fully executed combination of 
punches. 

Tony Corfino was not Tony Cor- 
fino? The D.A. smiled sardonically 
as he pointed to the pale defendant 
and asked the witness to identify 
him. 

“And is this the man who en- 
tered the bank on the morning of 
last October 17?” 

“Yes, it is,” replied the nervous, 
overly plump young woman. 

“Were you in a position to ob- 
serve him closely at all times?” 

“Yes.” 

“Where were you?” 

“In — in the Note Window , . • 
right next to where he — he came 
up and pointed his gun.” 

“Thank you.” 

With elaborate courtesy, the D.A. 
turned to Jake: 

“Does the distinguished defense 



counsel desire to cross-examine this 
witness?” 

Jake nodded gravely, and ad- 
vanced toward the witness stand. 
The young woman watched him 
apprehensively. In the TV booth, 
the regular court reporters leaned 
forward with anticipation. Many a 
time had they seen Jake Emspak 
take the most positive witness and 
reduce him to a quivering, stutter- 
ing symbol of uncertainty. “Show 
me an eye witness,” Jake had once 
observed, “and I’ll show you a 
liar.” 

Now, as Jake began, there was a 
note of friendliness in his voice: 
“You say this is the man who en- 
tered the bank on the morning of 
last October 17?” 

“Yes — yes, sir . It is!” 

Jake nodded understandingly. 
“Suppose,” he continued, “we 
look at it another way for a mo- 
ment: Is the man who entered the 
bank on the morning of last Octo- 
ber 17 the same man who now ap- 
pears as defendant in this trial?” 
The young woman bit her lip, 
smearing some of the lipstick on 
her large front teeth. She hesitated, 
thinking through the question, then 
nodded firmly. 

“Yes — of course!” 

“How do you know?” 

“Why — he — he looks the same!” 
"'Exactly the same? I suggest you 
look him over carefully before you 
answer.” 

The young woman stared at 
Tony, then dropped her eyes in con- 
fusion. 

"Exactly the same?” Jake 
pressed.

“Well . I’m . I’m not 
sure ...” 

Jake teetered on the point of his 
cane, thoughtfully contemplating 
the now flustered witness. Then, 
unexpectedly, he turned to Judge 
Hayward and said, 

“No further questions, your 
Honor.” 

The D.A. blinked in surprise. It 
was not like Jake to stop once he 
had a witness in full retreat. The 
court reporters looked at each other 
disappointedly. Maybe the old man 
should retire! 

Jake continued to treat prosecu- 
tion witnesses with similar restraint. 
He would lead them up to the brink 
of uncertainty, then leave them 
there. As a result, the District At- 
torney was able to complete pres- 
entation of his case by the middle 
of the second morning. 

“The People rest,” he an- 
nounced, with grim satisfaction. 

AKE EMSPAK’S first defense 
witness was a youthful looking 
man of about forty who quickly 
identified himself as a well-known 
authority on fingerprints, an expert 
who had many times been called to 
assist the police in major criminal 
cases. 

“Is it not true,” Jake began, 
“that in the tradition of modern 
law, fingerprints are regarded as the 
most positive method of identifica- 
tion?” 

“That is correct.” 

From a mass of data on his desk, 
Jake extracted a single sheet of pho- 
tostatic copy and handed it to Judge 
Hayward. 

A QUESTION OF IDENTITY 



“I have here,” he said, “a certi- 
fied copy of one Tony Corfino’s fin- 
gerprints — taken at the time of his 
arrest and conviction five years 
ago on a charge of Grand Theft, 
Auto . .” 

The Judge accepted the photo- 
stat and handed it to the clerk for 
entry into the record. Jake then re- 
trieved it, and gave it to his wit- 
ness. 

“Now, Sir,” he went on, “will 
you please take the defendant’s fin- 
gerprints and compare them to this 
photostatic copy.” 

The jurors craned forward curi- 
ously as the fingerprint expert 
opened his kit and went method- 
ically about the business of finger- 
printing Tony Corfino. When he 
had finished, and returned to the 
witness stand with the new prints, 
Jake Emspak demanded: 

“Is there any similarity between 
those fingerprints and the finger- 
prints of one Tony Corfino?” 

The expert looked from one set 
of prints to the other, and quickly 
replied : 

“There can be absolutely no 
doubt about it — these are not the 
same prints.” 

Red-faced with anger, the Dis- 
trict Attorney heaved himself to his 
feet and strode toward the bench. 

“Objection, your Honor!” he 
stormed. “This is the most out- 
rageous deception I have ever wit- 
nessed in a courtroom. Frankly, I 
am astounded that opposing coun- 
sel would stoop to such tactics!” 
Judge Hayward’s voice had the 
bite of steel drill as he directed : 
“Will you please explain to the 
Court exactly what you mean?” 



49 




“It’s a matter of record,” the 
D.A. snapped, “that the defendant 
was seriously injured in the acci- 
dent that resulted in his capture. 
Massive burns were part of his in- 
juries . Bone and skin grafts were 
necessary to repair the damage to 
his hands — as well as to other parts 
of his body. Naturally, his finger- 
prints would be different! The De- 
fense Counsel knows that!” 

Jake smiled, and replied mildly: 
“Of course the Defense Counsel 
knows that, and will certainly make 
the full extent of the defendant’s 
injuries a part of the trial record. 
However, I have called this partic- 
ular witness to show that Tony Cor- 
fino cannot be identified as Tony 
Corfino by what is still regarded as 
the most infallible method of crim- 
inal identification.” 

“Your Honor,” retorted the 
D.A., “This so-called testimony is 
totally irrelevant and immaterial. I 
request that it be stricken from the 
record!” 

“It is most relevant to our case,” 
Jake shot back. “Furthermore, the 
Defense will prove that Tony Cor- 
fino cannot be identified as Tony 
Corfino by any known method of 
criminal identification!” 

Judge Hayward’s eyes narrowed 
speculatively. He thought the mat- 
ter over for a moment before stat- 
ing, with unconcealed interest: 
“This may well be a legal situa- 
tion without precedent. The Court 
will withhold ruling on the objec- 
tion for the time being.” 

The next defense witness was a 
specialist on agglutination of the 
blood. 

“Agglutination,” he explained, 



adjusting his glasses pedantically, 
“is a biological reaction consisting 
of the mutual adhesion of the red 
corpuscles. It is also a method of 
establishing individualization of 
blood.” 

“I see,” said Jake. Now, tell us — 
how has this method been used to 
establish identification in a criminal 
case?” 

“It is sometimes used where the 
victim’s blood leaves stains on the 
murderer’s clothing — as well as the 
victim’s own clothing. If both blood 
stains produce the same biological 
reaction, the murderer is either 
guilty — or has a great deal of ex- 
plaining to do!” 

Jake meticulously selected an- 
other exhibit from the material on 
his desk. 

“Will you identify this, please?” 

“It is a piece of cotton stained 
with the blood of this — this defend- 
ant.” 

“When was it stained?” 

“In the test I made last week.” 

“Did you compare it with the 
stains on garments worn by a cer- 
tain Tony Corfino at the time of his 
accident?” 

“I did.” 

“What did you find?” 

“The two samples were entirely 
different?” 

“Could we assume, then, that the 
blood of a man known as Tony 
Corfino does not flow through the 
veins of this defendant, who also 
bears the name of Tony Corfino?” 

The witness rubbed his hand 
thoughtfully over the high, polished 
dome of his forehead. 

“You could put it that way,” he 
conceded.

With the skill of a symphony con- 
ductor calling upon the diverse in- 
struments under his baton, Jake 
Emspak continued to bring forward 
a bewildering variety of witnesses to 
prove tliat in the identifiable details 
of his physiology, Tony Gorfino in- 
deed was not Tony Gorfino. The 
D.A. watched in furious silence. 
Once, when Jake passed near him, 
he muttered: 

“This is contemptible!” 

Imperturbably, Jake turned back 
to the witness stand, where a radio- 
grapher from Scripps Institute was 
taking the oath. Patiently, he led 
the witness through a description of 
how the radiographies of the nasal 
accessory sinuses and mastoid proc- 
esses could be used to establish the 
identity of an individual. Jake then 
produced medical records from a 
juvenile correctional institution in 
eastern Pennsylvania, where Tony 
Gorfino had sojourned during his 
seventeenth year. Gomparison with 
recent hospital records showed a 
striking difference between the two 
radiographies. 

The opthalmologic method of 
Gapdevieile was next explored by 
Jake to show that the eyes of Tony 
Gorfino were not the eyes of Tony 
Gorfino. The technique of Tamas- 
sia and Ameuille was employed to 
prove the same point about Tony’s 
veins. The umbilicial method of 
Bert and Vianny intrigued the 
courtroom and TV audience with 
structural dissimilarities of Tony’s 
navel. By means of projection on a 
large screen, Jake demonstrated to 
the jurors and Judge Hayward that 
Tony Gorfino, defendant, had an 
entirely different electrocardiagram 

A QUESTION OF IDENTITY 



from the Tony Gorfino whose 
crushed body had been pulled, more 
dead than alive, from the wreckage 
of a burning automobile. 

Late that afternoon, Ed Murrow 
commented to his news audience in 
the cadence that had been his 
trademark for more than forty 
years: 

“We know not yet where this 
trial is taking us, though Jake Em- 
spak is beginning to show the di- 
rection. Perhaps, we, too, could ask 
ourselves the question: What is a 
man?*' 

Less philosophically, a space- 
weary young captain, sending in his 
nightly report from the satellite sta- 
tion, Vanguard VI, queried: - 

“If this Tony Gorfino isn’t Tony 
Gorfino, who or what in the hell is 
he?” 



P ART OF the answer to this 
question was on display the 
next morning when the jury filed 
into Judge Hayward’s courtroom. 
Before them, and angled toward 
the TV cameras, was a chart nearly 
eight feet tall. It showed, in outline, 
the figure of a man. The figure was 
covered with small black dots, each 
bearing a white number. In all, 
there was seventy-two dots. 

As soon as court was in session, 
Jake called a short, squarely-built 
man of about fifty to the stand. 
There was a bulldog set to his jaw 
and mouth. He identified himself 
as Dr. Theodore Glendenning, 
Ghief of Staff at Gity Hospital. 

“Dr. Glendenning,” said Jake, “I 
assume you are familiar with the 
medical and surgical care received 

51 




by the defendant at your hospital?” 
“Quite familiar,” the doctor re- 
torted, impatiently. 

“Then, may I direct your atten- 
tion to this chart. It indicates areas 
in which artificial parts were used 
to replace the damaged or de- 
stroyed natural parts of a certain 
Tony Corfino’s body. Will you 
name them, please, as I point them 
out with my cane.” 

Tapping the chart like a school- 
teacher signalling for the attention 
of his pupils, Jake Emspak started 
at the outline of the head. 

“Vitallium skull plate,” snapped 
Dr. Glendenning. 

Jake’s cane touched the nose. 
“Vitallium nose plate.” 

Swiftly, the tip of the cane moved 
around the outline of the body, 
pausing only long enough for the 
doctor to name each part: 

“Plastic tear duct . vitallium 
jaw bone and implanted dentures 
. paraffin and plastic sponge to 
fill chest after removal of lung . 
plastic esophagus . tantalum 
breast plate . tantalum mesh to 
patch chest wall . vitallium shoul- 
der socket rim and shoulder joint 
bone . vitallium elbow joint, ra- 
dius bone, ulna bone, wrist bone, 
finger joint . spinal fusion plate 
. vitallium blood vessel tubes.” 
Jake put down his cane, and 
turned conversationally toward the 
doctor. 

“Dr. Glendenning, is it true that 
this Tony Gorfino’s reproductive 
organs were destroyed in the acci- 
dent?” 

“Virtually so.” 

“And is it not also true that the 
defendant in this case is now cap- 



able of becoming a parent?” 

Dr. Glendenning glanced at his 
watch and sighed. 

“What you are referring to,” he 
answered, “has been rather elemen- 
tary surgery for the past ten years.” 
“But the children of Tony Gor- 
fino would not then be the children 
of Tony Gorfino?” 

Dr. Glendenning looked toward 
Judge Hayward with a pained ex- 
pression. Receiving no sign of any 
kind from the Judge, he turned 
back to Jake Emspak. 

“I have given you the medical 
data,” he said angrily. “You can 
draw your own conclusions.” 

Jake nodded, and replied with 
emphasis : 

“I am sure this Gourt and the 
Jury will do just that.” 

He studied the chart for a mo- 
ment, then tapped the outline fig- 
ure in the area of the eyes. 

“Tell us. Dr. Glendenning, what 
did your staff do about Tony Gor- 
fino’s eyes? I understand the flames 
had reached them. 

“Gomea transplants were neces- 
sary.” 

“And where did you obtain the 
corneas?” 

“Mr. Emspak — I’m sure you 
know that most people nowadays 
will their eyes to the Gornea Bank!” 
“Gan you tell us anything about 
the corneas that were transplanted 
in Tony Gorfino’s eyes? From what 
type a person did they come?” 

“I’d rather not answer that?” 
Jake turned to the Judge. 

“Your Honor, unless there is a 
legal reason why the good doctor 
should not answer, I ask the Gourt 
to direct that he do so.”

FRANK RILEY 




Judge Hayward hesitated, then 
directed the witness to answer. 

“They came from the eyes of a 
priest,” growled the doctor. 

Jake Emspak raised his cane to 
the chart once again, then appar- 
ently changed his mind and low- 
ered it. 

“Dr. Clendenning,” he asked 
quietly, “am I correct in believing 
that the construction of parts for 
the human body is now an impor- 
tant industry?” 

“That’s right,” the doctor said 
grudgingly. “It’s grown tremen- 
dously in the past twenty years — 
from a $160-million-a-year business 
in 1957 to nearly a billion to- 
day . .” 

“One further question, if you 
please, Doctor,” said Jake. “What 
is your definition of a man?” 

The doctor thought for a mo- 
ment, and smiled coldly. 

“I’m afraid it would not assist 
your case,” he replied. 

“We are only looking for some 
basic truths.” 

Dr. Clendenning bunched his 
square shoulders and leaned for- 
ward aggressively. 

“I can think of no better defini- 
tion,” he snapped, “than one given 
by a distinguished physician in the 
earlier years of this century. He de- 
fined the human body as an animal 
organism, differing in only a few 
respects from other animal organ- 
isms, and fitted for the performance 
of two main functions: The con- 
version of food and air into energy 
and tissue; and the reproduction of 
other individuals of its species!” 

So coldly, with such an air of 
finality did he speak, that his words 

A QUESTION OF IDENTITY 



brought an audible gasp from two 
women in the jury box. Jake Em- 
spak remained impassive. 

“And this is all you see in a 
man?” he prodded gently. 

The doctor’s jaw set stubbornly. 
“As a philosopher,” he retorted, 
“I may engage in some speculation 
in the company of Plato, Schopen- 
hauer or the Archbishop of Canter- 
bury, but my speculations would 
themselves be based upon specula- 
tions and not upon any scientific 
data resembling observed facts!” 
“Then, from your point of view, 
the defendant in this courtroom is 
not the Tony Corfino — the same 
man — ^whose broken body was 
brought into your hospital eight 
months ago?” 

“Obviously not.” 

“Thank you. Doctor.” 

Jake walked slowly from the wit- 
ness stand to the jury box, and then 
back to the bench. 

“Perhaps,” he said softly, “a ten- 
minute recess would be in or- 
der . .” 

Judge Hayward drew a long 
breath, exhaled and nodded. With 
the sound of his gavel, tension ran 
out of the courtroom like water 
from a punctured barrel. 

W HEN COURT reconvened, 
Jake began bringing to the 
witness stand a parade of educators, 
religious leaders and philosophers 
who kept the courtroom alternately 
fascinated and bewildered for the 
next two days. They came from 
London, Rome, Johannesburg, 
Philadelphia, Tokyo and Chicago. 
They came from every oasis of 

53 




learning where men could still find 
profit in thought, without relating 
the profit to the cash register or the 
thought of technology. They spoke 
in words and symbols that some- 
times soared beyond space itself, 
and left the world’s TV audience 
groping for stability in earthbound 
cliches. The paradox was incredi- 
ble: All this thinking, all this cul- 
ture — all of everything brought into 
a courtroom to defend a bush- 
league hoodlum. Reporters ceased 
to ask who was paying for this dis- 
play; they simply marveled at the 
pyrotechnics. Through it all, Jake 
Emspak moved deftly, surely, ex- 
tracting from each witness the pure 
essence of relevant thought : 

Man is a creature destined to live 
in two worlds. He is surrounded 
first by the realities of this world — 
and he is called to live with eter- 
nal realities that transcend this 
^vorld . 

The human person is a body, and 
therefore subject to the laws of 
matter, to spatiality, temporality 
and opacity. As such, he is a meet- 
ing place for passing forces, a cross- 
roads of contacts and reactions. 
But the human person is also a 
spirit, that is to say a reality that 
transcends apparent reality. There 
is within him the wakened or nas- 
cent ability to comprehend space 
and surpass time . 

The human self is an object, of a 
sort — and, as such, can be described 
as the empiricists have described us. 
But the human self is also, and 
more essentially, a subject, which 
never appears to the view of others 
or even to the most determined in- 
trospection. The self as object is 

54 



finite, but the self as subject touches 
the infinite; it is the meeting place 
of time and eternity, of man and 
God . 

For all its advances, the 20th cen- 
tury is still a child of the 19th, 
when the impact of the developing 
sciences of physics and biology pro- 
duced a change in the concept of 
nature and Man’s place in it. From 
Malthus and Darwin, Spencer and 
Feuerbach, Vogt, Buchner, Czolbe 
and Haeckel evolved a reductive 
naturalism in which the spiritual 
quality of man is ruled out and he 
becomes a unique emergent of a 
blind natural process — a creature 
who must make of nature what he 
can . 

The next five million years of 
evolution will be in the human 
brain, where Man must ultimately 
be defined. Until Man appeared, 
evolution strove only to produce an 
organ, the brain, in a body capable 
of protecting it, and carrying out its 
will. The ancestors of Man were ir- 
responsible actors playing parts in a 
play they did not understand. Man 
continues to play his part but wants 
to understand the play . 

Man is a blending of the rational 
and intuitive processes. Ethical con- 
clusions reached by logical thinking 
were attained several thousand 
years ago by the religions, which 
proves that man’s rational processes 
are strangely slower than his intui- 
tive processes . 

Jurors shifted impatiently in their 
seats, yet their attention would in- 
exorably be drawn back to the wit- 
ness stand. Courtroom spectators, 
who had come to be titillated by 
the sensational, stayed to grope 

FRANK RILEY 




with concepts they could not under- 
stand. The TV audience, spoon- 
fed for so many decades, tried dog- 
gedly to chew and digest adult 
foodstuffs. Sets were turned off in 
anger or despair — and then turned 
back on again. 

“What is a man?” 

The pivotal nature of this ques- 
tion became steadily more evident. 

If Tony Gorfino was not Tony 
Corfino, was he then not more of 
the real personality, the human en- 
tity, than the original Tony had 
ever been. 

“In restoring the damaged areas 
of the brain,” a surgeon testified 
under Jake’s skillful prodding, “we 
thought it wise to perform a lo- 
botomy at the same time, thereby 
relieving anti-social tensions and 
pressures.” 

(The body is at once a means of 
expression for the soul, and a veil; 
it reveals and it hides . ) 

“During the convalescent peri- 
od,” a consulting specialist informed 
the courtroom, “we recommended 
treatment with sodium dilantin and 
electroshock therapy, thereby pro- 
ducing a change in this patient’s 
electroencephalograph.” 

(The body presents all the prob- 
lems of matter: It is a limitation, a 
weight, a force. It seems almost a 
miracle when it is overcome, pene- 
trated and ordered by thought and 
spirit . .) 

“Subsequently,” the psychiatrist 
stated, “this patient underwent ex- 
tensive therapy, aided frequently 
by hypnosis and sodium pentathol. 
His respiratory, vascular and circu- 
latory systems began to show in- 
creasing stability.” 

A QUESTION OF IDENTITY 



(Released from its warped frame- 
work, brought into balance with in- 
stincts inherited from our animal 
ancestors, the body becomes, in a 
way, an image of the soul, a sign 
conveying something of our per- 
sonal mystery . .) 

And then Jake called the hospital 
Administrator to the stand. Speak- 
ing with great deliberation, so that 
each word registered, Jake asked: 

“Is this type of medical care 
ordinarily given to a prisoner- 
patient?” 

“The type of care depends upon 
the case, Mr. Emspak. In a case 
such as this, I would regard the 
treatment as routine. You see, in 
the past decade our approach to 
any patient has become one of total 
therapy. .” 

“And in the case of a prisoner, 
what do you do when the therapy 
is completed?” 

The Administrator looked sur- 
prised. 

“Why, we return him to jail — in 
accordance with the law.” 

Jake Emspak stood in silence, 
contemplatively staring down at 
the blue veins on the back of his 
hands. At length, he announced: 

“Your Honor, the Defense will 
conclude tomorrow morning, after 
one more witness — a man who goes 
by the name of Tony Gorfino . 

T he sweat on the pale, pol- 
ished skin of Tony’s forehead 
stood out like drops of summer 
rain; they seemed to have fallen 
there rather than seeped out 
through the pores. 

A polygraph lie detector had 

55 




been set up under Jake’s direction 
and wheeled close to the witness 
stand. A technician opened the 
front of Tony’s shirt and made fast 
the pneumograph tube with the aid 
of a beaded chain. Next, a blood- 
pressure cuff, of the type used by 
physicians, was fasted around 
Tony’s right arm. A set of elec- 
trodes was attached to the palmar 
and dorsal surfaces of the hand of 
the other arm. The recorder show- 
ing the graph lines had been spe- 
cially constructed so as to be visible 
throughout the courtroom, and to 
the television cameras. 

The technician had already been 
on the stand to explain the simpli- 
fied and easily read graph lines of 
the modern polygraph: A shallow 
breathing line denoting suppres- 
sion; a heavy breath line denoting 
relief; the respiratory block, fast 
pulse and slow pulse lines; the rise 
in blood pressure tracing ... It was 
all there on the screen — the emo- 
tional picture of a man testifying at 
his own trial for murder. 

“Objection, your Honor!” 
shouted the D.A. for the tenth time 
that morning. “This procedure is 
definitely irregular and imma- 
terial! Defense Counsel has been 
making a mockery of the Court 
for days, but now he has stepped 
completely out of line!” 

Jake clucked soothingly. 

“What,” he inquired, “is irregu- 
lar or immaterial about a defendant 
voluntarily taking a lie detector 
test? I believe that I have heard the 
District Attorney challenge clients 
of mine to do so on several occa- 
sions! Now, we are merely permit- 
ting the Court and the Jury to view 



the test in progress . 

Once again, the Judge withheld 
his ruling, and the D.A. sagged de- 
jectedly in his chair. The strain of 
the last few days — sitting in the 
courtroom and listening to witnesses 
he knew not how or why to cross- 
examine — had taken its toll. His 
eyes were bloodshot, ^ and fits of 
wheezing seized him spasmodically, 
but the set of his jaw was still un- 
yielding. Jake grieved for him. 

Tony Gorfino’s reactions, as he 
sat in the witness chair watching 
the final preparations, would be dif- 
ficult to catalogue. He looked both 
aloof and nervously concerned. His 
curly black hair was damp from the 
way he constantly brushed the 
sweat back off his forehead; his 
puffy lips seemed in constant need 
of moistening. But his hands were 
folded quietly in his lap. He seemed 
to Jake like a man lost to the past, 
adrift in the present and unrelated 
to the future. 

“Will you . give us your name, 
please?” Jake asked casually. 

“Tony Corfino.” 

“Where were you born?” 

“I ain’t — I’m not sure . On 
the West Side, I suppose . .” 

On the recorder over Tony’s 
head, the graph lines rippled in 
smooth patterns. 

Suddenly changing his manner, 
Jake rasped: 

“Have you ever committed a 
crime?” 

Tony frowned in bewilderment. 
“I know that I have, but some- 
times . Well, I kinda wonder . .” 
“Do you remember what hap- 
pened last October 17?” 

“You mean the bank . the 



56 



FRANK RILEY 




shootin’?” 

“That’s right.” 

“I’ve read so much — heard so 
much talk — that I ain’t sure just 
what I remember . 

Tony’s eyes — or the eyes of the 
dead priest through which Tony 
had vision — reflected his torment. 
Jake moved around so that Tony 
would be facing the jury when he 
answered the next question. 

“Tony,” directed Jake, “think 
about this question before you an- 
swer it: Are you the man who tried 
to rob that bank — then got excited 
and killed two people?” 

Jake knew this question was the 
one element of gamble in his entire 
case. The way it was answered 
could be a summation or refutation 
of all the evidence and testimony 
he had so painstakingly assembled. 

The jury sensed this, too. So did 
Judge Hayward. His keen eyes flick- 
ered alertly from the defendant’s 
face to the lines on the polygtaph 
recorder. 

Now Tony’s hands were no 
longer folded quietly in his lap. 
They were locked together, and the 
new veins in his wrists stood out 
under the new skin. His lips worked 
silently as he groped for words. 

And then the words burst into an 
anguished outcry: 

“No! I couldn’t! . 

The polygraph lines leaped into 
jagged peaks. Blood pressure, respir- 
atory block, pulse and breathing — 
all climbed and dropped wildly, re- 
cording their damning message for 
the world to see. 

The D.A.’s lips twisted in a 
mirthless smile of triumph. Up in 
the TV booth, reporters sputtered, 

A QUESTION OF IDENTITY 



split infinitives and shattered syntax 
in frantic efforts to describe and in- 
terpret what had happened. 

Jake Emspak stood and waited, a 
sear and wrinkled leaf hanging mo- 
tionless in the wind. 

(If the self is merely a node in a 
complex casual series, if self is sole- 
ly energized and motivated by the 
sovereign need of survival and se- 
curity, then the idea of a bridge be- 
tween Man and the infinite is a 
pious illusion . .) 

Tony Corfino stared down at his 
twisted hands, and slowly they un- 
locked. He looked up at Jake, and 
the doubt and fear and bewilder- 
ment were gone at last from his 
eyes. 

“That ain’t so,” he said quietly. 
“I did it ... I know I did it . 
an’ I know it was wrong ... I de- 
serve the chair!” 

(Thus Man escapes himself in 
freedom, and is therefore never a 
fully predictable or manipulatable 
object — only a window through 
which we peer with blind eyes into 
the reaches of the universe . .) 



T he District Attorney’s sum- 
mary to the jury was a model 
of legal craftsmanship. Boldly dis- 
regarding the broader issues raised 
by Jake, he hewed firmly to the line 
of criminal responsibility and pun- 
ishment. 

Point by point he reviewed the 
facts of the crime. Witness by wit- 
ness he retraced the eye-witness 
testimony. He produced photo- 
graphs of Tony’s body being loaded 
from the wreckage of the car into

bulance into the prison ward of 
City Hospital. He proved beyond 
any reasonable doubt that Tony 
had never been out of custody from 
the moment of his apprehension. 

“Even the defendant admits to 
his responsibility for the crime,” the 
D.A. continued coldly. 

Only in his concluding remarks 
did the District Attorney make ref- 
erence to the defense presented by 
Jake Emspak. 

“I wonder,” he asked, smiling for 
the first time, “if any of you tried — 
as I did — to carry through to its 
ultimate conclusion the line of rea- 
soning presented with such detail 
and admitted virtuosity by the de- 
fendant’s counsel? If the fabricat- 
ing of replacement parts for the 
human body has already become a 
billion dollar industry, if psychiatry 
continues to achieve new miracles, 
how many people in this world 
could now — or in the near future — 
seek to escape their resp>onsibilities 
by taking refuge in the argument 
that they were no longer them- 
selves? At what point would we 
draw the line? If fifty-percent of a 
man’s body has been replaced is he 
neither himself nor a new person? 
If fifty-one has been replaced, is he 
no longer the husband of his wife 
or the father of his children? Can 
he then walk blithely away from 
his responsibilities, proclaiming T 
am a new man’?” 

A titter went through the court- 
room. Judge Hayward gavelled im- 
mediately for silence, but the D.A. 
winked at the TV cameras. His 
point had been well made. 

When Jake Emspak stepped up 
to the jury box to deliver his own 



final plea, he promptly picked up 
the challenge. 

“I have known the District At- 
torney too well, for too many 
years,” he said, “to believe that he 
has considered only the superficial 
aspects of this case. If you should 
find the defendant guilty, I am sure 
he would be the last to oppose con- 
sideration of all the matters I have 
raised in the determination of a just 
sentence. 

“And I grant you that if a ver- 
dict of guilty is reached, the letter 
of the law will be fulfilled, and an 
eye for an eye can be paid. 

“Likewise, if the verdict is not 
guilty, the letter of the law most 
unquestionably will be violated — 
but its spirit will be vindicated! 

“I am asking you to take a bold 
step, across a new frontier . Yes, 
down through the ages, law has be- 
come a living, meaningful instru- 
ment of human dignity because — at 
each crossroad of decision — ^men 
and women were not afraid to de- 
part from precedent!” 

Old timers in the court had never 
before heard Jake Emspak sum- 
marize a case in such dispassionate, 
objective tones. Usually, his voice 
and argument ranged the gamut of 
emotional and semantic appeals, 
plucking at each member of the 
jury like the strings of a harp. To- 
day, he seemed to be making an 
effort to hold himself in check. 

“This is the trial of a living man 
for the crime of a man who no 
longer exists,” Jake continued 
quietly. “Science destroyed that 
man — completely and with absolute 
finality! In his place is a man with

HOMECOMING 



BY MIGUEL HIDALGO 



T he large horse plodded 

slowly over the shifting sand. 
The rider was of medium size, 
with huge, strong hands and seem- 
ingly hollow eyes. Strange eyes, alive 
and aflame. They had no place in 
the dust-caked, tired body, yet there 
they were, seeking, always seeking 
—searching the clear horizon, and 
never seeming to find what they 
sought. 

The horse moved faster now. 
They were nearing a river; the wa- 
ter would be welcome on tired 
bodies and dry throats. He spurred

his horse, and when they reached 
the water’s edge, he dismounted and 
unsaddled the horse. Then both 
man and horse plunged headlong 
into the waiting torrent, deep into 
the cool embrace of the clear liquid. 
They soaked it into their pores and 
drank deeply of it, feeling life going 
once more through their veins. Sat- 
isfied, they lifted themselves from 
the water, and the man lay down 
on the yellow sand of the river bank 
to sleep. 

When he awoke, the sun was al- 
most setting. The bright shafts of 
red light spilled across the sky, mak- 
ing the mountains silent scarlet 
shadows on the face of the rippling 
water. Quickly he gathered drift- 
wood, and built a small fire. From 
his pack he removed some of the 
coffee he had found in one of the 
ruined cities. He brought water 
from the river in the battered cof- 
fee-pot he had salvaged, and while 
he waited for it to boil, he went to 
his horse. Conqueror, stroking his 
mane and whispering in his ear. 
Then he led him silently to a grassy 
slope where he hobbled him and 
left him for the night. 

In the fading light, he ate the 
hard beef jerky and drank the 
scalding coffee. Refreshed and mo- 
mentarily content, he sat staring 
into the dying fire, seeing the bright 
glowing coals as living fingers 
clutching at the wood in consuming 
embrace, taking all and returning 
nothing but ashes. 

Slowly his eyelids yielded. His 
body sagged, and blood seemed to 
fill his brain, bathing it in a gentle, 
warm flood. 

He slept. His brain slept. 

60 



But the portion of his brain called 
memory stirred. It was all alone; all 
else was at rest. Images began to 
appear, drawn from inexhaustible 
files, wherein are kept all thoughts, 
past, present and future . 

It was the night before he was to 
go overseas. World War III had 
been declared, and he had enlisted, 
receiving his old rank of captain. 
He was with his wife in the living 
room of their home. They had put 
the children to bed — their sons — 
and now sat on the couch, watch- 
ing the blazing fire. It was then that 
he had showed it to her. 

“I’ve got something to tell you, 
and something to show you.” 

He had removed the box from 
his pocket and opened it. And heard 
her cry of surprised joy. 

“Oh, a ring, and it’s a diamond, 
too!” she cried in her rich, happy 
voice which always seemed to send 
a thrill through his body. 

“It’s f(3r you; so long as you wear 
it. I’ll come back, even from the 
dead, if need be. Read the inscrip- 
tion.” 

She held the ring up to the light 
and read aloud, “It is forever.” 

Then she had slipped the ring on 
her finger and her arms around 
him. He held her very close, feeling 
the warmth from her body flowing 
into his and making him oblivious 
to everything except that she was 
there in his arms and that he was 
sinking deep, deep into a familiar 
sea, where he had been many times 
before but each time found some- 
thing new and unexplored, some 
vastly different emotion he could 
never quite explain. 

MIGUEL HIDALGO 




“Wait!” she cried. “I’ve some- 
thing for you, too.” 

She took off the locket she wore 
about her neck and held it up to the 
shimmering light, letting it spin at 
the end of its chain. It caught the 
shadows of the fire and reflected 
them, greatly magnified, over the 
room. It was in the shape of a star, 
encrusted with emeralds, with one 
large ruby in the center. When he 
opened it, he found a picture of her 
in one side, and in the other a pic- 
ture of the children. He took her in 
his arms again, and loosened her 
long, black hair, burying his face in 
it for a moment. Then he kissed 
her, and instantly was drawn down 
into the abyss which seemed to have 
no beginning or any end. 

The next morning had been bleak 
and gray. The mist clung to the 
wet, sodden ground, and the air was 
heavy in his lungs. He had driven 
off in the jeep the army had sent 
for him, watching her there on the 
porch until the mist swirled around 
her feet and she ran back into the 
house and slammed the door. His 
cold fingers found the locket, mak- 
ing a little bulge under his uniform, 
and the touch of it seemed to warm 
the blood in his veins. 

Three days later they had landed 
in Spain, merged with another di- 
vision, then crossed the Pyrenees in- 
to France, and finally to Paris where 
the fighting had begun. Already 
the city was a silent graveyard, lit- 
tered with the rubble of towers and 
cathedrals which had once been 
great. 

Three years later they were on 
the road to Moscow. Over a thou- 
sand miles lay behind, a dead man 

HOMECOMING 



on every foot of those miles. Yet 
victory was near. The Russians had 
not yet used the H-bomb ; the 
threat of annihilation by the retali- 
ation forces had been too great. 

He had done well in the war, and 
had been decorated many times for 
bravery in action. Now he felt the 
victory that seemed to be in the air, 
and he had wished it would come 
quickly, so that he might return to 
her. Home. The very feel of the 
word was everything a battle-weary 
soldier needed to make him fight 
harder and live longer. 

Suddenly he had become aware 
of a droning, wooshing sound above 
him. It grew louder and louder un- 
til he knew what it was. 

“Heavy bombers!” The alarm 
had sounded, and the men had 
headed for their foxholes. 

But the planes had passed over, 
the sun glinting on their bellies, re- 
flecting a blinding light. They were 
bound for bigger, more important 
targets. When the all-clear had 
sounded, the men clambered from 
their shelters. An icy wind swept the 
field, bringing with it clouds which 
covered the sun. A strange fear had 
gripped him then . 

Across the Atlantic, over the 
pole, via Alaska, the great bombers 
flew. In cities, great and small, 
the air raid sirens sounded, high 
screaming noises which had jarred 
the people from sleep in time to 
die. The defending planes roared 
into the sky to intercept the on- 
rushing bombers. The horrendous 
battle split the universe. Many 
bombers fell, victims of fanatical 
suicide planes, or of missiles that 
streaked across the sky which none 

61 




could escape. 

But too many bombers got 
through, dropping their deadly 
cargo upon the helpless cities. And 
not all the prayers or entreaties to 
any God had stopped their carnage. 
First there had been the red flashes 
that melted buildings into molten 
streams, and then the great triple- 
mushroom cloud filled with the 
poisonous gases that the wind swept 
away to other cities, where men 
had not died quickly and merci- 
fully, but had rotted away, leaving 
shreds of putrid flesh behind to 
mark the places where they had 
crawled. 

The retaliatory forces had roared 
away to bomb the Russian cities. 
Few, if any, had returned. Too 
much blood and life were on their 
hands. Those who had remained 
alive had found a resting place on 
the crown of some distant moun- 
tain. Others had preferred the silent 
peaceful sea, where flesh stayed not 
long on bones, and only darting 
fishes and merciful beams of filtered 
light found their aluminum coffins. 

The war had ended. 

To no avail. Neither side had 
won. Most of the cities and the 
majority of the population of both 
countries had been destroyed. Even 
their governments had vanished, 
leaving a silent nothingness. The 
armies that remained were without 
leaders, without sources of supplies, 
save what they could forage and beg 
from an unfriendly people. 

They were alone now, a group 
of tired, battered men, for whom 
life held nothing. Their families had 
long since died, their bodies turned 
to dust, their spirits fled on the 

62 



winds to a new world. 

Yet these remnants of an army 
must return — or at least try. Their 
exodus was just beginning. Some- 
how he had managed to hold to- 
gether the few men left from his 
force. He had always nourished the 
hope that she might still be alive. 
And now that the war was over he 
had to return — had to know wheth- 
er she was still waiting for him. 

They had started the long trek. 
Throughout Europe anarchy 
reigned. He and his men were 
alone. All they could do now was 
fight. Finally they reached the sea- 
port city of Calais. With what few 
men he had left, he had comman- 
deered a small yacht, and they had 
taken to the sea. 

After months of storms and bad 
luck, they had been shipwrecked 
somewhere off the coast of Mexico. 
He had managed to swim ashore, 
and had been found by a fisher- 
man’s family. Many months he had 
spent swimming and fishing, re- 
covering his strength, inquiring 
about the United States. The Mexi- 
cans had spoken with fear of the 
land across the Rio Grande. All its 
great cities had been destroyed, and 
those that had been only partially 
destroyed were devoid of people. 
The land across the Rio Grande 
had become a land of shadows. The 
winds were p>oisoned, and the few 
people who might have survived, 
were crazed and maimed by the 
blasts. Few men had dared cross 
the Rio Grande into “El Mundo 
gris de Noviembre” — the November 
world. Those who had, had never 
returned. 

In time he had traveled north 
MIGUEL HIDALGO 




until he reached the Rio Grande. 
He had waded into the muddy 
waters and somehow landed on the 
American side. In the November 
world. 

It was rightly called. The deserts 
were long. All plant life had died, 
leaving to those once great fertile 
stretches, nothing but the sad, tem- 
poral beauty that comes with death. 
No people had he seen. Only the 
ruins of what had once been their 
cities. He had walked through 
them, and all that he had seen 
were the small mutant rodents, 
and all that he had heard was the 
occasional swish of the wind as it 
whisked along what might have 
been dead leaves, but wasn’t. 

He had been on the trail for a 
long time. His food was nearly ex- 
hausted. The mountains were just 
beginning, and he hoped to find 
food there. He had not found food, 
but his luck had been with him. 
He had found a horse. Not a nor- 
mal horse, but a mutation. It was 
almost twice as large as a regular 
horse. Its skin seemed to shimmer 
and was like glassy steel to the 
touch. From the center of its fore- 
head grew a horn, straight out, as 
the horn of a unicorn. But most 
startling of all were the animal’s 
eyes which seemed to speak — a 
silent mental speech, which he 
could understand. The horse had 
looked up as he approached it and 
seemed to say: “Follow me.” 

And he had followed. Over a 
mountain, until they came to a 
pass, and finally to a narrow path 
which led to an old cabin. He had 
found it empty, but there were 
cans of food and a rifle and many 

HOMECOMING 



shells. He had remained there a 
long time — how long he could not 
tell, for he could only measure time 
by the cycles of the sun and the 
moon. Finally he had taken the 
horse, the rifle and what food was 
left, and once again started the 
long journey home. 

The farther north he went, the 
more life seemed to have survived. 
He had seen great herds of horses 
like his own, stampeding across the 
plains, and strange birds which he 
could not identify. Yet he had seen 
no human beings. 

But he knew he was closer now. 
Closer to home. He recognized the 
land. How, he did not know, for it 
was much changed. A sensing, per- 
haps, of what it had once been. He 
could not be more than two days’ 
ride away. Once he was through 
this desert, he would find her, he 
would be with her once again; all 
would be well, and his long journey 
would be over. 

The images faded. Even memory 
slept in a flow of warm blood. Body 
and mind slept into the shadows of 
the dawn. 

He awoke and stretched the 
cramped muscles of his body. At the 
edge of the water he removed his 
clothes and stared at himself in 
the rippling mirror. His muscles 
were lean and hard, evenly placed 
throughout the length of his frame. 
A deep ridge ran down the length 
of his torso, separating the muscles, 
making the chest broad. Well satis- 
fied with his body, he plunged into 
the cold water, deep down, until 
he thought his lungs would burst; 
then swiftly returned to the clean 

63 




air, tingling in every pore. He dried 
himself and dressed. Conqueror was 
eating the long grass near the 
stream. Quickly he saddled him. 
No time for breakfast. He would 
ride all day and the next night. 
And he would be home. 

Still northward. The hours 
crawled slower than a dying man. 
The sun was a torch that pierced 
his skin, seeming to melt his bones 
into a burning stream within his 
body. But day at last gave way to 
night, and the sun to the moon. 
The torch became a white pock- 
marked goddess, with streaming 
hair called stars. 

In the moonlight he had not 
seen the crater until he was at its 
very edge. Even then he might not 
have seen it had not the horse 
stopped suddenly. The wind swirled 
through its vast emptiness, slapping 
his face with dusty hands. For a 
moment he thought he heard voices 
— mournful, murmuring voices, 
echoing up from the misty depths. 
He turned quickly away and did 
not look back. 

Night paled into day; day burned 
into night. 

There were clouds in the sky 
now, and a gentle wind caressed 
the sweat from his tired body. He 
stopped. There it was! Barely dis- 
cernible through the moonlight, 
he saw it. Home. 

Quickly he dismounted and ran. 
Now he could see a small light 
in the window, and he knew they 
were there. His breath came in 
hard ragged gulps. At the window 
he peered in, and as his eyes be- 
came accustomed to the inner 
gloom, he saw how bare the room 

64 



was. No matter. Now that he was 
home he would build new furni- 
ture, and the house would be even 
better than it had been before. 

Then he saw her. 

She was sitting motionless in a 
straight wooden chair beside the 
fireplace, the feeble light cast by 
the embers veiling her in mauve 
shadows. He waited, wondering if 
she were . Presently she stirred 
like a restless child in sleep, then 
moved from the chair to the pile 
of wood near the hearth, and re- 
plenished the fire. The wood caught 
quickly, sending up long tongues of 
flame, and forming a bright pool of 
light around her. 

His blood froze. The creature 
illuminated by the firelight was a 
monster. Large greasy scales cov- 
ered its face and arms, and there 
was no hair on its head. Its gums 
were toothless cavities in a sunken, 
mumbling mouth. The eyes, turned 
momentarily toward the window, 
were empty of life. 

“No, no!” he cried soundlessly. 

This was not his house. In his 
delirium he had only imagined he 
had found it. He had been search- 
ing so long. He would go on 
searching. He was turning wearily 
away from the window when the 
movement of the creature beside 
the fire held his attention. It had 
taken a ring from one skeleton-like 
finger and stood, turning the ring 
slowly as if trying to decipher some 
inscription inside it. 

He knew then. He had come 
home. 

Slowly he moved toward the 
door. A great weakness was upon 
him. His feet were stones, reluctant 

MIGUEL HIDALGO 




to leave the earth. His body was a 
weed, shriveled by thirst. He 
grasped the doorknob and clung 
to it, looking up at the night sky 
and trying to draw strength from 
the wind that passed over him. It 
was no use. There was no strength. 
Only fear — a kind of fear he had 
never known. 

He fumbled at his throat, his 
fingers crawling like cold worms 
around his neck until he found the 
locket and the clasp which had held 
it safely through endless nightmare 
days and nights. He slipped the 
clasp and the locket fell into his 
waiting hand. As one in a dream, 
he opened it, and stared at the 
pictures, now in the dim moonlight 
no longer faces of those he loved, 
but grey ghosts from the past. Even 
the ruby had lost its glow. What 
had once been living fire was now 



a dull glob of darkness. 

“Nothing is forever!’* He thought 
he had shouted the words, but only 
a thin sound, the sound of leaves 
ruffled by the wind, came back to 
him. 

He closed the locket and fastened 
the clasp, and hung it on the door- 
knob. It moved slowly in the wind, 
back and forth, like a pendulum. 
“Forever — forever. Only death is 
forever.” He could have sworn he 
heard the words. 

He ran. Away from the house. 
To the large horse with a horn in 
the center of its forehead, like a 
unicorn. Once in the saddle, the 
spurt of strength left him. His 
shoulders slumped, his head 
dropped onto his chest. 

Conqueror trotted away, the 
sound of his hooves echoing hollow- 
ly in the vast emptiness. END

HOMECOMING 





C O N S E R VAT I O N 



BY CHARLES L. FONTENAY 



T he yellow sands of the spaceport stretched, 
glaring and empty, in every direction. There was no 
sign of life from the little group of buildings a mile away. 

In the control room of the tall, round-nosed starship, 
technicians labored and officers conferred while the red 
needles that showed rocket tube temperatures sank slowly 
toward zero on their dials. 




66 



T he people of Earth had every means of power at their com- 



mand, yet they used none of it. Was it due to lack of knowledge 



and technique; or was there a more subtle, dangerous reason? 



“Maybe Earth’s depopulated, Tom,” suggested John Gray, 
the executive officer. He ran his fingers through close- 
cropped red hair and peered through the port with thought- 
ful gray eyes. 

“Hardly, John,” replied Commander Tom Wallace, frown- 
ing. “The scout rockets showed some good-sized cities, 
with smoke.” 



Illustrated by Paul Orban 




*‘I was off duty then and haven’t 
had time to read the log,” apolo- 
gized John. “What gets me is that 
they should have a robot-controlled 
space relay station orbiting outside 
the atmosphere, and a deserted 
spaceport. It just doesn’t jibe.” 

“That’s why we have to be just 
as careful as though we were land- 
ing on an alien planet,” said the 
commander. “We don’t know what 
the conditions on Earth are now. 
How long has it been, John?” 

“Two hundred and fifty-eight 
years,” answered John. “Ten years, 
our time.” 

“Pick three for briefing, John. 
This is going to be a disappointing 
homecoming for the crew, but we’ll 
liave to send out an exploration 
party.” 

The landing ramp slid out from 
just above the rocket tubes, and 
the armored car clanked down to 
the sand. John steered it across 
the wide expanse of the spaceport 
toward the group of buildings. 
Above and behind him, a woman 
swept the terrain with binoculars 
from the car’s observation turret. 
In the body of the car, another 
woman and a man stood by the 
guns. 

The buildings were just as life- 
less when they di'ew near, but there 
was an ominous atmosphere about 
them. They were windowless, of 
heavy concrete. Through slits in 
their domed roofs, the noses of a 
dozen cannon angled toward the 
ship. 

“John, there’s someone there,” 
said the girl in the turret, tensely. 
“You can’t see it through the wind- 
shield, but there are some smaller 

68 



guns poking out near the ground 
and they’re following us.” 

John stopped the car and 
sw'itched on the loudspeaker. 

“Hello, tlic spaceport!” His am- 
plified voice boomed out across the 
sand and reverberated against the 
buildings. “Is anybody there? We 
come in peace.” 

There was no reply. The big guns 
still angled toward the starship, the 
little ones focussed on tlie car. 

“They may be robot-controlled,” 
suggested Phil Maxwell, the gun- 
ner on the side of the car toward 
the forts. “Any sign of an entrance, 
Ann?” 

“Nothing but the gunports,” re- 
plied the girl in the turret. 

“Don’t fool with them, John,” 
said Commander Wallace, who was 
tuned in from the ship on the car’s 
communications system. “If they’re 
robot-controlled, they’ll be booby- 
trapped. Move out of range and 
continue with your exploration.” 

Two days later, the car emerged 
from the desert into comparatively 
fertile country. The four explorers 
found a broken concrete highway 
and followed it between rolling, 
treeless grasslands. Near dusk, they 
saw smoke on the horizon — and 
ran into a roadblock. 

A segment of the highway had 
been thrown up into a ten-foot 
wall, barring their progress. Over 
the edge of the wall, the muzzles of 
heat-guns pointed at them as they 
brought the car to a halt some 
distance away. John got the com- 
mander on the car radio. 

“We could swing around it, but 
we don’t know whether they have 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




vehicles that could outrun us,” he 
reported. “And my conception of 
our mission is to establish contact.” 

“That’s right,” agreed Tom. “But 
stay in the car until you get a 
friendly reaction. Then you’re on 
your own — and I’m afraid you’re 
expendable, John.” 

John switched on the loudspeaker 
and made overtures to the road- 
block. After a moment, a lone figure 
stepped around the edge of the 
mound of earth and concrete and 
approached the car slowly. The 
man was dressed in the drab, baggy 
uniform of a professional soldier. 

“If you come in peace, leave your 
vehicle and identify yourself,” 
called the soldier. “You will not 
be harmed.” 

“Take over, Phil,” ordered John. 
He slipped from the driver’s seat 
and climbed through the turret. 
Jumping to the ground, he ap- 
proached the soldier, his arms 
swinging freely at his sides. 

“John Gray, executive officer of 
the starship Discovery, returned 
from a colonizing mission to Deneb 
III,” said John, holding out his 
hand. 

The soldier ignored the out- 
stretched hand, saluting formally 
instead. 

“Arrive in peace,” he said. “If 
you will leave your vehicle here, 
you will be escorted as deevs to 
Third Sarge Elfor, commander of 
the town of Pebbro.” 

John returned to the car and 
held a brief consultation with his 
companions. Although he was in 
command of the exploration party, 
planetary operations of the star- 
ship’s personnel were conducted on 

CONSERVATION 



a somewhat democratic basis. The 
commander listened in, but left 
them to their own judgment. 

“Communications blackout for a 
while then, commander,” said 
John. “I see no reason to let them 
know about the personal radios 
right now.” 

The quartet emerged from the 
car wearing small packs of emer- 
gency rations and equipment. Be- 
hind the roadblock, the sight that 
met their eyes was unexpected. 

The robot-controlled space relay 
station, the heavily armed pillboxes 
at the spaceport and the heat-guns 
poked across the roadblock at them, 
all had made it logical to anticipate 
a powerfully equipped task force. 
Instead, they found a troop of 19th 
century cavalrymen, armed for the 
most part with 13th century weap- 
ons. There were no more than a 
dozen heat-guns in evidence, and 
their bearers also carried short 
swords and long-bows with quivers 
of arrows. 

The four from the starship were 
given mounts and, with no out- 
ward indications of hostility, were 
escorted to the town whose smoke 
they had seen. 

The town was another surprise. 
They had expected either a fortress 
or an outpost of brick and log 
buildings. It was neither. The 
buildings were tremendous cubes 
and domes of steel and concrete, 
sleek and modern, windowed with 
heavy glass bricks. Skeins of cables, 
coils and loops of aerials bespoke 
the power that must be at their 
command. 

But the people walked 

Not a car or a truck was to be 

69 




seen. Men and women in the gray 
military uniforms walked or trotted 
up and down the broad paved 
streets. Occasionally a horse-drawn 
wagon passed, hauling a load of 
vegetables or manure. It was as 
though a cavalry post of the old 
West carried on its slow-moving 
duties in a super-modem setting. 

HIRD SARGE ELFOR was a 
middle-aged man of military 
bearing, with a sandy handle-bar 
mustache. He sat behind a huge 
desk in one of the town’s biggest 
buildings. There were elevators, 
open and deserted, in the lobby, but 
they had to climb ten flights of 
stairs to reach his gleaming office. 

“The Topkick sends you greet- 
ings from Kansity, capital of the 
Earth,” he said. “We have watched 
your ship since it approached the 
outer atmosphere. We have listened 
to your communications since you 
left your ship, and have been in- 
terested in the indications that you 
are of Earth but unfamiliar with 
it. We are interested also in your 
use of a vehicle that can travel 
for three days without refueling. 
But we do not find a record of any 
ship named Discovery, and we do 
not know what you mean by Deneb 
III.” 

“The Discovery left Earth 258 
years ago,” repli^ John. “We es- 
tablished a colony on Deneb III, 
the third planet of the star Deneb, 
before returning to Earth.” 

“You are the descendents of the 
ship’s original crew, then?” 

“No,” said John. He explained 
as well as he could the extension of 

70 



subjective time at near-light speeds. 

“Mmm. And you have left a 
colony on a planet of another star.” 
They could not tell from tlie Third 
Sarge’s tone what he tliought. After 
a moment’s meditation, he said: 

“We shall talk again tomorrow. 
Tonight you are our guests and 
will be accorded all courtesy as 
deevs. Are you husbands and wives, 
or shall we billet men and women 
separately?” 

“However it suits your conven- 
ience,” answered John. “You may 
billet us all together if you prefer.” 

Third Sarge Elfor took them at 
their word. They were conducted to 
a single room, evidently in the heart 
of officers’ quarters. Here again 
they ran into the same anomaly 
that had impressed them since they 
landed. 

There were gleaming electric fix- 
tures, but orderlies brought them 
tallow candles as dusk fell. There 
was plumbing of the most ad- 
vanced order, but when they turned 
the taps no water came. The order- 
lies brought buckets full of hot 
water for their baths in the bright- 
tiled tub. 

“I don’t understand this at all, 
Ann,” said John. He was towelling 
himself vigorously, while she 
brushed the quartet’s clothing clean 
of the dust of the road. Phil lolled 
in luxurious undress on one of the 
four beds, reading a book from the 
well-stocked bookcase. Fran, pre- 
paring for her bath, was binding up 
her hair before a full-length mirror. 
“Even the cold water doesn’t run 
a drop.” 

“Plumbing gets out of order in 
the best of families, John,” Ann re- 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 





minded him with a smile. 

He glanced affectionately at her. 
Blue-eyed, black-haired Ann had 
been John’s companion in the six- 
months exploration of Deneb III, 
and their seven-year-old son now 
was learning to read in the star- 
ship’s school. John and Ann clashed 
like flint and steel in the crowded 
confines of the starship and conse- 
quently maintained no association 
while aspace. But they were a happy 
team in the free, challenging at- 
mosphere of a planet. 

“Electricity, too, at the same 
time?” he asked. “And it’s not just 
that. The whole place reeks of 
latent power and high science, but 
they use an absolute minimum of 
it.” 

“I’ve got a partial solution to the 
garrison state of affairs and the 
military set-up, anyhow,” said Phil 
from the bed. “They’ve had a war 
since we’ve been gone.” 

“That’s no surprise,” commented 
Fran. Chubby, blonde Fran and 
dark, stocky Phil had been compan- 
ions for a year aboard the Dis- 
covery. They had volunteered 
jointly for the exploration mission. 
“They should have had several of 
them in 250 years.” 

“This was an interplanetary 
war,” retorted Phil mildly. “Or 
rather, it wasn’t war, but occupa- 
tion of the Earth by the enemy. 
The Jovians were smart enough 
not to attack Earth directly, but 
threw their strength at the crucial 
moment behind the weaker side in 
the war between Eurasia and the 
American Alliance. Then they 
moved in to take over the war- 
weakened victors.” 



“The classic role of the strong 
neutral,” commented John drily. 
“What were the Jovians like?” 
“Evidently everybody on Earth 
knew from first-hand experience 
when this book was written a cen- 
tury ago. There are no descriptions 
and no illustrations. There are some 
hints, though : methane-breathing, 
cold-loving. They had domed, re- 
frigerated cities.” 

“What are you reading — a his- 
tory book?” asked Ann curiously. 

“Yes, it’s the newest book of the 
whole lot, and the only one that 
isn’t brittle and dog-eared. At that, 
it’s the worst-made book of them 
all. It looks like it was printed on 
a hand-press and bound by hand.” 
“Pioneers, oh pioneers!” trilled 
Fran softly. “But what are they 
doing in the midst of all this tech- 
nology?” 

Supper in the officers’ mess was 
a glittering affair in the military 
tradition. Their conversation devel- 
oped some new revelations. Third 
Sarge Elfor was commander of the 
whole area that surrounded Pebbro 
for hundreds of miles, including the 
abandoned spaceport. The Topkick 
was ruler of the nation, and the 
nation was the top echelon in a 
co-operating hierarchy of countries 
of the world. For some reason, the 
simplified terms for enlisted men’s 
grades had replaced higher ranks 
in Earth’s military systems: such 
titles as “sarge” and “topkick.” In- 
quiry developed that none of the 
officers was familiar with such des- 
ignations as “captain” and “com- 
mander.” 

“But why is the spaceport de- 



CONSERVATION 



71 




seited?” asked Phil. “Is space travel 
at such a low ebb on Earth now?” 
“You are mistaken in thinking 
the port deserted,” replied Elf or. 
“The big guns in the pillboxes are 
zeroed on your ship. If it tries to 
blast off, it will be destroyed.” 
There was no enmity in his tone, 
no threat. It was a simple state- 
ment of fact. He didn’t elaborate, 
and the four from the starship 
discreetly asked no more about it. 

After the meal, they retired with 
Elfor and several members of his 
staff to a quiet lounge. Like every 
other place they had seen in the 
building, it was lit with candelabra. 
They relaxed in comfortable, leath- 
er-covered chairs and the men 
enjoyed the long-forgotten luxury 
of good cigars. White-aproned ser- 
vitors brought them wine in fragile, 
long-stemmed glasses. 

“You asked about space travel 
from Earth,” said Elfor. “Yes, you 
might call it at a low ebb. Yours 
is the first ship to blast down in 
fifty years, except the scout ships 
in the Jupiter sector. 

“It is such an unusual occur- 
rence that the Topkick is being in- 
formed daily of developments. 
When the men of your starship 
have been assured of our peaceful 
intentions, it will be hangared un- 
derground and the personnel quar- 
tered here until further orders from 
the Topkick. Meanwhile, you are 
the deevs of the hour and we shall 
drink to your return to Earth.” 

He stood and raised his glass.' 
They all arose. The glasses clinked 
together. 

“Conserve!” shouted the Third 
Sarge and gulped his wine. 

72 



It was a warm moment. For the 
first time, John felt the genuine 
glow, the thrill of homecoming, as 
he and Phil drained their glasses 
and performed the ancient rite of 
the spacemen when he sets foot on 
Earth once more. As in one motion, 
they hurled the empty glasses 
through the open door, to smash 
to pieces against the farther wall of 
the adjoining corridor. There was 
a second crashing tinkle on the 
heels of the first as the glasses of 
the women followed them closely. 

It was only when he turned back 
to Elfor, his face alight, that John 
realized something was wrong. The 
Third Sarge stood with his mouth 
open in astonishment. There was 
something of horror on the faces 
of the other Earthmen. Dead silence 
hung in the room. 

“Sleep in peace,” said Elfor at 
last, in a strained voice. He turned 
on his heel and left the room. The 
staff members followed, coldly. 

“Well, what do you make of 
that?” asked John, turning to the 
others with outspread hands. “Do 
you suppose those glasses were val- 
uable heirlooms or something?” 

“They looked like ordinary wine- 
glasses to me,” said Fran. “I don’t 
get it, but it looks like we slipped 
up somewhere.” 

The orderly who escorted them to 
their room cast an occasional side- 
long glance, full of awe, at them. 
Their heat-guns had been taken 
from their room. 

“I don’t know what we’re in for, 
Tom,” John said gravely into his 
pocket transmitter when he had 
tuned in to the ship. “This place 
is the biggest mess of contradic- 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




tions I ever ran into. You’d think 
from the way they live that it’s a 
decadent society living on the ruins 
of a former civilization. 

“The perplexing thing is that 
they obviously have power and 
know how to use it, but don’t.” 

“Your job is to find the motiva- 
tion, John,” replied the commander. 
“Remember, we couldn’t under- 
stand the underground living habits 
of the Deneb IV natives until we 
lost half a search party in one of 
their semi-annual meteor showers. 
Do you have any recommendations 
for the ship?” 

“I’d advise you blasting off and 
taking an orbit,” answered John, 
“but every gun at the spaceport is 
trained on the ship. I wouldn’t 
take any chances that they don’t 
have atomic weapons. Despite these 
swords and spears, we’ve seen sev- 
eral regulation heat-guns around 
here.” 

“It might interest you to know 
that they’re keeping us awake 
aboard with a battery of spotlights 
on us all night,” said Tom drily. 

“Spotlights.” John swore softly. 
“And all we have to see by are 
candles!” 

They didn’t sleep well that night. 
They had the distinct impression 
that armed guards clanked by occa- 
sionally outside in the corridor. 

T here was no indication 

that they were prisoners the 
next day, however. Third Sarge 
Elfor and the other officers were 
cordial at breakfast and lunch, al- 
though they caught some quizzical 
glances directed at them from time 



to time. Their movements were not 
hampered. They were given the 
run of the town. 

After noon their armored car was 
brought in, hauled by four teams 
of horses. Flanked by a troop of 
soldiers, it was pulled around a 
corner and vanished from their 
sight. 

“If they’re so curious about how 
it runs, why aren’t they quizzing 
us instead of letting us go on a 
sight-seeing tour?” wondered Ann, 
staring after the disappearing ve- 
hicle. 

“I’ve built up a theory on these 
Earthmen . .” began Phil. But 
he was interrupted as an officer 
and a squad of soldiers approached 
them. The officer saluted smartly. 

“Deev John Gray, Third Sarge 
Elfor sends greetings and desires 
that you confer with him. The 
others will be free to continue their 
inspection of the military city of 
Pebbro.” 

“Very well,” agreed John. “Ann, 
you’d better come along with me 
to take notes on the conference. 
We’ll see you two tonight, if not 
sooner.” 

He motioned to the officer to 
lead the way, and the group went 
up the street, leaving Phil and Fran 
standing in the shadow of a tower- 
ing building. 

“What’s your theory, Phil?” 
asked Fran. 

“Simple,” he answered. “The 
Jovian war wiped out civilization. 
They’ve just climbed back up part 
of the way, but they still don’t know 
how to operate the machinery and 
use the power they have available.” 

“I don’t know about that,” said 



CONSERVATION 



73 




Fran doubtfully. “They seem to 
know how to handle those cannon 
and searchlights at the spaceport 
all right.” 

“Automatic control, probably, or 
— ” Phil paused. He was peering 
through a barred window at street 
level. “Say, Fran, look here! Un- 
less I miss my guess, this is a central 
power station!” 

Fran stooped to look. 

“I think you’re right,” she said. 
“But it’s deserted.” 

“Proof of my theory,” he said 
triumphantly. “Now, if we can just 
find a door somewhere . 

John and Ann had been back 
from a very routine conference with 
Elfor for more than an hour, and 
were enjoying the informality of 
the officers’ cocktail lounge in their 
building. They were aroused by a 
commotion in the street outside 
and, along with several off-duty 
officers in the lounge, ran to the 
window to see what was up. 

Phil and Fran, seated in a mili- 
tary jeep, were surrounded by ex- 
cited soldiers. Some sort of argu- 
ment was in progress, and John 
and Ann heard the word “creden- 
tials” mentioned. 

Just as several of the soldiers, 
with drawn swords, dragged the 
couple from the jeep, one of the 
officers from the lounge hurried to 
the scene. The soldiers stood aside 
and saluted. There was a heated 
discussion, with much gesticulating, 
then Phil and Fran were released 
and headed for the lounge. 

The officer got into the jeep and 
shifted gears. All the soldiers 
whipped out their swords and stood 

74 



rigid, presenting arms, as he drove 
it to the curb at the opposite side 
of the street. Then he turned off 
the engine and got out. A guard 
was posted around it, and a little 
later a team of horses arrived to 
pull it away. 

“How did you people get into 
such a predicament?” asked John 
when the show was over and the 
four of them were enjoying drinks. 

“Oh, I don’t think it was as 
serious as it looked,” said Phil 
lightly. “We ran across a whole 
garage full of jeeps. We drove that 
one all over town before this gang 
stopped us and wanted to see our 
written authority for driving it. 
Everybody else saluted us. That’s 
the military mind for you.” 

“Didn’t it occur to you that their 
objections might be something 
other than mere military regula- 
tions?” asked John in some asperity. 

“Phil has a theory — ” began 
Fran, but Phil silenced her with a 
shake of the head. 

“My theory can wait until I have 
proof for it, and I expect that in 
short order,” said Phil, winking at 
Fran. “We’ve made good use of our 
time while you and Ann were in 
conference.” 

Phil and Fran were eager to 
know what John and Ann had 
learned from their conference with 
Elfor. 

“Not much,” he confessed. “Elfor 
is pretty close-mouthed. He’s more 
anxious to learn about us than to 
give us information about their set- 
up. 

“We did find out, though, that 
they’ve located the records of the 
Discovery’s departure in the ar- 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




chives of Kansity. There seems to 
be something irregular about it, but 
I couldn’t get Elfor to go into de- 
tail.” 

The first hint John and Ann had 
of Phil’s method of proving his 
theory was when he quietly stripped 
and went into the bathroom as they 
were preparing for supper that 
evening. Ann was about to remind 
him he had forgotten to get the 
orderly to bring his bath water, 
when they heard the sound of a 
shower roaring. All three crowded 
to the door, to find Phil luxuriating 
under a steaming downpour. 

“What goes on here?” demanded 
John. “Phil, how did you know 
they’d started the water pumps?” 

Phil smiled triumphantly. 

“Try the lights,” he suggested. 

The others trooped back into the 
bedroom and Ann flicked the 
switches. White light blazed in the 
room, overpowering the feeble 
gleam of the candles. 

“What is this, Fran?” asked 
John. “You were with Phil.” 

“We found proof of Phil’s theory 
that these people just don’t know 
how to operate their own ma- 
chinery,” replied Fran happily. “We 
found their main pumping station. 
It was in good shape, and it didn’t 
take us long to get the engines 
started and the main switches 
thrown.” 

The electric lights suddenly faded 
and died, leaving them in candle- 
light again. At the same time, the 
sound of the shower gurgled to a 
stop in the bathroom. Phil ap- 
peared at the door with a towel, 
dripping. 

“Don’t tell me their machinery’s 



given out so soon,” he growled. 

“Phil, this is no time to talk about 
discipline,” snapped John angrily, 
“but you and Fran probably have 
pulled something a lot worse than 
the jeep this time. Neither of you 
is qualified in social psychology, but 
even so you should have been able 
to read the signs that they do know 
how to operate thefi machines. For 
some reason, they just don’t operate 
them.” 

In less than five minutes. Third 
Sarge Elfor appeared at their door 
with a squad of armed men. All of 
these soldiers carried heat-guns. 

“Two of you were observed in the 
vicinity of the power station today,” 
said Elfor. “You are warned that 
you are suspected of having acti- 
vated the power supply of the 
military city of Pebbro.” 

“We don’t deny that,” admitted 
John carefully. “We are ignorant 
of your customs, and hope no harm 
has been done.” 

“Your claim to ignorance will be 
determined at a formal hearing,” 
retorted Elfor sternly. “We have 
given you the benefit of every doubt 
and treated you as honored deevs. 
I regret that this makes it necessary 
that all of you be placed under 
arrest. Your meal will be served to 
you in your quarters.” 

As soon as Elfor had gone, 
leaving armed guards outside their 
door, John tuned in the starship on 
his pocket transmitter. 

“I would have advised against 
Phil’s action, in view of our lack 
of understanding of the situation,” 
he reported to Commander Wal- 
lace. “But I confess I wouldn’t have 
anticipated that the result would 



CONSERVATION 



75 




be so extreme. 

“I can’t fathom their reactions, 
Tom. In a crazy sort of way, I 
suppose they fit in with all the 
other contradictions of their social 
set-up. Have you had any luck witli 
the ship’s calculator?” 

“Not enough data,” answered 
Tom. “Maybe this new stuff will 
help, and you might scrape for 
everything else you can transmit. 
I’d hate to try a rescue operation, 
because that might force us to head 
back for Deneb III. But if they 
don’t decide to blast the ship in the 
next hour or so, there’s a chance 
we can pull out of this trap at our 
end.” 

John did not ask for details, for 
he knew their conversation probably 
was monitored. 



T he four of them sat up 
half the night poring over the 
books in their room. They gleaned 
nothing except from the “history” 
Phil had been reading the night 
before. Unfortunately, it was not a 
general history, but the flowery 
story of a high military family. The 
sort of references they found were, 
“after the Jovian invaders had been 
driven from Earth” and “Second 
Sarge Vesix participated in the 
bombardment that destroyed the 
Jovian tyrants.” No details. 

What did emerge from their 
study was a picture of the rise of a 
military aristocracy on the ashes 
of an earlier civilization which had 
been ground to pieces under the 
heels of alien rulers. 

There was good news from the 
starship at dawn. 

76 



“We’re orbiting,” said Comman- 
der Wallace with quiet pride. 
“Shortly after I talked with you last 
night, they called on us to surrender 
or be blasted. I asked time for a 
conference of officers and promised 
to fire a rocket from the nose if 
we decided to surrender. 

“I fired the rocket all right, but 
it was an instantaneous smoke 
screen rocket. I still don’t know 
whether their guns are manned or 
robot-controlled, but I gambled 
that their firing was keyed to the 
sight of the ship blasting off in- 
stead of to vibration. We were half 
a mile up before they could swing 
into action, and we didn’t get a 
scratch.” 

A rescue mission with one of the 
scout rockets was too risky against 
the strong forces of the Earthmen. 
Tom mentioned that fast planes 
had followed them into the strato- 
sphere. But one thing was done for 
the imprisoned four. 

Soon after breakfast, they were 
taken under guard to a Spartan 
courtroom, presided over by Third 
Sarge Elfor. 

“We have received a warning 
from your colleagues,” Elfor said 
grimly. “They broadcast to us a 
short time ago that if harm came 
to you, this city and others will be 
destroyed before they leave the 
solar system. In case you knew of 
this and it has in any way raised 
your hopes, I wish to remind you 
that Earth’s cities have been de- 
stroyed before. This threat will not 
affect our decision to mete strict 
justice to you. 

“You are charged with being 
enemies of the people of Earth, 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




and with having landed on Earth 
under false colors with the intent 
of sabotage and espionage. Your 
prosecutor will be Fifth Tech Jatoo, 
representing the nations of Earth. 
You will be permitted to speak in 
your own defense.” 

Jatoo was a slender, thin-faced 
man with the air of an experienced 
attorney. 

“The governments of Earth 
make these charges against the joint 
defendants,” he began matter-of- 
factly: “That they are members 
of a rebellious and traitorous group 
who are allied with the Jovians and 
maintain an illegal, secret base on 
some planet or moon of the solar 
system; that they came here under 
the guise of strangers, with the 
specific intent of espionage and 
sabotage of Earth’s defense against 
the Jovian enemy; and that they 
actually began such operations. 

“We shall present the following 
major evidence in support of these 
charges : 

“First, that the defendants did 
travel from the Numex spaceport 
to the military town of Pebbro in a 
vehicle, the motive power of which 
is still unknown but which obviously 
must utilize fuel, in violation of the 
conservation laws; 

“Second, that the defendants’ 
colleagues did not approach the 
peoples of Earth in peace, but re- 
mained enfortressed in an armed 
space vessel; 

“Third, that the defendants Phil 
Alcorn and Fran Golden did throw 
the switches activating the electrical 
system and powered water system 
of the military town of Pebbro, that 
the above-named two defendants 



did utilize a military power vehicle 
for pleasure purposes and that all 
the defendants did unnecessarily 
destroy glass drinking vessels, all in 
violation of the conservation laws; 

“And, fourth, that the starship 
Discovery, listed in ancient records 
as having departed on a colonizing 
mission to the third planet of the 
star Deneb, was not scheduled to 
return to Earth for another seventy- 
five years and therefore could not 
be the ship in which the defendants 
arrived, as claimed.” 

Elfor inclined his head toward 
the quartet from the starship, who 
sat behind a long table on the side 
of the room opposite Jatoo. 

“You may state what your de- 
fense will be,” he said. 

“Our defense to the first three 
items of evidence,” answered John, 
who had been taking notes, “is that 
we have been absent from Earth 
for more than 250 Earth-years and 
that we were, and are, ignorant of 
your laws and customs. Thus, we 
are innocent of intent to violate 
them. Our defense to the fourth 
item of evidence is that certain im- 
provements were made in the en- 
gines of the starship Discovery 
while colonization of Deneb III 
was in progress, making it pos- 
sible for us to return to Earth ahead 
of schedule. Our defense to all three 
charges made against us is that they 
are false.” 

It was a monotonous trial, with a 
parade of witnesses brought to the 
stand by Jatoo, all of whom testified 
lo seeing the defendants perform 
one or more acts of “unconserva- 
tion.” 

“In the courts of Earth, a case 

77 



CONSERVATION 




can be decided only on the evidence 
presented,” said Third Sarge Elfor 
when John had offered his brief de- 
fense for the quartet. “The defend- 
ants have presented no evidence, 
only argumeht. The fact that the 
defendants’ clothing corresponds to 
that in use two and a half centuries 
ago cannot be considered com- 
petent, as it could be copied easily. 

“For the safety of Earth, the de- 
fendants are found guilty and re- 
manded for immediate execution. 
In view of the existence of doubt as 
to their treasonable intent and their 
previous status as deevs, they are 
accorded the honor of death by 
power weapons. Conserve!” 

Shocked and silent, the four were 
led to a courtyard outside. As they 
walked, John switched on his 
pocket transmitter with a casual, 
almost unnoticeable gesture, and 
murmured a report to the ship. 

“I’m sorry, John,” said the com- 
mander, his voice tense with emo- 
tion. “There’s no possibility of res- 
cue, and I know it’s small satisfac- 
tion to you that your deaths will be 
avenged.” 

The quartet’s hands were bound 
behind them and they were lined 
up against a wall. The Third Sarge, 
attended by a good-sized retinue, 
stood at ease nearby, smoking a 
cigar, to direct the execution per- 
sonally. 

“ ‘Power weapons’ to them ap- 
parently mean regulation heat- 
guns,” remarked Phil, almost jocu- 
larly. “That’s what the fellow has.” 

A soldier was standing square in 
the center of the courtyard, a pistol 
dangling from his grip. At a signal 

78 



from Elfor, he lifted it. 

“Looks like I’m first,” said 
John, bracing himself. “Be seeing 
you, somewhere.” 

He gritted his teeth for the wave 
of unbearable heat that was sure to 
come. Instead, there was a silent 
explosion in the midst of the court- 
yard and the soldier who had held 
the gun writhed on the ground, in- 
cinerated. 

“John! The gun exploded!” cried 
Phil in amazement. “I’ve only seen 
that happen once before! — Re- 
member that crewman who 
wouldn’t take the trouble to keep 
his gun clean?” 

John was thinking fast. 

“I remember,” he said in a low 
voice. His heart was still racing 
from the reaction of his near brush 
with death. “There’s a pattern here. 
If I could only get a chance to talk 
over things sensibly with this Third 
Sarge . .” 

There was great excitement 
among the soldiery. Several of the 
men were crowded around the 
corpse of the marksman. Elfor stood 
nervously, his hand on his own bol- 
stered gun. 

“They’re concealing weapons,” 
he barked to his aides. “Search 
them!” 

A squad of guards swarmed over 
the four prisoners. There was an 
excited twitter when they discov- 
ered the pocket transmitters. They 
removed the little packets, snapping 
the aerial wires, and carried them 
to Elfor. He glanced at them, took 
one in his hand, and ordered: 

“Execute them!” 

Another guard with a heat-gun 
took his position in the center of the 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




courtyard. He handled the weapon 
somewhat gingerly, but checked its 
mechanism and prepared to follow 
orders. 

He waited for the command from 
Elfor. But the Third Sarge now was 
staring hard at the little transmitter 
in his hand. Instead of ordering the 
guard to fire, he strode across the 
courtyard and thrust the tiny radio 
before John’s face. 

“Is this true?” he demanded. He 
pointed at the well-known symbol 
stamped on the packet, the red 
diagram of an atom that warned 
against opening the lead-shielded 
mechanism without precaution. 

“You mean, is it atomic-pow- 
ered?” asked John. “Yes it is.” 

“It is a weapon?” 

“No, it’s a radio transmitter.” 
“But it operates?” 

“Certainly it operates. Why in 
thunder do you think I’d be carry- 
ing a useless transmitter?” 

“It has been many years since 
this sign was seen on a working 
mechanism on Earth,” said Elfor 
soberly. “You are familiar, then, 
with atomic power?” 

“I’m not an atomic technician,” 
answered John carefully, “but there 
are several on the Discovery who 
can build anything from one of 
these little transmitters to the en- 
gines of a spaceship, with the 
proper equipment.” 

The Third Sarge stood in silent 
thought for several minutes. He was 
high in the councils of his country, 
or he would not have been com- 
mander of the zone that guarded 
Numex spaceport. He knew the rea- 
son for the basic slogan “Conserve!” 
and he knew, as 99 per cent of his 



subordinates did not, what circum- 
stances would make that slogan 
meaningless. 

“Guard!” he growled. “Unbind 
the dee vs! John Gray, come with 
me in peace.” 

“You’d better give me back that 
transmitter, first,” suggested John 
drily. “I’d hate to escape execution 
just to get H-bombed by my own 
ship.” 

It was the next afternoon that 
the four were escorted by a trim- 
uniformed guard of honor across 
the flat spaceport to the Discovery. 

“The Jovians wanted to reduce 
Earth to colonial status, to be ex- 
ploited for its natural resources,” 
John explained to his companions 
as they walked. “All atomic installa- 
tions were destroyed, all technicians 
and scientists exterminated system- 
atically and all scientific books 
burned. They were very thorough 
about it. 

“The successful revolt was ac- 
complished with a concealed stock- 
pile of atomic weapons. Since that 
time, they’ve been garrisoned 
against the return of the Jovians. 
But atomic power was gone and so 
were the scientists who could bring 
it back and the books from which 
new scientists could learn. 

“It’s because they can’t replace 
even so small a thing as an electric 
light bulb that destruction or un- 
necessary use of any sort of equip- 
ment is the rankest sort of treason. 
They’ve been saving all their tech- 
nological capital for a last-ditch 
stand against the expected invasion.

TO SIRIUS 



Carman should have known better. Tilting at windmills is a 
most unrewarding affair — you just can’t win . 



BY ROBERT SILVERBERG 




81 



C ONSUMER SIXTH Class 
David Carman watched the 
yellow snake that was the morning 
telefax sheet come rippling from the 
wall slot of his bachelor flat. The 
folds of plastic-impregnated tape 
slithered into the receiving tray, and 
Carman surveyed them glumly. He 
knew there would only be more bad 
news — more tales of defeat in the 
Sirian war, more heralding of price 
increases on the consumer front. 

After a moment of hesitation 
Carman gathered up the telefax 
spool and slipped it into the scan- 
ner-reader. He shuddered as the 
first news appeared on the screen. 

COSTLY SETBACK IN SIRIUS 
War Sector, 14 Nov (via sub- 



radio) — A Sirian pitchfork ma- 
neuver hurled Earth lines back 
today in the battle for Sirius IV. 
The sudden alien thrust cost 
Earth eight destroyers and more 
than a hundred casualties. 

The push began, according to 
a front-lines communique, when 
eleven Sirian battle cruisers initi- 
ated diversionary tactics in orbit 
around the Earth base on Sirius 
IV’s seventh moon. Bringing in 
a battalion of mosquito-ships 
next, the aliens successfully — 

Morosely Carman thumbed his 
weary eyes and moved the scanner 
further along. All these war stories 
were pretty much alike, he thought. 
And the telefax revelled in detailed 
descriptions of each ofTensK'e and 




defensive tactic. Carman knew 
nothing of war-making; the details 
bored him. 

But the next item was hardly 
more cheering. 

PRICE INDEX TO JUMP AGAIN 
Lower Urb-district, 16 Nov^ — 
Consumer prices are due for an- 
other increase-spiral as a result of 
the severe setback suffered by 
Terran forces in the Sirian sec- 
tor. Economic Regulator Harri- 
son Morch revealed this morning 
that a down-the-line 5% in- 
crease is likely. 

“We tried to hold the line,” 
commented Regulator Morch. 
“The inflationary trend was too 
strong to buck, however. It is to 
be hoped that conclusion of hos- 
tilities will soon bring about a 
reversion to peacetime living 
standards and — ” 

With an angry, impatient ges- 
ture, Carman blanked the screen. 
There was little sense spending good 
money subscribing to the ’fax serv- 
ice if it only brought bad news. 

Things hadn’t been this bad a 
year ago, before the war started, he 
thought, as he dialed breakfast and 
took his seat by the dispensall. He 
had even been thinking of applying 
for a marriage permit, then. Now, 
of course, it was out of the question ; 
his economic status was totally al- 
tered. And Sally, who worked for 
the Bureau of Extraterrestrial Af- 
fairs, had received a pay-boost that 
put her entirely beyond Carman’s 
aspirations. She was Third Class, 
now, and would soon marry a 
wealthy Bureau official. 

82 



Carman broodingly munched his 
somewhat dry algae-omclet. He was 
thirty-three, and not getting young- 
er. He was too pale, too thin, his 
eyes too close-set, his hair growing 
sparse. And it seemed that when- 
ever he got some money saved and 
looked around to better his position, 
along came some war to send prices 
shooting up and cripple his savings. 
Five years ago there had been that 
thing in Procyon, and then a year 
or two of peace followed by a scuffle 
out near Proxima Centauri. And 
now Sirius. 

You can’t win, he thought. He 
finished breakfast mechanically, 
dropped the dishes in the disposall, 
and selected his second-best suit 
with a quick, bitter jab at the ward- 
robe control buttons. 

It came issuing forth: grey crepe, 
with dark blue trim. The jacket was 
getting tattered at the elbows. 

rd better buy a new suit. Car- 
man decided, as he stepped out on 
the pickup platform to hail a jet- 
cab. Before clothing prices get as- 
tronomical. 

He reached the office at 0700 
that morning, with dawn barely 
brightening the late autumn sky. 
Carman worked as a sorter in the 
permit-processing department of 
the Confederation Passp>ort Office, 
and so as a government employee 
had little recourse when the peri- 
odic inflation-spirals came ; he could 
hardly go on strike against the Con- 
federation. 

A good-sized batch of passport- 
applications had already accumu- 
lated at his receiving-tray. Carman 
slid easily into the seat, flashed 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 




bright but hollow smiles at the five 
or six fellow-workers nearest him, 
and grabbed at the top sheet of the 
stack. He estimated quickly that a 
hundred eighty applications had ar- 
rived so far. They would be pouring 
in at a rate of seven a minute the 
rest of the day. 

He computed: 

If I process one form every six 
seconds, ten a minute, Fll gain 
three per minute on them. Which 
means Fit catch up with them in 
about an hour. 

If he kept up the ten-a-minute 
pace, he’d be free to take short 
breathers later on. This was one of 
the games he played to make his 
dreary work more palatable. 

The first application was from 
Consumer Second Class Leebig D. 
Quellen and family ; Consumer Sec- 
ond Class Quellen wanted to visit 
the Ganymede outpost next sum- 
mer. Carman plunged the applica- 
tion into the bin stencil-labelled 14a 
with his left hand, and with his 
right took another from the waiting 
stack. Sort with the left, grab with 
the right; sort with the left, grab 
with the right. Carman swayed 
rhythmically in his seat as he fell 
into the pattern of the day’s work. 

After a while he began hitting 
them twelve to a minute, sometimes 
thirteen. By 0757 his tray was 
empty. He sighed. Eight seconds of 
free time, now, until the next per- 
mit reared its ugly head. 

Sort, grab . sort, grab ... it 
was dull but essentially simple work, 
in a mechanical way. It scarcely 
taxed his brain. But he was paid 
accordingly: $163 a week, barely a 
subsistence wage before the last 

PASSPORT TO SIRIUS 



spiral. And now — 

1030 came. Break-time. Carman 
stretched and rose, noticing angrily 
that the girl in the upstairs receiv- 
ing room had slipped three applica- 
tions in after break-time sounded. 
She was always pulling tricks like 
that. 

Carman had long since reduced 
break-time to a ritual. He crossed 
the office to the cleanall and held 
his hands in the energizing bath un- 
til his fingertips were wiped clean 
of their accumulation of stylus 
grime; then, he glanced out the 
single big window at the crowded 
city, turned, and smiled at Mon- 
tano, the heavy-set fellow who had 
occupied the next desk for the six 
years Carman had worked for the 
Passport Office. 

“Nice day,” Montano said. “For 
November.” 

“Yes.” 

“See the morning ’fax? Looks 
like another upping for prices.” 

Carman nodded unhappily. “I 
saw. Don’t know how we’ll man- 
age.” 

“Oh, we’ll get along. We always 
do. The wife’s due for a raise soon 
anyway.” Montano’s wife pushed 
buttons in a car autofactory. Some- 
how she seemed to be due for a 
raise almost every other week. 

“That’s nice,” Carman said. 

“Yeah.” 

“Does she think cars are going 
up?” 

“Damn right,” Montano said. 
“Ford-Chrysler’s boosting the stock 
model to six thousand next month. 
Need turbogenerators for the war 
effort, they say. We already got our 
order in at the old price. You better 

83 




buy fast if you want one, Carman. 
Save five hundred bucks now if 
you’re smart.” 

“I don’t need a new car,” Car- 
man said. 

“Better get anything you need 
now, anyway. Everything’s going 
up. Always does, wartime.” 

The bell-tone announced the end 
of break-time. Carman reached his 
desk just in time to see a passport 
application come fluttering down, 
followed seconds later by another. 

“Demons take that girl,” he mut- 
tered softly. She always cut her 
break short to plague him with 
extra work. Now she was six — no, 
seven — ahead of him. 

Justin C. Froelich and family, 
of Minnetonka, wished permission 
to visit Pluto next July. Wearily, 
Carman dropped Justin C. Froe- 
lich’s application in the proper bin, 
and reached for the next. 

He was seething inwardly, curs- 
ing the Passport Office, the girl 
upstairs, inflation. Economic Regu- 
lator Morch, and the world in gen- 
eral. It seemed to be a rat-race with 
no exit from the treadmill. 

Fve been pushed around too 
long, he thought. 1 ought to fight 
hack a little. Somehow. 

Consumer Sixth Class Carman 
was on the verge of changing the 
course of his life. An hour more 
passed, and 193 additional passport 
applications disappeared into bins. 
Finally, he made up his mind to act, 

HE RECRUITING officer was 
a spade-faced, dark-complected 
man with angular features and 
bright white teeth. He wore the 

84 



green-and-gold uniform of the 
United Military Services of Earth. 
He stared levelly across his shining 
bare desk at Carman and said, 
“Would you mind repeating that?” 
“I said I wanted to fight. Against 
Sirius.” 

The recruiting officer frowned 
ponderously. After a long pause he 
said, “I don’t see how I can guaran- 
tee that. We enroll you; the com- 
puter ships you out. Whether you 
get sent to the war zone or not de- 
pends on a variable complex of 
factors which certainly no civilian 
should be expected to understand.” 
He shoved a form across the desk 
toward Carman. “If you’ll fill this 
out, Mac, we can — ” 

“No,” Carman said. “I want a 
guarantee that I’ll see action in the 
Sirius sector. Dammit, Lieu- 
tenant — ” 

“Sergeant.” 

“ — Sergeant, I’m thirty-three. 
I’m as close to being nobody as any- 
body can get. If I’m lucky I’ll get 
as high as Third Class someday. I’ve 
saved ten thousand bucks, and I 
suppose the new inflation’s going to 
knock my savings in half the way 
the last one did.” 

“Mr. Cairoan, I don’t see how 
all this— ” 

“You will. For thirty-three years 
I’ve been sitting around on the 
home front going up and down with 
each economic spiral while Earth 
fights wars in Procyon and Proxima 
C and half a dozen other places. 
Fm tired of staying home. I want 
to enlist.” 

“Sure, Mac, but — ” 

“But I don’t want to enlist just to 
wear a uniform and police the 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 





frontiers on Betelgeuse. I want to go 
to Sirius, and I want to fight. Once 
in my life I want to engage in posi- 
tive action on behalf of a Cause.” 
Carman took a deep breath; he 
hadn’t spoken this many words in 
succession in a long, long time. “Do 
you understand now? Will you 
guarantee that I’ll be shipped to 
Sirius if I sign up?” 

The sergeant exhaled deeply, un- 
happily. “I’ve explained twice that 
the matter’s not in my hands. May- 
be I could attach a recommenda- 
tion — ” 

“A guarantee'' 

“But — ” A crafty light appeared 
in the recruiting sergeant’s eyes; he 
drummed the desktop momentarily 
and said, “You’re a very persistent 
man, Mac. You win; I’ll see you get 
assigned to the war zone. Now, why 
don’t you just sign your name 
here — ” 

Carman shook his head. “No, 
thanks. I just changed my mind.” 

Before the sergeant could protest, 
Carman had backed warily out of 
the office and was gone. It had 
abruptly occurred to him that a re- 
cruiting officer’s promise was not 
necessarily final. And there were 
more direct methods he could use 
to get into the war. 

He returned to the Passport 
Office at 1313, and the robot eye at 
the office door took note of it, click- 
ing loudly as he passed through. 
Ordinarily Carman would haye 
groaned at the loss of thirteen 
minutes’ pay, but, then, ordinarily 
he would have been at his desk 
promptly at 1300 anyway. 

Everyone else was busily at work ; 
heads bowed, hands groping madly 



for the incoming applications, his 
fellow sorters presented an oddly 
ludicrous sight. Carman resumed 
his place. Nearly a hundred waiting 
permits had stacked themselves in 
the receiving tray during his ab- 
sence — but this, too, hardly trou- 
bled him now. 

He went through them at a fran- 
tic pace, occasionally hitting as 
high as twenty per minute. Plenty 
of them were going to the wrong 
bins, he realized, but this was no 
time to worry about that. He caught 
up with the posting department in 
less than forty minutes, and made 
use of his first eight-second breather 
to draw a blank passport applica- 
tion from his desk drawer; he had 
always kept a few on hand there. 

He filled out the blank patiently, 
in eight-second bursts between each 
of the arrivals from above. Where 
it said Name and Status, he wrote 
Consumer Sixth Class David Car- 
man. Where it said. Intended Des- 
tination, he inscribed Sirius VII in 
tidy cursives. Sirius VII was outside 
the war zone, and so theoretically 
within reach of commercial traffic, 
but passports to anywhere in the 
Sirius system were granted only by 
special dispensation since the out- 
break of hostilities, and Carman 
knew he had small chance of re- 
ceiving such dispensation. 

Which was why, after the form 
was completely filled out, he 
thoughtfully scribbled an expert 
forgery of the Secretary of Extra- 
terrestrial Affairs’ signature on the 
bottom of the sheet, okaying the 
application. Humming gently, he 
dropped the completed blank into 
the bin labelled 82g and returned 



PASSPORT TO SIRIUS 



85 




his attention to the labors of the 
day. 

The passport took eight days to 
come through. Carman had some 
uneasy moments while waiting, 
though he was ultimately confident 
of success. After all, the workers 
who processed the sorted applica- 
tions and issued the passports prob- 
ably handled their work as mechan- 
ically and hastily as he did in the 
level above them — and he never 
had time to check for possible 
forgeries, so why should they? 
Never-ending cascades of passport 
applications descended on them ; 
probably they cursed him for work- 
ing so fast, just as he in turn 
scowled up the chute at the girl in 
the top level. 

Five seconds after the passport to 
Sirius dropped out of his mailchute. 
Carman was on the phone talking 
to the secretary of the Personnel 
Chief at the Passport Office. 

“Yes, I said Carman. David Car- 
man, Sixth Class. IVe enlisted in 
the Services and my resignation is 
eflfective today. Yes, today. My pay- 
check? Oh, burn it,” Carman said 
impatiently, and hung up. So much 
for past associations. 

Carman withdrew his entire sav- 
ings — $9,783.61. The roboteller 
handed the cash over without com- 
ment. Carman took the thick pile 
of crisp bills, counted slowly 
through them to the great annoy- 
ance of the people behind him in 
line, and nudged the acknowledge 
stud to let the teller know the trans- 
action was complete. Outside the 
bank, he signalled for another cop- 
ter and took it to the Upper Urb- 
district Spaceport, far out on what 

86 



had once been Long Island. 

“A ticket to Sirius?” the dispatch- 
er asked, after the robot ticket- 
vender had passed Carman on to 
him in perplexity. “But the war, 
you know — we’ve curtailed our 
service to that entire sector.” 

“I don’t care,” Carman said 
stolidly. He was growing accus- 
tomed to being forceful now; it 
came easily to him, and he enjoyed 
it. “You advertise through trans- 
portation to Sirius VII. I’ve got a 
passport that says I can go there, 
and I’ve got six thousand dollars to 
pay my way. Cash.” 

“This is very irregular,” moaned 
the dispatcher, a short harried-look- 
ing little man. “We discontinued 
passenger service to that system 
eight months ago, when — ” 

“You could lose your franchise 
for this,” Carman snapped bluntly. 
“Sirius VII is non-belligerent. I 
have money and a passport. I de- 
mand transportation.” 



I N THE END, they diverted a 
freight run bound for Deneb, and 
put Carman aboard with the prom- 
ise that they’d drop him at Sirius 
VII. His passport was in order, and 
he had the cash for the payment. 

The trip took three weeks of 
steady hyperdrive travel. Six other 
humans were on board, all bad- 
smelling crewmen, and the crew 
of a space-freighter is hardly pleas- 
ant company on a three-week jour- 
ney. Carman kept to himself, in- 
venting a form of solitaire he could 
play making use of hundred-dollar 
bills, of which he had more than 
thirty left even after paying passage. 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 




The ship’s cargo consisted of steers 
slated for an agrarian colony orbit- 
ing Deneb, and Carman lived in a 
cramped cabin just aft of the cargo 
hold. He got little sleep. 

They put him down finally on the 
concrete landing apron at Zuorf, 
crown-city of Sirius VII, on the 
fifth day of 2672, having first 
radioed the Terran consul there to 
let them know he was coming. Big- 
gest and muggiest of the twelve 
planets that circled the dog-star, 
Sirius VII was a vast mountainous 
world with ugly sprawling cities 
crammed between the jagged 
peaks; its people were brawny ur- 
sinoids, not long escaped from their 
neolithic culture-stage. 

As it happened, some sort of local 
celebration was in full sway when 
Carman, a solitary figure with a 
solitary suitcase of belongings, left 
the spaceport. Great heavy-set crea- 
tures were whirling up and down 
the streets in each other’s arms, 
looking like so many dancing-bears 
clad in tinsel and frills. Carman 
stepped hastily back into the shad- 
ow of a squat yellow-painted build- 
ing while a platoon of the huge 
shaggy aliens came thundering past, 
to the gay accompaniment of dis- 
tant tootling music composed in 
excruciating quarter-tone intervals. 

A hand fell lightly on his shoul- 
der. Carman turned and jumped 
away all in the same nervous mo- 
tion. He saw an Earthman behind 
him, clad in the somber black vest- 
ments of the Terran diplomatic 
corps. 

“Pardon me if I startled you,” 
the stranger said in a soft, cultured 
voice. He was a neatly-turned out, 

PASSPORT TO SIRIUS 



mildly foppish-looking man in his 
forties, with elegant features, well- 
groomed dark hair, delicately- 
shaven brow ridges. Only the 
startling brass ring through his nos- 
trils marred his otherwise distin- 
guished upper-class appearance. 

“I’m the Terran consul on this 
world,” he went on, in the same 
gentle tones. “Adrian Blyde’s my 
name. Am I right in assuming 
you’re the man who was just 
dropped off by that freighter?” 
“You are. I’m David Carman of 
Earth. Want to see my passport?” 
Consul Blyde smiled serenely. “In 
due time, Mr. Carman. I’m sure it’s 
in good order. But would you mind 
telling me precisely why you’ve 
come to Sirius VII?” 

“To join the amied forces. I 
want to take part in the Sirian 
campaign.” 

“To join the armed forces,” 
Blyde repeated in a faintly wonder- 
struck voice. “Well well well. That’s 
very interesting, Mr. Carman. Very. 
Would you come this way, please?” 
Blyde seized him firmly by the 
fleshy part of his arm and propelled 
him across the wide, poorly-paved 
street, between two pairs of madly 
careening bear-like beings, and into 
a narrow doorway in a building 
constructed of purple brick. 

“The autochthones are celebrat- 
ing their annual fertility festival to- 
day,” the Consul explained. “The 
couples dance through the city from 
morning to night without rest. 
Those that keep on their feet the 
whole day without collapsing are 
entitled to mate. The weak ones 
have to try again next year. It’s 
quite a neat genetic system, really.” 

87 




Carman glanced back through 
the doorway at the hordes of spin- 
ning aliens weaving wildly down 
the broad street, locked each to 
each in a desperate grip of love. 

“The nose-rings denote masculin- 
ity/’ Blyde said. “Terran males who 
stay here have to wear them too; 
the natives are very, very fussy 
about that. When in Rome, you 
know. I’ll give you yours tonight.” 
“Just a minute,” Carman said 
worriedly, as Blyde unlocked an 
office door and gestured within to 
a cluttered little room lined with 
booktapes and scattered papers. “I 
don’t plan to stay here, you know. 
The military action’s on Sirius IV. 
That’s where I’m going as soon as 
I’ve seen the authorities and en- 
listed.” 

Blyde dropped heavily into a 
well-upholstered pneumochair, 
wiped perspiration from his brow 
with an obviously scented cloth, 
and sighed unhappily. “My dear 
Mr. Carman: I don’t know what 
motives impelled you to come to 
this system, nor by what chicanery 
you wangled your passage. But, 
now that you’re here, there are 
several things you should know.” 
“Such as?” 

“For one, there are no hostilities 
currently taking place anywhere in 
the Sirius system.” 

Stunned, Carman gasped, “No — 
hostilities? Then the war’s over?” 
Blyde touched his fingertips 
lightly together. “You misunder- 
stand. There never was any war be- 
tween Earth and Sirius IV. Care 
for a drink?” 

“Rye,” Carman said automat- 
ically. “Never — ^was — a — war? But 

88 



— how — ” 

“Economic Regulator Harrison 
Morch of Earth is a great man,” 
Blyde said with seeming irrelevancy, 
putting his head back as if studying 
the reticulated pattern of paint- 
cracks on the office ceiling. An air 
conditioner hummed ineffectually 
somewhere. “Economic Regulator 
Morch has devoted a lifetime of 
study to examining the motives 
governing fluctuations in economic 
trends.” 

Carman’s throat felt terribly dry. 
The moist warmth of Sirius VII’s 
atmosphere, the additional drag of 
the heavier gravity, the calm bland- 
ness of the Consul’s manner, the 
sheer nonsense he was talking — all 
these factors were combining to 
make Carman thoroughly sick. 

“What does all this have to do 
with — ” 

Blyde raised one manicured 
hand. “Economic Regulator 
Morch, through his studies, has re- 
duced to a formula the general 
economic principle known to theo- 
rists for centuries — that spending 
increases in direct proportion to ad- 
verse military news. Consumers go 
on buying sprees, remembering the 
last cycle of shortages and of rapid 
price increases. Money flows more 
freely. Of course, when the war sit- 
uation lasts long enough, a period 
of inflation sets in — making it neces- 
sary that an equally virulent peace 
be waged.” 

Dimly Carman sensed what was 
coming. “No,” he said. 

“Yes. There is no war with 
Sirius. It was a stroke of genius on 
Economic Regulator Morch’s part 
to take advantage of the uncertain- 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 




ty of interstellar communication to 
enforce a news-block on the entire 
Sirius system. It’s a simple matter 
to distribute fabricated war com- 
muniques, invent wholly fictitious 
spaceships which perish gorily on 
the demand of the moment, arouse 
public interest and keep it at a high 
pitch — ” 

“You mean,” Carman said tone- 
lessly, “that Morch invented this 
whole war, and arranges Terran 
victories and losses to fit economic 
conditions back home?” 

“It is a brilliant plan,” said 
Blyde, smiling complacently. “If a 
decline in spending occurs, word of 
severe losses in space reaches the 
home front, and the bad news 
serves to unloose the purse-strings. 
When the economy has been rein- 
flated, Earth’s legions forge on to 
victory, and spending drops off 
again. We spend heavily in times of 
stress, when we need consolation — 
not in peacetime.” 

Carman blinked. “I spent six 
thousand dollars and forged a pass- 
port to come here and find out this! 
The one time in my life I decided 
to do something, instead of sitting 
back and letting things happen to 
me, I discover it’s all a hoax.” He 
flexed his fingers experimentally, as 
if wondering what he might do 
with them. 

Blyde seemed to be sympathetic. 
“It is, I realize, terribly awkward 
for you. But no more so than it is to 
us, who have the strenuous task of 
preserving this beneficial hoax and 
protecting it from would-be ex- 
posers.” 

“Are you going to kill me, then?” 

Blyde blanched at the blunt ques- 

PASSPORT TO SIRIUS 



tion. “Mr. Carman! We are not 
barbarians!” 

“Well, what are you going to do 
with me?” 

The Consul shrugged. “The one 
completely satisfactory thing. We’ll 
find you a good job here on Sirius 
VII. You’ll be much happier here 
than you ever were on Earth. 
Naturally, you can’t be permitted to 
return home.” 

But the man who can forge a 
passport to Sirius can also find a 
way home. In Carman’s case it took 
him seven full months — months of 
living in the sticky endless heat of 
Sirius VII, dodging the playful ur- 
sinoid natives, kowtowing to Blyde 
(whose secretary he became, at $60 
a week) and wearing a brass nose- 
ring through his nostrils. 

It was seven months before he 
had mastered Blyde’s signature to 
his own satisfaction, and knew 
enough of local diplomatic protocol 
to be able to requisition a spaceship 
from the small military outpost just 
outside Zuorf. A messenger — there 
were no phones on the planet, for 
obscure religious reasons — came to 
the Consulate to announce that the 
ship was ready. 

“Wait outside,” Carman told the 
boy. 

Blyde looked up from behind his 
desk and said, “What ship does he 
mean?” 

“The one I’m taking back to 
Earth,” said Carman, and released 
the sleep-capsule. Blyde smiled 
sweetly as he slipped into uncon- 
sciousness. Carman followed the 
boy to the spaceport. 

A slim, trim two-man ship waited 

89 




there, sleek and golden-hulled in 
the bright sunlight. The pilot was 
an efficient-looking space-tanned 
man named Duane. 

“Diplomatic pouch,” Carman 
said, handing over the leather at- 
tache-case he had prepared for the 
occasion. Duane stored it reverently 
in the hold, and they blasted off. 

“Sirius IV first,” Carman or- 
dered. “Fm supposed to take films. 
Top-secret, of course.” 

“Of course.” 

They circled the small pock- 
marked gray fourth planet at 50,- 
000 feet, and Carman took enough 
cloud-piercing infra-red shots to 
prove conclusively that there was 
not and never had been any war 
between the amiable amphibious 
aborigines and Earth. Satisfied, he 
ordered the pilot to proceed im- 
mediately toward Sol. 

They reached Earth nineteen 
days later, on 3 August 2672. A 
squad of security police was wait- 
ing for them as they landed at 
Upper Urb-district Spaceport, and 
Carman was swiftly conveyed to a 
cell in Confederation Detention 
House in the tunnels far below Old 
Manhattan. Blyde had sent word 
ahead via subradio concerning Car- 
man’s escape, it seemed. 

In his cell, later that evening. 
Carman was visited by a parched- 
looking, almost fleshless man in the 
blue cape and red wig of high 
governmental office. 

“So you’re the culprit!” 

“That’s what they tell me. Who 
are you?” 

“Ferdan Veller, Administrative 
Assistant to Regulator Morch. The 
Regulator sent me to see who you 



were and what you were like.” 
“Well, now you’ve seen,” Car- 
man said. “Get out.” 

Assistant Veller’s melancholy 
eyes widened. “I see you’re a fprce- 
ful man, Mr. Carman. No doubt 
you’re full of plans for escaping, 
recapturing your confiscated films, 
and letting the world know what a 
dastardly hoax is being perpetrated 
in the interests of a balanced 
economy. Eh?” 

“I might be,” Carman admitted. 
“You might be interested in this 
morning’s telefax sheet, then,” Vel- 
ler said. He extended a torn-off 
yellow strip. 

The headline was: 

NEW AGGRESSION 
THREATENS EARTH! 

Government City, 3 Aug 2672 
—Word reached Earth today of 
yet another threat to her peace, 
coming, hot on the heels of the 
recently-concluded police action 
in the Sirius sector. Forces in the 
Great Andromeda Nebula have 
issued statements inimical to 
Earth, and a new conflict 
looms — ” 

“You killed off Sirius because 
you were afraid I’d expose it,” 
Carman said accusingly. “And now 
you’re starting up a new one.” 
Veller nodded smugly. “Quite. 
The Great Andromeda Nebula 
happens to be 900,000 light-years 
away. The round trip, even by hy- 
perdrive, takes some twenty years.” 
He grinned, showing a double row 
of square tartared teeth. “You’re a

THE 

RAIDER 



BY DON BERRY 



HEY DROPPED the raider on 
the night side, less than thirty 
miles from Thanlar, the capitol 
city. The dark, slim ship drifted si- 
lently to the ground, discharged its 
passenger and lifted again, moving 
slowly like a great shark in the 
night. On the way out into space, it 
was caught by the defense screens 
of Thanlar and disappeared in a 
gout of flaming energy that lit up 




91 



the entire night sky. 

The raider did not see it; he was 
already asleep. 

He slept, and his dreams were 
troubled by images of a familiar 
face. Strong cheekbones, the mane 
of white hair, the famous half-smile 
of Mayne Landing, Earth Commis- 
sioner to the Colony Planets. 
Mayne Landing, the gentle repre- 
sentative of Terra to her children, 
the kindly old gentleman with the 
fist of steel, the benevolent despot 
over a hundred Colony Planets. 

Mayne Landing: victim. 

The raider woke with the dawn, 
a dawn that was slightly more red- 
tinged than the sun he was used 
to. He gathered his small store of 
equipment together and cached it 
in the low scrub of the surrounding 
forest. By a clear, sparkling stream 
he washed, wincing slightly from 
the shock of the too-cold water 
against his face. 

He wore clothes indistinguishable 
from the other farmers of this dis- 
trict, slightly shabby, a uniform 
dun color. They did not fit him 
well, but they could not hide the 
wide shoulder and slim waist. Well, 
it didn’t matter: the farmers of 
this planet, like all the Colonies, 
had to work hard to scrape their 
meager living from the rocky soil. 
They were all in good condition; 
he would not be conspicuous. 

He finished washing and dried 
himself on the sleeve of his jumper. 
Then he began to walk down the 
rocky hill to the village that stood 
in the tiny valley below. In the 
early sun, the tiny assemblage of 
white clean houses sparkled like a 
handful of sand-polished shells clus- 



tered on a beach. He stopped for 
a moment, halfway down, looking 
at the village. 

It was a nice little place, he 
thought. Peaceful in the early light, 
calm. There were a few people 
moving about the streets, probably 
farmers early on their way to the 
fields. It was a pastoral scene, like 
something he had read in a book 
a long time ago. 

Nice, he thought. Quiet. I won- 
der what it will he like when Fm 
finished here. 

It didn’t pay to think about 
things like that. Not in his business. 

He let his eyes shift slightly to 
take in the tall towers of Thanlar, 
just visible over the crest of hills 
on the other side of the valley. 
Thanlar, the capitol. That was his 
concern. That was what he had to 
think about, not the village. 

He sighed once, started down the 
hill again, walking slowly, picking 
his way through the loose rocks 
with care: 

As he neared the village, he 
passed several crews of men going 
out into the fields. He greeted them 
in Interlingua, and they replied 
shortly, without curiosity. He knew 
he was a stranger to them; they 
did not recognize him, but they 
showed no curiosity. These days, 
curiosity was not much advantage 
to anyone, he thought. The farm- 
ers had probably learned long ago 
not to show too much interest in 
any stranger who suddenly ap- 
peared from nowhere. 

He came into the village and 
walked quickly to the faded wooden 
sign that announced, TAILOR. 
Entering the little shop, more a 

DON BERRY 



92 




general dry-goods store than a tai- 
lor, he moved to the rear, to a 
small counter. No one was there, 
and he rang the bell on the counter. 

After a moment, a man ap- 
peared, hastily buttoning a tunic, 
his hair still tousled, sleep in his 
eyes. 

“Yes, yes? What is it? You are 
too early.” 

“My apologies, old man,” said 
the raider. “I am looking for a 
hunting cloak.” 

The small man’s eyes narrowed. 
“Ah,” he said. “A hunting cloak. I 
have several. What did you have in 
mind.” 

“Something in gray. To suit my 
name.” 

“Ah. And what might you be 
hunting, Mr. — Gray?” 

“An animal of my home planet. 
It is called a jackal.” 

“Ah.” 

The old man suddenly turned 
from the low rack of cloaks and 
stared directly at his customer. His 
mouth compressed in a thin, bitter 
line. 

“So. You are he. The Mr. Gray 
who hunts the jackal. Come.” 

He turned and led the way into 
his living quarters behind the 
counter. 

“I will tell the others you are 
here,” he said. He left through a 
rear door, leaving the raider to 
wander about the tiny room, in- 
specting it without interest. He had 
seen too many like it in the past 
five years to be interested. Dingy 
little rooms in the back of a store, 
insect-ridden chambers in public 
lodgings, shack in the backwoods 
outside a city, too many, too many. 



And never a place to rest. 

After this one, he promised him- 
self. After this one. 

Soon the little tailor came back, 
and there were two others with 
him. One was a ferret-eyed little 
man with a suspicious stare, the 
other a heavy-set farmer. The 
heavy-set man had a scythe in his 
hand, he had apparently been on 
his way to his fields when the tailor 
found him. He held the scythe 
tightly, and the raider could see 
he was very nerv'ous. It was prob- 
ably the first time he had ever come 
into contact with one of the raid- 
er’s — profession. He didn’t like it. 

Extending his free right hand, 
the farmer said, “My name is Gar- 
roll. Joseph Carroll. You are — Mr. 
Gray?” 

The raider took the proffered 
hand warmly, trying to gain this 
man’s friendship. He would need 
all the help he could get. 

“Gray is my given name, Mr. 
Carroll. My last name — ” he 
laughed embarrassedly, “ — well, 
they call me Wolf, for the time 
being.” 

“Appropriate,” said the man bit- 
terly. 

“I’m sorry I have to meet you 
under these conditions, Mr. Car- 
roll, very sorry.” 

The other shrugged, keeping his 
eyes fixed on the raider’s lean, 
brown face, trying to guess what 
sort of mind lay behind it. 

“In these times,” he said finally, 
with an air of discouragement, 
“one cannot choose either one’s 
friends or the conditions of meet- 
ing. 

The ferret-eyed man had been 



THE RAIDER

watching the exchange closely, and 
now he sidled up to the raider 
with his thin, white hand extended. 
“Please forgive Joseph,” he said 
smoothly. “He is not happy about 
this affair.” His voice exuded a sort 
of artificial charm, and Wolf 
found himself repelled by the man. 

“None of us do,” he said. He 
turned to the farmer again, who 
was standing uncomfortably, his 
eyes on the floor. Wolf watched 
him for a moment, just long 
enough for the farmer to know he 
was being watched. 

“Perhaps,” said Wolf slowly, “we 
had better straighten this out right 
now.” 

The heavy-set man looked up 
defiantly. “All right,” he said. “I 
admit I do not like this business, I 
do not like what you are here for, 
I do not like what will happen to 
our village when you are gone.” 
The thin man laughed. “The old 
man means to say he is a coward.” 
“No,” said the man stubbornly, 
without taking his eyes away from 
Wolf. “I am not a coward. But 
your mission means death for many 
people, people I call my friends. I 
do not like that.” 

“There is a necessity,” said Wolf, 
quietly. 

“Perhaps, perhaps,” said Joseph 
Carroll, shaking his head dubiously. 
“I do not pretend to understand 
the political complications. I know 
only that, whether you succeed or 
fail, our village is lost. Our people 
will suffer for what you do. Many 
will probably die. You cannot ex- 
pect me to like that.” 

“No,” Wolf agreed. “We do not 
expect that of you, Joseph. No one 



expects you to like this. But, tell 
me — ” 

“Yes.” 

“What was your tax the past 
year?” Wolf asked. 

The old man laughed bitterly. 
“Seventy-nine percent.” 

“Enough to live on?” 

“Barely,” said Carroll, leaning 
heavily on the scythe. “It means 
we must work many hours, sixteen 
or more a day, in order to survive.” 
“That is what we fight,” said 
Wolf simply. “That, and the near 
slavery of many of the Colonies. 
Do you know what happens to the 
money you pay the Ter ran Fed- 
eration in taxes?” 

“No,” admitted Carroll. “No one 
has dared ask.” 

Wolf laughed. “And yet they say 
the Federation is a republic? When 
the citizen does not dare ask what 
happens to the taxes that are 
ground out of him? Fll tell you, my 
friend Joseph. It is used for ad- 
ministration. Simply that. Admin- 
istration of a space empire is an 
expensive project, and you must 
pay for it. It costs a great deal of 
money, our treasured Empire. And 
what does the administration con- 
sist of? Machinery to collect taxes. 
It is like a snake that feeds on its 
own tail, Joseph. Taxes are in- 
creased in order to have enough 
money to collect more taxes. It 
never ends.” 

“This is one thing,” said Joseph. 
“The killing of people is another.” 
“How many do you know who 
have died in Debtor’s camps, or 
died because they could not work 
hard enough? Joseph, this is no life 
for a man. The Colonies cannot de- 



94 



DON BERRY 




velop under the Federation. They 
must be free to govern themselves. 
Otherwise, we have simply a great, 
cancerous tumor, spreading through 
the universe, calling itself the Ter- 
ran Federation.” 

Joseph sighed. “All right,” he 
said. “In principle I agree. The 
colonies must be free. But is there 
no other way than murder and 
assassination? This violence — ^what 
can come of it? And if the revo- 
lution succeeds eventually, how 
can we know the Federation will 
not be replaced by the same thing 
under another name?” 

“Because you will govern your- 
selves,” Wolf said. “Every Colony 
will be autonomous, trading as a 
sovereign nation with the other 
Colonies. The idea of a Galactic 
Empire is self-defeating, Joseph, it 
is unhealthy, vicious. The only way 
man can go to the stars with his 
head up, is without dreams of in- 
finite power blinding him.” 

“You are an idealist,” said the 
ferret-eyed man, with surprise. 

“A man must live for some- 
thing,” said Wolf, quietly. 

“Certainly, certainly,” the thin 
man agreed quickly. “I was sur- 
prised to find an idealist in your — 
trade.” 

“My trade is as distasteful to me 
as it is to you,” said Wolf, speaking 
more to Joseph Carroll than to the 
pale, thin man. 

“What will the death of Mayne 
Landing accomplish?” Carroll 
asked. 

“Confusion. He is the Adminis- 
trator of over one hundred planets. 
He is a strong man, a focal point. 
Without him, without his personal 



strength, the administration of those 
planets will falter, and stop. It isn’t 
that he carries on the routine work, 
of course. But decisions come from 
him, the decisions that cannot be 
made by routine, the decisions that 
require a man’s creative spark. 
Without that, the routine itself can- 
not stand.” 

“It rather sounds as if you re- 
spect the man,” said Carroll. 

“Respect him? I — ” Wolf hesi- 
tated, uncertain. “Yes,” he finished. 
“I respect him. He is doing what 
he thinks is right, as I do what I 
think is right.” 

“And you would kill a man for 
whom you hold no hatred,” Carroll 
muttered. “This thing is making 
beasts of us all.” 

If you only knew, thought Wolf, 
if you only knew, 

“Sometimes it is necessary,” he 
said aloud. “Sometimes bad things 
are necessary, that good may fol- 
low.” 

Carroll sighed. “Well, we are 
committed now. We must go 
ahead.” 

“I will need detailed informa- 
tion on Landing’s plan of inspec- 
tion,” Wolf said. 

“You will have it,” Carroll told 
him. “Daimya has been in the city 
for five days, listening and watch- 
ing. 

“Good,” said Wolf. He felt bet- 
ter now, getting into the operation. 
This he knew, this he could handle. 
It was what he was trained for. It 
was the other things that were bad, 
the thinking, the wondering, the 
long nights spent sleepless, uncer- 
tain. 

“When will he be back?” Wolf 

95 



THE RAIDER 




asked. “This Daimya.” 

“She. Daimya is my daughter,” 
Carroll said. “Even our children 
must have blood on their hands. 
She will return this evening.” 



D aimya came, just after 

dark. Wolf was startled. He 
had expected a child, from the 
way Carroll spoke, and Daimya was 
far from a child. She was a slim 
woman, in her early twenties, he 
estimated. Her body was sleek and 
fit, and her long black hair was 
tied behind her head, where it 
flowed over her back like a water- 
fall carved from ebony. She had 
large eyes, slightly almond shaped, 
that regarded him solemnly as she 
gave the information she had 
gathered. 

“He will come to inspect this vil- 
lage in two days,” she said. “He 
will visit four farms, picked at ran- 
dom, and then there will be a pro- 
cession down the main street.” 
“That would be our time,” Wolf 
mused. “Crowds about.” 

“Some will be killed,” Daimya 
objected. “His guards will not take 
this thing lightly.” 

“I am sorry,” Wolf said sincere- 
ly. “It is our best chance of suc- 
cess.” 

Daimya shrugged. “You are the 
killer, not I,” she said, with obvious 
distaste. 

Wolf felt an impulse to explain, 
to justify, to make this slight girl 
see that he hated this. Angrily he 
fought it down. 

It doesn't matter what she thinks^ 
he told himself. It doesn't matter. 
What matters is to get the job done 



and get out. That's all. 

“Tell me,” Daimya said curious- 
ly, “how do you come to be mixed 
up in a thing like this? You don’t 
act like a hired killer.” 

Wolf laughed shortly. “No,” he 
said. “I’m an amateur. I was a 
Captain of the Security Patrol 
once. My whole family was in Fed- 
eration Service, as a matter of fact. 
I was on Colony Patrol for three 
years. In that time I saw so much 
suffering, so much injustice, so 
much simple cruelty that — well, 
never mind. When I was con- 
tacted by a member of the revolu- 
tion underground, I deserted. It al- 
most killed my father. Since I was 
familiar with the Federation’s 
higher echelons, I was assigned the 
pleasant job of assassin.” 

“How many men have you killed 
in that job?” Daimya asked, almost 
casually. 

Wolf watched her for a long mo- 
ment before answering. “You don’t 
want to ktiow that,” he said slowly. 

The girl dropped her eyes. “No. 
No, I guess you’re right. I’m sorry.” 
She stood and went to the door. 
She stopped there and turned, look- 
ing at Wolf. He met her eyes and 
held them with his own, frankly, 
without embarrassment. 

“I’m sorry,” she repeated. She 
closed the door softly behind her, 
and Wolf bent to study the map 
of the village she had provided. 



T he village lay in a cup- 
shaped valley. The main street 
was also a direct highway out of 
Thanlar. On either side of the 
highway, the farmer’s fields 

DON BERRY 



96 




stretched, checkered brown and 
green, to the foothills. The entire 
valley was not more than a mile 
wide, and the fields extended only 
a quarter of a mile on either side 
of the main road. The foothills 
added another quarter of a mile, 
and then, abruptly, the mountains 
started. 

Though one of the principal 
highways to Thanlar, the main 
street was fairly narrow, bordered 
closely on either side by the small 
business district, composed mostly 
of single story buildings constructed 
out of native lumber from the hills. 

Wolf decided the center of the 
business district would offer the 
most concealment. Any group of 
men at any other place would be 
viewed with suspicion by Mayne 
Landing’s bodyguards, and their 
chances would be proportionately 
diminished. 

It remained to determine the 
most effective weapon. Explosive? 
No, too many villagers would be 
killed. Yet that would certainly be 
the most certain way, a grenade 
thrown from the roof of one of the 
low buildings. He wondered how 
thoroughly the Administrator’s men 
would check the village before the 
procession. 

Joseph Carroll told him the 
check was cursory; except for the 
spasmodic attacks of the revolution 
underground, the Colonies were 
submissive enough, and the pre- 
cautions taken were in the nature 
of routine. 

It looked to be easy. Wolf 
thought wryly. The easiest of them 
all, since the planet was fairly dis- 
tant from the scene of previous un- 



derground operations. 

They wouldn’t be expecting it, 
he thought. Down the main street 
in procession, the Administrator 
standing in the little ground car, 
smiling and waving to his subjects, 
genial, effusive. And then — 

“Joseph,” said Wolf suddenly. 
“How many men can I depend 
on?” 

“Perhaps thirty,” said the farm- 
er. “Perhaps a few more.” 

“Are they completely depend- 
able?” 

“Within reason,” said Carroll. 
“They are farmers, not soldiers. 
Plows are more familiar to them 
than guns.” 

“How many can you get me that 
will obey me without question, no 
matter what?” 

Joseph Carroll tugged absentiy 
at his ear. Finally, he shrugged. 
“Perhaps five,” he said. “Including 
myself.” 

“All right,” sighed Wolf. “It will 
have to be that way, then. But the 
others can be depended on ‘within 
reason?’ ” 

“Yes,” Carroll said. “Do not ex7 
pect too much. They do not like 
this business.” 

“Neither do you,” Wolf said. 
“But you count yourself among the 
five trustworthy.” 

Carroll didn’t answer, and Wolf 
took his silence as a declaration of 
faith. 

“All right,” he said. “Leave me 
now. At sunset, bring your men to 
me, all of them. I will work out the 
attack.” 

“Very well,” said Carroll, and 
started to leave. 

“Joseph,” said Wolf softly, and

the older man tui ned at the door. 
“What is it?” 

“What about Daimya?” 

“What about her?” 

“Where will she be during — this 
attack?” 

“At home, I expect,” said Car- 
roll. “Where she belongs.” 

Wolf toyed for a moment with 
the map that lay before him. 

“Joseph,” he said. “What will 
happen to the village?” 

“You don’t know?” asked Carroll 
in surprise. 

“No,” Wolf admitted. “I have 
never stayed behind.” 

Carroll laughed bitterly. “One 
of two things,” he said. “They will 
either demolish it from the air, in- 
cluding the populace, or they will 
put everyone in one of the forced 
labor camps.” The farmer made a 
small gesture of resignation. 

“I didn’t know,” Wolf said, al- 
most under his breath. Can 1 be 
responsible for that? 

“They don’t like Colonists coop- 
erating with the revolutionaries,” 
Carroll continued. “Did you expect 
they exempted us all from our taxes 
as a reward?” 

“No,” Wolf said. “But I didn’t 
know it was so — complete.” 

“They are thorough,” the old 
man shrugged. “Any village where 
an incident occurs is made an ex- 
ample. Before long, you people will 
not find much welcome in the 
Colonies.” 

“I suppose not,” Wolf mused. 
“Perhaps by then — ” 

“You really believe you’re going 
to succeed in overthrowing the 
Federation, don’t you?” 

“I must,” said Wolf. “Without 



that, all this — ” he gestured to the 
map before him, traced with ar- 
rows, notations, ideas, “ — is mean- 
ingless slaughter.” 

“So it seems,” Carroll said flatly. 
“Joseph,” said Wolf suddenly. 
“With luck, there will be a ship 
waiting for me in the mountains 
when I’ve — finished here.” 

“That’s your good fortune,” Car- 
roll said grimly. 

“Will you come with me?” 
“And join the revolutionaries?” 
“You — and Daimya.” 

Carroll considered it slowly. 
“No,” he said finally. “Not I. I 
have gotten my people into this, I 
must stay with them. All were 
against it when you first contacted 
us. All but me. It is my fault. I 
have to stay with them.” 

Wolf felt a sudden surge of affec- 
tion for the old man. Reluctant he 
might be, but he knew what he was 
doing and he knew the conse- 
quences and was willing to accept 
them. 

“And Daimya?” 

“That is a different matter,” said 
Carroll. “It is not right that she 
should suffer for her father’s folly.” 
Or that a father should suffer for 
his son^s folly, thought Wolf. But 
he said nothing. 

“You would take her?” Carroll 
asked. 

“If* I am— able,” said Wolf. 

“All right,” said the old man. “I 
will see to it. Better she should be 
alive than dead. That is all that 
matters.” 

Wolfs final plan was simple. He 
had not enough men to count on a 
direct attack. The major work 



98 



DON BERRY 




would be performed by the depend- 
able five, of which Carroll assured 
him. The others would be used to 
create a diversion to cover the ac- 
tual assault. 

There was a slight bend to the 
highway just before it entered the 
village. When the procession passed 
this point, they would see a group 
of men disperse quickly into the 
low scrub at the side of the road. 
This would put them on their 
guard, they would be apprehensive, 
watching. 

When the procession had en- 
tered the village itself and was 
within the short commercial strip, 
there would be an explosion back 
of them. Grenades, perhaps some 
shooting. If Wolfs prediction were 
accurate, this would divert the at- 
tention of at least the major por- 
tion of guards for long enough. 

Long enough for the five men 
in the crowd to do what they had 
to do — 

“This must be timed perfectly,” 
he told the man who was to head 
the diversionary squad. 

“I understand that.” 

“Too soon or too late, either will 
destroy us. It will take us too long 
to reach the Administrator. He 
must be exactly opposite the tailor’s 
shop. It must be done right.” 

“It will be done right.” 

“If it is not, all the sacrifices are 
for nothing, you understand that? 
The consequences will be as bad, or 
worse, for the village, and we will 
have accomplished nothing. If the 
Administrator is dead, there will be 
time for most of the villagers to es- 
cape into the hills before the Fed- 
eration can take action against 



them.” 

The man left, after Wolf had 
provided him with the weapons his 
group would need from his cache 
on the nearby hillside. 

The dependable five were in- 
structed in their parts, and then 
there was nothing to do but wait. 

The next morning dawned clear. 
The air was cool, a slight breeze 
ruffled the fields around the village. 
As the sun rose higher in the sky, 
it glinted sharply from the towers 
of Thanlar. 

It had been impossible to keep 
the entire operation a secret from 
the villagers. They knew some- 
thing was to happen, and they 
knew it concerned the inspection 
trip of Mayne Landing to the vil- 
lage. It was not hard to guess what 
it was. 

As the day drew on toward noon, 
the tension of the people grew. 
Small knots of farmers gathered on 
the comers, their fields forgotten 
for the day, talking low. 

Wolf didn’t like it, it was too 
obvious. The village was primed, 
ready to explode, and he was afraid 
the tension would make the guards 
too alert. They had to be just tense 
enough to respond to the diversion, 
not enough so they would be 
watching everywhere. He was 
counting on an instinctive, rapid 
response. 

He sat behind the tailor shop, 
talking to his men with a confi- 
dence and calm he did not feel. He 
spoke as if the success of the mis- 
sion were a foregone fact, and the 
escape of the villagers into the hills. 
But he knew it was tenuous. 

Perhaps he had planned it too 



THE RAIDER

critically. Perhaps a simple direct 
attack would have been better. 
Perhaps, perhaps — 

Any number of things were pos- 
sible, he thought. But it was done 
now. If he had made a mistake, 
they would know soon. 

On the contraband comset be- 
hind the tailor shop. Wolf had 
called the mother-ship that hovered 
just out of detection range. All 
right, they confirmed, there would 
be a shuttle in the hills back of the 
town. Did he know the shuttle that 
had brought him had been lost? 
No? Well, it had. With the whole 
crew aboard. 

That many more, thought Wolf. 
If anybody's keeping a list, Tve got 
a lot to my credit. Or damnation. 
And, bitterly: More friends than 
enemies. 

Don’t think about it. Do your job 
and get the hell out. If you can. 

He spoke to Daimya, but on her 
father’s advice did not tell her of 
his plan to take her along. 

“She won’t go voluntarily,” the 
old man said frankly. “We will 
have to pretend we are all going to 
the hills. After that — ” he nodded 
slowly, “ — the problem is yours.” 

“I will take care of her, Joseph,” 
Wolf had promised, and the sun- 
browned farmer had clasped his 
hand tightly in a mute gesture of 
hopefulness. 

“You understand — a man and 
his daughter — you understand?” 

More than you probably know, 
Joseph. 

“Yes,” he said aloud. “I think I 
understand.” 

And then came the word that 
the Administrator’s procession was 



in sight. 

Wolf looked at his five depend- 
ables. He passed each face slowly, 
as if he had never seen them be- 
fore. They were young, and old, 
and middle-aged. They were dark 
from the hours in the sun, strong 
from the work that pulled their 
muscles for the long hours each 
day. They smiled at him, grimly, 
nervous, but they were good men. 

The faces of freedom. Wolf 
thought. These are the faces and 
the bodies of freedom. 

Then it was time. 



HE STREETS WERE lined 
with silent people when the 
procession came into view around 
the slight curve. 

Then there was a tentative cheer 
from someone. It was taken up by 
someone else, and soon the crowd 
was roaring its synthetic apprecia- 
tion of Administrator Mayne Land- 
ing. Woff breathed easier. 

Craning his neck in the crowd. 
Wolf spotted the other five, stand- 
ing dispersed in the crowd, but all 
near the spot on the street opposite 
the tailor’s shop. They made no ac- 
knowledgement except meeting his 
eyes, then turning away to watch 
the procession near. 

As they came closer. Wolf noted 
with satisfaction that several of the 
guards occasionally glanced at the 
street behind them. 

Good. They had seen the knot 
of men outside town, then. If they 
expected anything, they were ex- 
pecting it from behind them. 

He could see the tall, straight 
figure of Mayne Landing in the 

DON BERRY 




100 




ground car. He took in the familiar 
face almost hungrily, the great 
shock of white hair moving gently 
in the slight breeze, the character- 
istic gesture, a half-salute, the 
slight smile, the kindly eyes of the 
old man — 

He tore his eyes away from the 
dignified figure and glanced behind 
him, down the street. He saw a fig- 
ure move on a roof-top, and won- 
dered if the guards saw it, too. 

Then the ground car was oppo- 
site, and Wolf had a wrenching 
sensation that the diversionary 
squad was not going to go through 
with it . 

An explosion rocked the street a 
block away, shaking the ground 
underfoot, shattering windows in 
the adjacent stores. A billow of 
dirty black smoke began to drift to- 
ward the sky. There was a scatter- 
ing of small, explosive fire. 

The tone of the crowd’s roar 
changed. It deepened and became 
a mass cry of confusion and fright. 

Quietly, Wolf edged forward to 
the street, automatically noting 
that his men were doing the same. 
Several of the guards had turned, 
were running back toward the 
source of the excitement, and oth- 
ers were turned toward it. But 
those around Mayne Landing had 
not responded. They were keeping 
their eyes fixed on the crowd. They 
were too well trained to be drawn 
off, and Wolf cursed under his 
breath. 

He stopped his forward motion 
and waited, rocking on the balls of 
his feet. This was the part he 
hadn’t told his five about. 

Suddenly there was a flurry in 



the crowd on the opposite side of 
the street. The nearest guard 
whirled, in time to draw his hand 
gun and fire. The first of the five 
sprawled in the street, a bloody 
stump where his head had been. 
But the guard’s blast had not been 
in time to stop the long mowing 
knife that buried itself to the hilt 
in his throat. He lurched forward, 
dropping the hand gun. His mo- 
mentum carried him almost into 
the edge of the crowd, and a wom- 
an screamed hysterically. 

Wolf’s other men had been only 
a fraction of a second behind the 
first, and the street was now a chaos 
of shouting and the sharp, flat re- 
ports of the guards’ hand guns. 
The crowd milled frantically, add- 
ing to the confusion as the attack- 
ers leaped at the procession. 

Wolf waited, waited, watching 
for the single split-second when the 
guards were fully engaged with 
the crowd. 

Then it came, and their heads 
were momentarily turned away 
from Mayne Landing. 

Wolf sprinted from the crowd, 
the short stiletto cradled in his 
hand. He leaped to the side of the 
ground car just as Mayne Landing 
turned toward him. 

He saw the old man’s face clearly 
in that moment. It held no fear, 
but only an unbelievable surprise, 
an astonishment beyond under- 
standing. Then the stiletto slid 
gently into the throat, severing the 
jugular, and all surprise and emo- 
tion was lost in the implacable 
blank agony of death. The still- 
pumping heart forced a pulsing 
stream of bright arterial blood 



THE RAIDER 



101 




around the blade of the knife. 

Then, as quickly as he had come, 
Wolf was gone. He slipped back 
through the crowd, into the door 
of the tailor shop. Seconds later, 
Joseph Carroll was there, one side 
of his gray farmer’s tunic turning 
brown-black from the blood that 
soaked it. 

“Come on!” Carroll snapped, 
running for the back. 

“What about the others?” 

“Gk)ne,” said the old man short- 
ly. “All of them.’; He dashed out 
the door of the tailor shop into the 
back and Wolf followed him. 

“Daimya!” Wolf shouted. 

“She’s waiting for us in the foot- 
hills.” 

The sound of the crowd and the 
blasting of hand guns was loud be- 
hind them as they began their dash 
across the checkered fields. For a 
few moments, nothing followed. 
Then Wolf heard a faint shout be- 
hind them, and a huge gout of dirt 
erupted from the field beside him, 
almost knocking him down. 

He regained his balance and 
started to run low, crouched and 
zig-zagging while the tiny explosive 
pellets pocked the field around him. 
It seemed an eternity before they 
had crossed the field, but he knew 
it was not more than a couple of 
minutes. 

Joseph Carroll was ahead of 
him, already beginning to tear 
through the scrub growth of the 
foothills, making his way up. Just 
as he entered the undergrowth. 
Wolf saw the old man joined by a 
smaller, slighter figure. 

There was a roar in his ears, and 
he fell, a searing pain across his 

102 



back. Numbly, he realized he’d 
been hit, but somehow it didn’t 
seem important. He picked him- 
self up and followed Carroll into 
the scrub. Soon he was out of sight 
of their pursuers, though the ex- 
plosions of their weapons still fol- 
lowed them with uncanny accuracy. 

He caught up with the old man 
and his daughter in a small clear- 
ing. Carroll lay with his head 
cradled in Daimya’s lap, gasping 
for breath. 

“We’ve got to go on,” Wolf said. 
“Come on. I’ll help.” 

“You’re hurt!” the girl said. 

“Not badly. Come on, we’ve got 
to get your father out of here!” 

The old man put his arms 
around the shoulders of the other 
two, and they struggled up the hill, 
breaking their way through the 
brush, slipping, sometimes falling. 
Behind them, there was still the 
occasional sound of the explosive 
pellets, and infrequently, one came 
very near. 

“Close,” muttered Wolf as an 
explosion showered them with dirt. 
“They’re on the path now.” 

They went a few steps farther, 
and Joseph slumped between them. 

“Dad!” called Daimya. “Please! 
Please try to go on!” 

Wolfs hand slid down the old 
man’s back, came away warm and 
wet. 

He was silent for a moment, 
then gently lowered the suddenly 
limp body to the ground. 

“Come on,” he said to Daimya. 
The girl was standing over the inert 
form of her father, not understand- 
ing what had happened, words of 
encouragement still on her lips. 

DON BERRY 




“Dad?” she said, bewildered. 

Wolf took her arm. “Daimya, 
he’s gone. Gome on.” 

“No— Dad— ” She knelt beside 
him on the ground. 

“Sorry, Daimya,” Wolf said un- 
der his breath. He swung, hitting 
her cleanly behind the head. The 
girl collapsed soundlessly, and he 
slung her over his shoulder and 
started on up the hill. 

Finally, he cleared the crest. Just 
beyond it, lying in a tiny meadow 
lay the black, unmarked shuttle 
ship. As he came in view, the port 
opened and a man ran toward him. 
Wolf stumbled, caught his balance, 
went on. 

“Here,” said the crewman, “let 
me take her.” 

Silently, out of fatigue. Wolf re- 
linquished his load and stumbled 
toward the port. It slid shut behind 
them, just in time to keep them 
from being covered with dirt blown 
from a hole that suddenly appeared 
a yard behind. Wolf caught a 
glimpse of men appearing at the 
crest. 

Inside the ship, he could hear 
the thud and clang of the explosive 
cartridges detonating uselessly 
against the permalloy hull. Then 
the drives roared their song of 
power, and the shuttle lifted clear. 

The crewmen were more than 
curious. 

“Who the hell’s the girl?” 

“Got me. Never heard of such a 
thing.” 

“Well, I suppose a Raider has a 
right to pick up a little booty now 
and then,” another laughed. “They 
don’t have the easiest job in the 



world.” 

“Bet she’s going to be mad when 
she wakes up.” 

“Yeah. Looks like the Raider 
might be worrying a little about 
that right now.” 

Wolf stood at the forward screen, 
silerftly watching the shape of the 
mother-ship grow larger and larger 
until the screen held nothing but 
the great black hull. 

The crewmen were wrong, he 
wasn’t worried about Daimya’s 
waking. He could take care of that 
when the time came. 

He was thinking about other 
things, the things that came to him 
when he slept, the faces, the names, 
the actions, the right and wrong of 
living according to what you tlunk 
is right, no matter what the cost. 

But the cost, the cost . 

It was so high sometimes, so ter- 
ribly high. 

This trip, he thought. A shuttle 
crew. Five good men, probably the 
whole village, eventually. Those 
who did escape into the hills would 
lead a life of fear and pursuit, for- 
aging as they went until finally 
they were caught. And worst of all, 
this was worst of all, and mentally 
he saw the list, the list of his re- 
sponsibilities, the list for which he 
would someday have to account. 

The bright name of Mayne 
Landing : victim. 

His mind shied away from it. 

Can that he forgiven? Can such 
a thing ever be forgiven? 

Gray Landing, called Wolf in 
the underground, turned away 
from the forward screen and began 
to prepare to board the mother- 
ship. END

P ASTOR LANVIN entered the control room at an 
inopportune moment, being in time to overhear the 
greater part of an acrimonious exchange between Cap- 
tain Triggs and Galder, his Mate, A faint smile flickered 
over the missionary’s lean, deeply lined face as he listened 
to the richly embroidered invective. 

“Call yourself a navigator!” bellowed Triggs. “It 
breaks my heart when I think of all the better navigators 
that I’ve flushed away!” 

“Well, we’re here,” said Calder sullenly. 

“Yes, we’re here. Only three million odd miles from 
the damned planet, and God knows how many tons of 



The Bureaucrat 



reaction mass we shall have to wasffe chasing it round in 
its orbit! If you had some big, fat blonde waiting for you 
there you’d have slid into normal space- time only half an 
inch from the surface.” 

“If you’d kept your big, dirty -paws off the drive con- 
trols — ” flared Calder. “Of all the pests in space, there’s 
none worse than a master who can’t mind his own busi- 
ness. The drive was running perfectly until you wrecked 
it. Why the bloody hell can’t you leave things alone?” 

“The drive was not running perfectly, and you damn 
well know it, Mr. Calder. If I hadn’t taken charge we’d 
have finished up away to hell and gone outside the 
Galaxy!” 

Calder made the only possible reply — the monosyllabic 
one. Then he saw Lanvin. He flushed. 

“Good morning. Pastor,” he said. 

Captain Triggs hastily smoothed his rugged features 
into an expression of amiability.

It has been said that if God didn’t exist, it would 



be necessary to invent him. And that’s just 



what someone had done on backward Gerak 



“Gk)od morning, Pastor,” he 
echoed. He gestured towards the 
wide viewports, which now showed 
the normal blackness of space, the 
nonnal bright, unwinking stars, in- 
stead of the distorted swirls of mul- 
ticolored light that were all to be 
seen when the interstellar drive was 
in operation. “We got you here.” 

“So I see,” said Lanvin. “So I 
heard.” 

“Just letting off steam,” ex- 
plained Triggs. “You will appreci- 
ate that interstellar navigation is 
rather a strain on the nerves. 
Look!” He pointed. With the slow 
rotation of the ship the sun of this 
planetary system was swinging into 
view, a blazing disc, its corona giv- 
ing it an oddly winged look. Hastily 
Calder operated the dimmers, re- 
ducing the light striking through 
the big ports to a tolerable intensity. 
“Look! There she is — and that ball, 
just to the left of her, is Gerak.” 

“How long before we land?” 
asked Lanvin. 

“About three days — although it 
may be longer. There’s no space- 
port, of course, and we may have to 
waste time looking for a suitable 
landing place.” 

“Time spent in the service of my 
Master is never wasted,” said Lan- 
vin gently. “Besides — the Society is 
paying you generously for your serv- 
ices.” 

“No more than the usual charter 
rates,” pointed out Calder sourly. 

“They’re helping to keep you in 
a job,” snapped Triggs. “Anyhow 
— we are wasting time hanging out 
here admiring the scenery. Get her 
lined up for Gerak, and get the 
rockets started as soon as you can!” 

106 



Calder started barking into the 
microphone. “All hands prepare for 
acceleration! All off-duty personnel 
to acceleration couches! All hands 
prepare for acceleration!” 

“You may stay here if you wish. 
Pastor,” said Triggs. “The Second 
Officer will not be coming up, and 
you can take his chair.” 

“Thank you, Captain,” said Lan- 
vin. 

The surge of acceleration press- 
ing him deeply into the padding of 
the chair was a reminder to La*tivin 
of the gravity to which he would 
soon have to become accustomed 
once more. Always, at the conclu- 
sion of a voyage, was there this feel- 
ing of regret, almost of loss. He did 
not subscribe to the theory, now 
widely held, that only in deep space 
is Man close to his Creator — but he 
would have hesitated to denounce 
it, as it had been denounced, as yet 
another addition to the long list of 
heresies. 

He focussed his attention on the 
little, glowing ball — Gerak — that 
the ship was chasing. He reviewed 
in his mind the data that had been 
placed at his disposal by the Direc- 
torate of the Society. Mass, atmos- 
pheric pressure and content, hu- 
midity and climate were so close to 
Earth normal that he did not an- 
ticipate inconvenience or discom- 
fort on that score — and he reproved 
himself for having allowed himself 
to consider that aspect of his mis- 
sion. The people were humanoid, 
intelligent — but, according to the 
reports available from the Inter- 
stellar Sui'vey Commission, living in 
a state of savagery. They were 

A. BERTRAM CHANDLER 




pagans. They had a loose frame- 
work of superstitions but no re- 
ligion, no God. 

It was all to the good, he 
thought. He would be able to build 
without having first to destroy. It 
was all to the good, too, that Gerak 
was a protected planet — which 
meant that it was out of bounds to 
traders and prospectors. He smiled 
as he remembered the long and bit- 
ter war between the Society and the 
Bureau of Interstellar Affairs, at 
the conclusion of which permission 
had been granted to the Society to 
send its missionaries to the protected 
worlds — at their own risk. 

There was risk, of course; there 
is always risk. The Society already 
had its roll of martyrs — but the 
price paid in blood was not, 
weighed against the successful 
spreading of the Word on four 
score worlds, a heavy one. 

The tenor of his thoughts was in- 
terrupted by Calder’s voice. 

“Fm cutting to one G now. Pas- 
tor. If you like, you can return to 
your cabin.” 

“Thank you, Mr. Calder,” re- 
plied the Pastor, “but I think that I 
shall stay here awhile. There is 
something inspiring in the spectacle 
of the Hosts of Heaven.” 

“I know what you mean,” said 
Captain Triggs. “I often think that 
it would be a good thing if all the 
atheists and agnostics could be 
shown the stars as they really are — 
shining bright and clear with no 
atmosphere, no mist, no cloud to 
dim them . .” 

“Why?” asked Galder. 

“Well . How can I put it? 
As the Pastor said — the Hosts of 



Heaven ...” 

“I’m sorry,” said Calder, “but 
they’re just stars to me. I know that 
each one is a sun, and I know that 
most of them have families of 
planets, and I know that if I do 
thus and thus and so and so I can 
proceed from one to the other.” 
“Mr. Calder!” snapped Triggs, 
“I’ll thank you not to be blasphe- 
mous!” 

“I don’t think that there was any 
blasphemy,” said Lanvin softly. 
“Mr. Calder is entitled to his own 
opinion — just as you and I are. 
Captain. He’s a spaceman, doing 
his job — and, on this voyage at 
least, he is acting in the direct serv- 
ice of my Master.” 

“It’s a pity. Pastor,” growled 
Triggs, “that you won’t have time 
to do any missionary work aboard 
this ship! There are some people 
here who need it!” 

“Perhaps there are,” agreed Lan- 
vin. “Tolerance is one of the vir- 
tues, you know.” 

“It all depends what you’re tol- 
erating,” said Triggs. 

HE LANDING on Gerak was 
more spectacular than orthodox 
— and even Triggs could not blame 
his Mate either for the near-crash 
or its disastrous consequences. 
Triggs himself was at the controls, 
and ignored Calder’ s warning about 
the possible effects of the wind 
sweeping across the plain towards 
which the ship was descending, bal- 
anced on the column of fire that 
was her interplanetary drive. The 
plain was almost featureless, that 
was the trouble; it was just a huge 

107 




THE BUREAUCRAT 




sea of grass or something so like 
grass that it made no difference. 
Galder got the sights of the drift 
indicator on to a low hummock and 
was able to get a rough estimate of 
lateral speed, but Triggs ignored his 
findings, snapping: “You can’t do 
any more than guess over this sort 
of terrain.” 

“Then let me fire a smoke 
rocket,” said Galder. 

“And start a prairie fire? What 
sort of welcome do you think the 
Pastor will get if his coming deva- 
states half a planet?” 

“We’ll start a fire when we land 
in any case,” pointed out Galder. 

“Not if the foam-flood apparatus 
is in working order — and it’s your 
job to see that it is.” 

The foam-flood apparatus was in 
working order — but it might just as 
well not have been. As soon as the 
ship touched, as soon as the tips of 
her vaned landing gear dug into 
the soil, the weight of the wind on 
her bows tilted her. The steering 
vanes, set as they were in the ex- 
haust, were useless ; the servo-mech- 
anisms whose job it was to maintain 
equilibrium gave up in despair. 

Triggs did the only possible thing 
— fed power into the rockets to 
drive his ship up and clear from the 
treacherous surface, but the rocket 
thrust added its quota of energy to 
the coupling moment that was al- 
ready almost uncontrollable. The 
ship tilted, and went on tilting. 
With a crash that smashed instru- 
ments and apparatus she toppled, 
toppled and rolled, and her incan- 
descent exhaust cut a wide swathe 
of blazing destruction through the 
dry grass, well outside the range of 

108 



the foam-flood ejectors. Triggs re- 
tained consciousness long enough to 
cut the drive, but then it was too 
late, much too late. A raging sea of 
fire, stretching from horizon to 
horizon, was racing down wind. 

Pastor Lanvin offered thanks to 
his God that none of his shipmates 
had perished in the crash. Indeed, 
casualties had been surprisingly 
light, nobody had suffered damage 
more severe than contusions and 
abrasions. Galder, of course, was 
more inclined to give the credit for 
this to the manufacturers of the ac- 
celeration chairs and couches than 
to the Almighty, and earned a re- 
buke from his Gaptain for voicing 
his thoughts aloud. 

“At least, sir,” said Galder nasti- 
ly, “I wasn’t giving the credit to 
you.” 

Triggs ignored this, but in such a 
manner as to make it clear that the 
subject would be reopened later. 

He said .to the Pastor, “I’ve in- 
spected the baggage hold. I’m 
afraid that your helicopter is 
smashed beyond repair, so are your 
solar batteries. About all that re- 
mains in good condition is your 
tent.” 

“Then I still have greater world- 
ly possessions than many of those 
who spread the Word in the past,” 
said the Pastor. “Tomorrow morn- 
ing I will start to walk to the east — 
it seemed to me that there was a 
forest in that direction as we 
landed.” 

“If there’s any forest left,” said 
Galder. “The wind is from the 
west.” He added, with a real sym- 
pathy, “I’m afraid that this has 

A. BERTRAM CHANDLER 




rather started you off on the wrong 
foot, Pastor. By your coming you 
have caused considerable damage 
— and, it may well be, loss of life. 
The people of this world will be 
more inclined to regard you as an 
emissary of the Devil than of 
God . 

“Who can say how their minds 
will work?” asked the Pastor. 

“I shall send an officer with you,” 
said Triggs. “He will take one of 
the spacesuit radio sets with him, to 
keep in touch. He will report on the 
state of the forest — when you reach 
it. He will let me know if it is pos- 
sible to recruit native labor to bring 
heavy spars to the scene of the 
wreck.” 

“Heavy spars?” asked Lanvin. 

“Yes. The ship, I am sure, can 
be repaired with what we carry in 
the way of spares and plant. But 
she has to be up-ended before she 
can take off — and the only way to 
do that, on a primitive planet such 
as this, is by rigging a sheerlegs. All 
hands will be busy on repairs — if 
native labor can bring the spars to 
us it will expedite matters consid- 
erably.” 

“I see,” said the Pastor. “Frank- 
ly, I shall be glad of company, even 
though it may be only for a short 
while. May I choose my compan- 
ion?” 

“Certainly.” 

“Then,” said Lanvin, “I should 
like Mr. Calder to come with me.” 

“A rather surprising choice,” said 
Triggs at last. 

“A logical one,” replied the mis- 
sionary. “Do you think that we 
could step outside, Mr. Calder, so 
that we may assess the magnitude 

THE BUREAUCRAT 



of the task that lies before us?” 

“Certainly,” said the Mate. 

The two men groped and stum- 
bled through the compartments 
and shafts of the wrecked rocket, 
each of them feeling the strange- 
ness of walking on what should 
have been vertical plating, of see- 
ing what should have been decks 
reared upright before them like 
walls. They came to the airlock, 
the doors of which had already 
been opened. They jumped down 
to the charred stubble, which ex- 
tended as far as the eye could see 
on every side ; the flames had 
worked back against the wind as 
well as running before it. 

The sun — huge and ruddy be- 
hind the pall of smoke — had almost 
set. Swiftly it dipped, and then was 
gone. The darkness came fast — 
they were not, Lanvin remembered, 
far from the equator of this world. 
The darkness came — but it was not 
a true darkness. All around them, 
lurid, ominous, was the glare of the 
fires. Above them, reflecting the 
ruddy light, was the smoke. 

“It’ll be a long walk,” said 
Calder, “and a dirty one.” 

“At least the wind has dropped,” 
said Lanvin. 

“If it had dropped before, as we 
were landing, it would have been 
more to the point,” said the Mate. 
“Did you ever read Gibbon, Pas- 
tor?” 

“Of course. Why?” 

“One point he raises. A good one. 
At what precise date did the 
Church lose the power to perform 
miracles?” 

“Did the Church ever have that 
power?” asked Lanvin. 

109 




‘‘It’d be a handy power to have 
right now,” said Calder, ignoring 
the counter question. “Nothing 
fancy — just a little fire-fighting.” 
Lanvin was staring towards the 
east. 

“It may be my imagination,” he 
said, “but I think that the fires are 
going out.” 

“You’re right,” said Calder at 
last. He added, almost fiercely, “But 
there must be a natural explana- 
tion.” 

“Of course,” agreed the Pastor. 

T hey set out at sunrise. 

They were as well equipped as 
was possible. They had the Pastor’s 
tent, which was big enough for the 
two of them. They had a trans- 
ceiver, removed from one of the 
spacesuits and packed into a not too 
uncomfortable makeshift haversack. 
They had a good supply of concen- 
trated food tablets — borrowed from 
the lifeboat stores. They had water, 
and both of them hoped that it 
would be enough. They had a shot- 
gun and a fair supply of ammuni- 
tion. They had a compass. 

When they started, Calder took 
the lead. He strode ahead purpos- 
ively, not deigning to look back at 
the ship. Lanvin followed at an 
easier pace. By noon it was the mis- 
sionary who was always a few steps 
ahead of his companion. Lanvin 
took no pride in this^ — after all, he 
was used to covering long distances 
with no other means of transporta- 
tion but his feet. Even so, he was 
enjoying the walk no more than 
was the ship’s officer. His eyes were 
red-rimmed and smarting and his 

no 



throat and nose were clogged with 
ashes. 

It was at noon that Lanvin called 
a halt. 

Calder helped him to set up the 
little tent — it afforded some protec- 
tion from the pitiless sun. The two 
men sat in the tiny patch of shade, 
nibbling their food concentrates, 
washing them down with tepid 
water. 

“I suppose,” said Calder hope- 
fully, “that we can’t afford any for 
a wash . .” 

“No,” said the Pastor. “And even 
if we could, we should soon be as 
black again as we are now.” 

“Cleanliness has never been a 
strong point of the Church, any- 
how,” remarked Calder. “In my 
own private code of ethics it comes 
a long way before godliness.” 

“Why are y6u so hostile?” asked 
Lanvin. 

Calder grinned, his teeth gleam- 
ing whitely in his blackened face. 

“I’m just a natural anti-clerical, 
I guess. I always have been.” 

“And yet,” said the Pastor, “in 
your profession you are in a posi- 
tion to see all the wonders of Crea- , 
tion.” He pointed. “Look there!” 

“I see a calcined skeleton,” said 
the Mate. “I see the remains of 
some poor beast that was caught in 
the fire.” 

“But look at it. Here we are, the 
two of us, sitting on this world 
thousands of light years from Earth 
— and yet that skeleton could be 
that of a Terran ungulate. You 
can’t deny that there’s a Divine 
Plan.” 

“Was it part of the Divine Plan 
that the coming of a missionary 

A. BERTRAM CHANDLER 




should bring fire and death and 
destruction?” asked Calder. “But 
let’s get back to the skeleton. Its 
late owner, as you say, could have 
been something built and function- 
ing on the lines of a Terran ante- 
lope. But what does that prove? 
Have you never heard of parallel 
evolution, Pastor? Have you never 
considered how two such unrelated 
species as the shark and the por- 
poise, living in the same medium, 
have become almost identical twins 
insofar as external form is con- 
cerned? Furthermore, if you grant 
the validity of Arrhenius’ theory, it 
is logical to assume that all Earth- 
type planets will produce approxi- 
mately the same life forms.” 

“Arrhenius,” said the Pastor 
softly. “The seeds of life, drifting 
through the Universe, driven by the 
force of light itself, tangling in 
gravitational fields like thistledown 
in a spider’s web . .Who sowed 
the seeds, Mr. Calder?” 

“I don’t know,” said Calder. 
“Neither do you.” 

There was silence for a few min- 
utes. 

Then: “We will sleep for three 
hours,” said Lanvin. 

The pressed on through the late 
afternoon, through the fast gather- 
ing dusk. It was not quite dark 
when they came to the line — sharp, 
clearly defined — where the fire had 
died. On the one side of it there was 
the charred stubble — on the other, 
the long grass. 

“What do you make of this?” 
asked Lanvin. 

“A miracle, perhaps,” scoffed 
Calder. Then his voice became 



serious. “I’ve seen something like 
this before.” 

“Where?” asked the missionary. 
“New Wyoming — or, if you pre- 
fer it, Deneb IV. It’s a rich planet 
— and all its wealth is on the hoof. 
Cattle. Most of the land surface is 
prairie, like this. They have oc- 
casional prairie fires. They have 
very efficient fire-fighting robots — 
helicopters with built-in intelligence 
and the wherewithal to swamp 
huge areas with carbon dioxide.” 
“No machine can be intelligent,” 
said the Pastor automatically. 

“That remark was the typical, 
machine-like reaction that one ex- 
pects from one of the cloth,” said 
Calder. “But we’re getting away 
from the point. If there are such 
robots here, it argues a high level 
of technological civilization. But we 
saw no cities. There’s no spaceport. 
According to all the data we have, 
this world is uninhabited save for 
its savage aborigines.” 

“God put out the fire,” said a 
new voice. 

“Of course,” agreed Lanvin. 
Then, startled, “Who are you?” 

“I am the priest of God,” came 
the reply. “You are the demons 
whose coming he foretold.” 

“Come out of the grass!” shouted 
Calder, “and let’s see you!” 

“Lay down your weapons,” came 
the reply. 

“Put down the shotgun, Mr. Cal- 
der,” whispered Lanvin. 

“Like hell! I don’t like this.” 

“Put it down, I say! After all — 
this priest, whoever he is, speaks 
English. I’m afraid,” he went on, 
his voice rueful, “that I am not 
the first, after all, to labor in this 



THE BUREAUCRAT

vineyard . 

Calder ignored this last. 

“I still don’t like it. He’s a priest, 
and he speaks English — but neither 
fact is a guarantee that he won’t 
have us slaughtered out of hand.” 

“If his people have bows or blow- 
pipes they coud do it now,” rea- 
soned Lanvin. “Lay down the gun.” 

Reluctantly, the Mate put down 
the weapon. Slowly, he and the 
missionary backed away from the 
weapon. Its burnished metal caught 
the last of the daylight, held it, so 
that all around was very dark. 

The men who stepped out from 
the long grass were tall, and black, 
and could be distinguished only as 
vague shadows against the dark 
background of vegetation. They 
carried weapons. Spears? Blow- 
pipes? Lanvin could not be sure. 
One of them came slowly forward, 
advancing cautiously to meet the 
two Terrans. He, like his com- 
panions, was naked. 

Lanvin blinked. The priest was 
not, after all, naked — but his only 
article of clothing made his nudity 
an affront to the missionary. It was 
white, apparently of some stiff 
plastic, and was worn around his 
neck. It was a mocking parody of a 
Roman collar. 

“At least,” said Calder, “they 
don’t intend to sacrifice us right 
now.” 

He and Lanvin were lying, not 
too uncomfortably, in the long 
grass. Their wrists and their ankles 
had been bound — skillfully, but not 
so tightly as to interfere with circu- 
lation. The warriors lay all around 
them, sleeping. None of them, Lan- 



vin was reasonably sure, could 
speak English. The priest, as be- 
fitted his superior rank, was sleep- 
ing some distance from the others. 

“We have no reason to assume 
that they are going to sacrifice 
us,” said Lanvin quietly. 

“All right. So we haven’t. But 
just what is this set-up. Pastor? 
You’re the expert.” 

“I wish I knew,” said Lanvin. 
“The priesthood — I assume that 
there is more than one priest — 
speaks English. It could well be 
that English is the language of the 
Church here, just as Latin was on 
Earth, centuries ago. But why? 
How?” 

“I can guess,” said Calder. “The 
survivor of some shipwreck — or, 
perhaps, some unscrupulous trader 
— has set himself up as a local deity. 
He must have seen our landing — 
and sent out his parties of warriors, 
led by his priests, to take us all 
prisoner.” ,He muttered a curse. 
“And I never had the savvy to use 
the radio before that blasted priest 
took it from us, just as he took 
everything else that would be of 
value if we escaped. He knew what 
to look for, all right. Someone put 
him up to it.” 

“It can’t be a trader,” said Lan- 
vin. “Such a thing could never be 
hidden from the Bureau of Inter- 
stellar Affairs. They’re far too 
thorough. It can’t be a survivor 
from a shipwreck. As you should 
know, if any vessel is reported miss- 
ing every inch of her route is 
searched.” 

“I still say that it could be 
either,” insisted Calder. 

“We shall find out in the morn- 



112 



A. BERTRAM CHANDLER 




ing,” said Lanvin. “Meanwhile, I 
suggest that we emulate our captors 
and sleep.” 

They slept. 



W ITH THE FIRST light they 
were awakened by kicks from 
broad, horny feet. While the priest 
supervised, two of his men, work- 
ing nimbly with their three fingered 
hands, removed the bonds from the 
Earthmen’s ankles. Then, while the 
others stood around, blowpipes 
poised and ready, the lashings were 
taken from their wrists and they 
were given foul-tasting water from 
a skin, a handful each of something 
that could have been sun-dried 
fruit. 

While they broke their fast Lan- 
vin and Calder studied their captors 
with interest. All of seven feet tall 
they were, and thin, and their noses 
were like elephant’s trunks in mini- 
ature. The teeth that gleamed 
whitely in the glossy black faces 
were widely spaced. Yet — they were 
men. There was no denying that. 

“We came in peace,” said Lan- 
vin to the priest. 

“You came to destroy our 
world,” replied the priest. “You set 
fire to the prairie. But God warned 
us of your coming, and God sent 
his angels to put out the fires.” 
“Who is your God?” asked Lan- 
vin. 

“There is only one God, and he 
is God,” came the answer. 

“One would almost think,” said 
Calder, “that your Moslem rivals 
had got here first. But we shall get 
nowhere with theological argu- 
ments.” He asked, “Why do you 



speak English?” 

“English? I do not understand. 
We — the priests — speak the God 
language. We can write it, too. But 
God warned us against too much 
talking with the demons.” He 
snapped an order to his men in his 
own tongue. The two who had re- 
moved the bonds from Lanvin and 
Calder now replaced the ropes on 
their wrists. There was a trail 
through the long grass, and the 
party followed it, the priest well in 
the lead. 

At first Lanvin and Calder tried 
to take notice of all that they saw 
— the gaudy insects, the things like 
flying lizards, the tracks, at right 
angles to their own path, that 
showed that something huge had 
passed that way. They tried to ob- 
serve, and they tried to pass com- 
ments on what they saw — but, after 
less than an hour, they could no 
longer afford to waste breath on 
talking, could not afford to let their 
attention wander from the ground, 
with its tough, treacherous grass- 
roots, beneath their feet. 

There was a halt at noon — a 
brief rest and a pause for refresh- 
ment. The priest kept well away 
from the prisoners and refused to 
answer Calder’s shouted questions. 
There was another halt in the 
middle of the afternoon — and, after 
this one, neither Lanvin nor Calder 
thought that he would be able to 
get to his feet again. 

They did get to their feet — the 
point of a knife (Calder’s own 
knife, and that hurt him almost 
more than the physical pain) judi- 
ciously applied ensured that. They 
kept on marching ; they had no 



THE BUREAUCRAT 



113 




option. They reeled and staggered 
and, at the finish, each of them had 
to be supported by a pair of the 
natives. 

It was dusk when they came to 
the edge of the forest. They hoped 
that the priest would order a halt, 
but he did not do so. The path 
through the wood was worse than 
the path through the prairie had 
been; it was uneven, and on each 
side were the viciously spined bran- 
ches of man-high shrubs. Lanvin 
could have sworn that the things 
had motility, that they reached out 
with malicious intent to rend the 
skin of the passer-by. 

Then there was a light ahead — 
pale and steady. 

It could not possibly be the glare 
of fluorescent lamps, the missionaiy 
told himself — but it was. It came 
from only one building of the large 
village that stood in the clearing — 
a village that was improbably neat 
and clean, far too well laid out. Oil 
lamps burned in the houses, women 
and children stood in lighted door- 
ways and stared curiously at the 
Earthmen. Other black figures 
stood in attenuated silhouette 
against the harsh illumination from 
the . the temple? 

Yes, thought Lanvin. It must be 
the temple. There’ll be a screen on 
the roof to collect solar power, and 
there’ll be batteries to store it, and 
there’ll be some fat ruffian sitting 
on a throne and impressing these 
poor children of nature with his 
puny, man-made miracles . And 
he has brought us here to jeer at us 
and to impress his flock still more 
by killing the demons. I feel rather 
sorry for Calder . After all — 



being martyred is part of my job, 
it’s not part of his. And he’s not 
ready . 

The temple was built of stone. It 
was severe in its design — a severity 
that contrasted with the ornate 
eaves, the elaborately carved lintels, 
of some, but not all, of the houses. 
Some of them aped the functional 
architectural style of the . 
temple? 

It must be the temple, thought 
Lanvin again. 

With Calder, he stumbled up the 
broad stone steps. With Calder he 
stood, dazed and dazzled, in the 
glare of the lights. He heard a 
rhythmic tapping, the occasional 
tinkle of a tiny bell. He heard a dry 
rustling sound. He heard a sharp, 
imperative buzzing. 

That must be an altar, he 
thought. But it’s not. It’s a desk — 
and there’s a native woman operat- 
ing an electric typewriter . And 
that’s another priest coming to meet 
us, and he- has a bundle of papers 
in his hand, and they look like 
printed forms . And there are 
more desks, and more typewriters, 
and some people filling in forms , . 

He said to the Mate, “Mr. Cal- 
der, I must be delirious.” 

“I thought that I was. Pastor,” 
replied Calder. “It seems that this 
God of theirs has to be approached 
through the proper channels.” 

“Gant!” the priest of the temple 
was saying, “why did you bring the 
demons here? They could have 
been taken just as easily to Merum’s 
temple. You knew very well that 
I’m behind with my returns and 
you know that God rarely accepts 
excuses!” 



114 



A. BERTRAM CHANDLER 




“He will be pleased that we have 
captured the demons,” replied 
Gant. “I think that the situation 
carries priority, and that the tele- 
phone should be used rather than 
the post.” 

“He does not like us to use the 
telephone unnecessarily,” replied 
the other. “He said, ‘A word spoken 
is gone with the wind, a word writ- 
ten endures forever.’ ” 

“I agree that the correct forms 
must be filled in,” said Gant, “and 
I would like to say that some of 
your staff would be better employed 
so doing than in staring at the 
demons. Meanwhile, I should like 
to use your telephone.” 

“This is my temple, Gant, and 
nobody but me talks to God from 
inside these four walls.” 

“As you please,”^ said Gant. 
“After all, he knows who made the 
capture.” 

The other priest vanished to- 
wards the far end of the big room. 
Gant ordered a junior priest — he 
wore a very thin collar — out of the 
chair that he occupied behind a 
desk. He took the seat himself, 
pulled a printed form from a rack 
of such stationery, a stylus from its 
holder. He motioned to Lanvin and 
Calder to stand before him. 

“Now, if you please,” he said in 
a dry voice, “I will take note of 
your vital statistics.” 

“We want food first,” croaked 
Calder. “We want a drink. We 
want a rest.” 

“Address your complaints to 
God,” said the priest, “through the 
proper channels.” 

“Have done with this blas- 
phemy!” cried Lanvin. 

THE BUREAUCRAT 



“Blasphemy? You must, indeed, 
be a demon. The only blasphemy 
is the neglect to fill in the forms 
properly.” 

“Gant!” The other priest was 
back. “Get out of that chair. Fill 
in your forms in your own temple.” 

“Oh, all right.” 

“I have talked with God. He 
says that the demons are to be fed 
and watered. He says that he is 
sending an angel to pick them up 
and to carry them to Heaven, 
where he will interrogate them.” 

“So be it,” said Gant. 

Neither Lanvin nor Calder was 
surprised that the “angel” was a 
robot helicopter. It dropped down 
from the night sky, landing in the 
village square with a heavy thud. 
It stood there, its vanes slowly ro- 
tating, making impatient noises. As 
soon as the passengers had boarded 
it shot up like a rocket, levelled off 
and then flew eastwards. 

Heaven was the snow-capped 
summit of a mountain all of three 
miles high. Heaven was a warren 
of tunnels and chambers, the en- 
trance to which was so cunningly 
concealed as to be invisible either 
from space or from the air. Heaven 
was a paradise of filing cabinets 
and electric typewriters, of desks 
and electronic calculators, peopled 
by beings of a type all too familiar 
to both the Pastor and the space- 
man. Heaven had as its device, 
shining on walls and ceilings, glit- 
tering on the neat but otherwise 
drab uniforms of the men and 
women, the six pointed star of the 
Bureau of Interstellar Affairs. 

God was a little man sitting be- 

115 




hind a big, polished desk. He was 
in a bad temper. “God” was a good 
agnostic, and made this quite clear 
to Lanvin in the first five seconds 
of their conversation. “God” did 
not like missionaries. 

“There will be trouble about 
this,” he prophesied. “Big trouble. 
The fool who gave you permission 
to land here will be demoted. This 
is an experimental planet. We are 
giving the people a religion that 
will allow them to regulate their 
lives in a sane manner, that will 
leave behind an enduring frame- 
work when the need for supersti- 
tion has passed.” 

“The same,” said Lanvin, “can 
be said for my Society — but we 
never encourage superstition.” 

“To hell with you and your 
Society,” he flared. “You will be 
returned to your ship in the morn- 
ing. You will stay there until 
she has been repaired. I will give 
whatever aid may be needed.” 
“Having failed in my duty,” said 

CONSERVATION 

(Continued from page 79) 

“And it was their faulty, groping 
sort of maintenance that saved our 
lives, because even a heat-gun de- 
teriorates in 150 years. That gun 
hadn’t been fired since the Revolt!” 
“Then we can be their salva- 
tion?” suggested Phil. 

“Yes. The scientists who built the 
Deneb colony can rebuild the tech- 
nology of our own Earth. It will 
take a long time . there’ll have 
to be schools and we’ll all have to 
work hard . but maybe some of 
us will be able to go back, in 30 or 



Lanvin softly. 

“That is the good fortune of the 
natives of this world.” 

“Mr. Godfrey,” said Calder, “I 
used to think that I was of the 
same religious persuasion as your- 
self. I used to take pride in my 
atheism. But you’ve done more to 
convert me than the good Pastor 
could — converting me to religion, 
I mean. It’s your arrogant blas- 
phemy that sticks in my throat. It’s 
the way in which you, a confessedly 
godless man, take to yourself the 
attributes of a deity . .” 

“But he’s not godless, Mr. Cal- 
der,” said the Pastor. “He’s not 
godless — and that’s the worst part 
of it. This place is as much a 
temple as was that bleak, efficient 
shrine in the village. 

“You have a God, Mr. Godfrey 
— and It has made you Its own 
image. But when you blunder — as 
you will, as you must — It will 
never have mercy upon your soul.” 
“Amen,” said Calder. END 



40 years, say, when the Discovery 
can return to Deneb.” 

They were nearing the ship, and 
John saw the officers crowding the 
main port, watching them come. 

“It’s sort of inconsequential, I 
know,” said Ann then. “But several 
times the Third Sarge referred to 
us as ‘deevs.’ Did he mention to 
you what a deev is?” 

John smiled. 

“It’s an ancient military slang 
term, just like ‘sarge’ and ‘top- 
kick,’ ” he replied. “ ‘Deev’ is just 
plain old D.V. Distinguished Visi- 
tor. And I suppose we are, at that.”

A QUESTION OF 
IDENTITY 



(Continued from page 58) 

a new body, new thoughts, new 
blood and new reproductive capac- 
ity. The fact that this new man can 
be brought to trial violates justice 
in its deepest and truest meaning! 
It points inescapably to the fact 
that the law must be revised to 
bring it up to date with present 
reality . 

Jake paused and was silent for so 
long that he appeared to have for-, 
gotten his surroundings. When he 
finally continued, his voice was so 
soft that the jurors unconsciously 
leaned forward to catch his words: 

“There is still another dimension 
to this case — one that transcends 
science . and the law. It is one I 
approached with great uncertainty, 
because it leads down a path I am 
walking for the first time . 

“Some of the testimony brought 
out in this trial may not have been 
new to all of you, though it was 
new to me. Perhaps you have all 
formed your own conclusions with 
regard to the relationship between 
the spirit or soul of Man, and his 
outer shell . the house in which 
man lives. But if this house becomes 
a prison for the real man, and sci- 
ence releases him to live in a new 
dwelling, then did the man ever 
actually exist until his release? And 
if the man who lives now did not 
exist at the time of the crime for 
which he is tried, can he then be 
judged guilty? 

“Ladies and gentlemen of the 
jury — we await your answer.” 



T wilight faded, and across 
Central Park the skyline of the 
city changed from steel and con- 
crete to a gossamer web of light 
and shadow. Jake Emspak sat in 
peace by his window, the fingers of 
his right hand resting gently on the 
gold frame of his wife’s picture. 
He touched a button on the arm of 
his chair, and in a moment Ed 
Murrow’s features came into focus 
on the wall-screen. 

“The jury in the Corfino case is 
now locked up for the night,” Mur- 
row began, his 80-year-old voice 
more vibrantly alive than ever. 
“Tomorrow we may — and very 
likely will — have a verdict. 

“But whatever the verdict, this 
case has served an epochal purpose 
— to our time as well as to the law. 
We have paused for an instant in 
our frantic drive for technological 
advancement to ponder the essen- 
tial meaning of man — and the 
worth of the human entity. 

“It may take years to evaluate 
and appreciate all of the complex 
testimony Jake Emspak put into the 
trial record, for each of us will see 
in it only what we want to see or 
are capable of seeing . 

“But we may be assured that in 
the generations to come this case 
will be footnoted throughout the 
opening worlds of space by serious 
students of the law, the sciences 
and the humanities. 

“For tonight, it should suffice to 
say: Thank you, Jake Emspak — 
Well done!” 

Jake touched the button again, 
and the screen went dark. Between 
old friends, there was much that 
words left unsaid. END

I like the range and scope and 
imagination of science fiction. 
There are no clear-cut rules, and 
the author is given a chance to do a 
good bit of real thinking about our 
future and where the human race 
is going and why. He can create a 
world of magic and mystery, a situ- 
ation that can be dazzling or de- 
pressing. He can, if he is skillful, 
project his readers into sometliing 
difTerent and exciting. But, besides 
just giving the readers escape, he 
can make them think. The science 
fiction I don’t like disregards all 
these things and just uses a strange 
setting to battle out the same old 
problems (usually with a “blaster” 
or a “death ray”). These stories 
have little serious thought behind 
them and are aimed at the less in- 
telligent reader who doesn’t want 
to think. 

IP’s stories are usually credible 
within the limits set up for them 



and are entertaining. Also, they 
are not so loaded with scientific 
philosophy that they lose their ap- 
peal as stories and become lectures. 
You have hit a happy balance and 
therefore have a good magazine. 

— J. Marx, Jr. 

Waterbury, Neb. 

In my opinion, science fiction can 
be and is good literature. In every 
field there are bad and good ex- 
amples. Many critics, however, 
come up with the bad stories and 
unfortunately pass judgement on all 
science fiction on the basis of these. 
One attack that has been used is 
tliat science fiction fans are all 
idiots and escapists. As an example 
of the eiTor of such statements, let 
us look at Dr. Asimov, who cer- 
tainly is no idiot. I think this one 
case refutes the whole theory of 
imbeciles in the field. In my high 
school graduating class, more than 
one half of the members of the Na- 
tional Honor Society were science- 
fiction readers and had from two 
to four years of science courses to 
their credit. The readers are edu- 
cated people just as the authors 
are. I wish someone in the critical 
world would start a campaign to 
hit the readers of sportscar, hi-fi, 
mystery, girlie, movie, confession 
and boating magazines. This sort 
of reading is childish too, certainly 
more so than science fiction.

Defend science fiction? Sure I 
will! My gambit with detractors is 
a simple statement of fact. There 
are two things I read — the newspa-

pers for today’s news, and science 
fiction for news of the future. 

— Mrs. R. Bessette

More people should be made to 
think, introduced into new chan- 
nels of thought; they should be 
shown the world from new per- 
spectives. All too many see only 
their own narrow horizons. It is 
just such attitudes which cause 
shameful affairs like that at Little 
Rock. People must learn that the 
world exists beyond their little 
niches. They must be forced into 
other people’s shoes. They must be 
shown the human-ness of people 
they have never seen whether they 
are on Mars or in Russia. If we 
cannot concede that our own 
planet’s inhabitants ire all of the 
same blood, bone and flesh, how 
can we admit it in the face of 
aliens from outer space? That there 
is hope is patent, when we look at 
history and discover what cruelty 
was rampant . Today, people 
in the Western hemisphere gener- 
ally proclaim the brotherhood of 
Man, and ostensibly, we believe in 
peace and freedom and justice for 
all. Somewhere it began and grew; 
surely someday it will encompass 
the Earth. And how much science 
fiction can do to help it along! It 
can educate and indoctrinate the 
blind and inhibited so that they 
may grow intellectually and spir- 
itually. This is more than a duty — 
it’s our one chance. Others are do- 
ing what they can, through writ- 
ing and radio, by example and by 
personal endeavor. Science fiction 
is in a position to do its small bit 



and it’s worth the effort. We may 
not live to see the result — but it 
will come and science fiction’s part 
will be a vital one in the end. A 
reward worth the doing.

Your pleasant questionnaire de- 
serves an answer. I am a house- 
wife, wife and mother, 54 years old. 
I have a Ph.D., speak four lan- 
guages and have travelled all over 
the world. Why do I read science 
fiction? It is my only hobby, and 
it satisfies all my needs. If there 
were enough science fiction I would 
need no other reading matter. It 
has everything from patent law to 
mysticism; from symbolic logic and 
logical symbolism to pure mathe- 
matics and technology; from love 
and adventure to politics and so- 
ciology; from psychiatry to zanie- 
ness, from biology, medicine, chem- 
istry to foreign languages, ancient 
history and prophecy ; painting, 
music, farming — what’s the use, it 
is impossible to enumerate them. 
It widens one’s horizons immeasur- 
ably, gets people interested in 
things they would never have 
thought of, shows youngsters what 
they really are interested in when 
they are ready to choose a career, 
and keeps oldsters from becoming 
rigid, narrow and discouraged. Of 
course, I have to defend it when 
caught reading it, it’s difficult to 
make converts because we are tak- 
ing many premises for granted in 
the really good stories. And the 
bad stories are, of course, bad.

And man is a dissatisfied animal. 
Satisfy him and he ceases to be a 
man. Quiet him and he stops being 
alive. 

Phillips stood with his feet 
planted against the centrifugal force 
that simulated one-third Earth-nor- 
mal gravity, knowing where he was 
with a spaceman’s sure instinct. He 
was 1,075 miles above the surface 
of the Earth, in a two-hour orbit, 
in a satellite spinning once every 
22 seconds. 

The Earth was Inside. He was 
Outside, and with boldness, with 
courage, and with infinite sacrifice, 
he could stay Outside. 



He was moving. He was alive. By 
being alive here, by outfacing the 
eternal ' enemies — heat, cold, and 
airlessness, distance, acceleration, 
and the ever-present missiles of 
space itself, and other men — he 
kept humanity alive. 

Once in liis life, if he is lucky, a 
man finds something worth doing. 
He had found it. 

The long journey to the stars was 
the most human thing that men 
could do. It would keep the whole 
race human. ^ 

The first trip would fail, he felt 
sure, and perhaps the second and 
the third. But one day men would 
come back from the long trip out, 
if the men who were born equipped 
to do the job did not lose faith. 

He was one of them. END
