Don't know whether or not you 
reader’s have noticed that Rog 
Phillips is back in IF’s pages again 
( Game Preserve in our June issue 
and again with Captain Peabody in 
this one) . He had a story way back 
in the January (1953) issue, and 
then did a disappearing act for 
about three years. Needless to say, 
we’re delighted to have him back 
with us — and according to Rog 
himself, he’s pretty pleased too. 
Over the past ten years or so Rog 
has written under fifteen or twenty 
pen names in the mystery and sci- 
ence-fiction fields, and has had over 
two million published words. His 
magazine stories and pocket books 
have been translated into Italian, 
German and Japanese. Aside from 
that, we’ve a sneaking suspicion this 
ex-engineer-turned-writer is now a 
full-time member of the California 
Chamber of Commerce. Every 
communique that comes through 
from him sings loud huzzahs about 
the wonderful climate of his 
adopted state. (“No snow”, he 



chortles, and seems to think this is 
a sort of climate Utopia. Now we 
hate to be snide; but what kind of 
a place is that for a fanatic skier 
like us?) Born in Spokane, Wash- 
ington, Rog has lived for longer or 
shorter periods in practically every 
part of the country, including New 
York, but now prefers the “chosen 
land”. Makes a special claim to 
never having met anyone actually 
uglier than he himself, but insists 
that people don’t seem to mind — 
they say it adds character or some- 
thing. 

A reprint of our Face of Mars ar- 
ticle by Dr. Ralph Richardson ap- 
peared in the August ’57 issue of 
Science Digest. If you missed the 
blow by blow description of the ob- 
servation of Mars on its closest ap- 
proach since 1924, by all means get 
a copy of IF for June 1957 and 
catch up on the mysterious blue 
streaks and other phenomena that 
Dr. Richardson observed and de- 
scribed in his article. While 
we’re on the subject of mysterious 
goings-on, by all means read The 
Last Secrets of the Earth by Ber- 
nard Busson and Gerald Leroy. 
The two French journalists ex- 
amine such still unknown subjects 
as the Abominable Snowman, ac- 
tive volcanoes, underground rivers 
and flying saucers among others. 
Well worth the reading! . Note 
from Ed Emsh, one of science fic- 
tions most published artists, informs 
us that he is off for a month in 
Connecticut followed by a trip to 
Canada to fulfill a portrait commis- 
sion . Big doings out in Disney- 
land, where Syl vania Electric has

just set up a house of the future 
with a lighting system that’s truly 
“out of this world”. Direct illumi- 
nation is all obtained with luminous 
domes which have been made a 
part of the ceiling construction — 
and all of which is dimmer-con- 
trolled. The study utilizes a spe- 
cially designed floating type of fix- 
ture suspended on thin nylon 
threads. Added “eye catcher” is a 
floor-to-ceiling “column of light” 
for interest and decoration. Major 
lighting in the living room comes 
from a floating dome which is inter- 
nally illuminated from a special 
projector in the floor. One room 
features draperies which are made 
of a glass fabric and become lumi- 
nous as a result of a light from the 
outside, which is concealed beneath 
a stairway. Other items include a 
“tree of light”, an illuminated 
headboard with adjustable louvres 
which can be arranged so that one 
person can read while the other 
can sleep, panel illumination, and a 
seemingly complete lack of wiring. 
This last is accomplished by having 
all wiring, except that in the core 
of the house, located in the lower 
half of the walls. 

The Second World of IF is about 
ready for the printer and we’re 
pretty proud of it already. Includes 
stories by such science fiction names 
as Charles Beaumont, Raymond F. 
Jones, James Blish, Jimmy Gunn, 
Phillip Dick, Charles Fontenay, 
Bryce Walton and Robert Young. 
All novelettes this time, and guar- 
anteed to be good entertaining read- 
ing. Watch for it ... we think you’ll 
like it. Publication is January 12th. 



Still working on the statistics about 
the readers and the writers of sci- 
ence fiction. Some small trickles are 
in (but we still don’t need that 
computer!) and the list already 
contains teachers, (we’ll break 
down the fields when more returns 
are in) teen-agers, doctors, engi- 
neers, army men, atomic scientists, 
lawyers, mechanics, librarians and 
(bless ’em) housewives. We want 
mail on the subject, for we feel that 
IF can really do a service to science 
fiction if our readers will pitch in to 
help us. Just drop us a letter or post 
card and tell us what you do for a 
living, what your hobbies are, what 
you like in science fiction, who your 
favorite authors are and what sort 
of covers and illos you like. Any 
other data that you think pertinent 
will be most welcome; but we’re 
really most interested in the above 
“vital statistics”. So let us hear 
from you real soon. 

Last minute notes: Watch for 

Frank Herbert's 21st Century Sub 
on the newsstands. Even if you 
read it as a serial, or read the hard 
cover version, the pocket edition is 
one that should be added to a sci- 
entiphile’s library. Really good 
reading. Harlan Ellison still 
pounding his portable even though 
the Army has him busy as only the 
army can keep a man. One of 
the big paint companies has actual- 
ly come up with a polka dot paint. 
. Letter from a South African 
fan tells us that the purge of litera- 
ture is getting so bad that they’ve 
even banned Black Beauty as sub- 
versive to the racial segregation 
ideal!

AND THE WALLS 






Earth’s civilization and culture lay dormant and stagnant. 



Stupidity and ineptitude reigned supreme y and the one man 



who could change it didn’t care enough — until . 



T HE SCENE at Transcontinental Televideo five minutes before re- 
hearsal time was, as always, chaotic. Technicians scurried back and 
forth, waving cue-sheets wildly in the air, shouting cryptic instructions to 
each other; dollied cameras rolled in for the dry run. The actors, tense 
and worried, congregated in the center of the sound-stage, muttering their 
lines fitfully and wondering if their psyche-projection would be sufficiently 
convincing. 

Only one man was calm. John Amory stood quietly at the extreme left 
of the stage, leaning against a camera boom, a copy of the shooting script 
dangling casually from one big hand. Near him was the director’s chair, 
a flimsy wickerwork thing whose red cloth backstrip was neatly lettered in 
yellow, MR. JOHN AMORY, but Amory preferred to remain standing. 
He was a tall broad-shouldered man of thirty-four, going gray early, with 
deep-set earnest dark eyes and bold, jutting features. He was the best 
director Transcontinental Tele video had, and he was watching the chaos 
about him coldly, impassively, hating it all but concealing his hatred. 

He glanced at his watch. Five minutes to go, he thought; then two hours 
of shaping this show into something bad enough to go out over the

coaxials, and then home, rest, and 
forgetfulness. He had lived with 
the current script — Mist of Desire , 
it was called — for a week, and that 
was eight days too long. 

Someone touched his shoulder. 
He turned slowly and looked down 
at the small wiry man who stood 
grinning at him. 

“What are you doing here?” 
Amory asked. “Come to see us 
slaughter your script, Lee?” 

“It’s not my script, and you 
damned well know it,” Lee Nourse 
said quietly. “Eight weeks ago I 
turned in a sheaf of typed-on pa- 
pers and got a fat check for them; 
then Kavanagh and his Scripting 
Committee went to work. There 
isn’t anything left of my story ex- 
cept my name on the credit-sheet, 
and I’m surprised they left that 
there.” 

“Three minutes , Mr. Amory ” 
boomed someone from the monitor- 
booth. Amory nodded acknowledg- 
ment. To Nourse he said, “It’s one 
of the best scripts I’ve ever worked 
on, Lee. At times it almost reaches 
the level of idiocy. I hope Kava- 
nagh hasn’t pegged it too high for 
his audience.” 

“He knows his job,” Nourse said. 
“Don’t worry: the Great American 
Cretin will love it. Good cast, great 
director, first-rate sensory effects — ” 
“And a top-ranking writer. Be- 
fore they started revising the script.” 
“Thanks, John.” 

“Two minutes , Mr. Amory!” 
“It’s about ready to start,” Amory 
said. “Are you really going to watch 
it?” 

Nourse smiled diffidently. “Not 
really. I’ve already cashed the 

6 



check; my interest in this script 
ends there. I came to invite you to 
a film showing.” 

Immediately Amory brightened. 
“Where? When?” 

“Ted Beckett’s place, at ten to- 
night. It’s an English-made job; 
they smuggled it in through Cana- 
da. Suppose to be lovely. Take the 
usual precautions getting there.” 
“One minute , Mr. Amory!” 
“Thanks for letting me know,” 
Amory said. He smiled grimly and 
added, “I’ll do my best with your 
script.” 

“I know you will,” Nourse said 
bitterly. 

Amory followed Nourse out of 
the studio with his eyes, then 
checked his watch and stepped for- 
ward to the director’s podium, 
script in hand. He didn’t need the 
script: part of his directorial tech- 
nique was to memorize each week’s 
production from cover to cover. It 
reassured the cast, though, if he 
kept the text handy. 

“Everybody ready,” Amory said, 
speaking quietly but with such au- 
thority that all eyes focussed on 
him. “This is the final rehearsal for 
tomorrow’s production of Lee 
Nourse’s drama Mist of Desire . 
Jimmy, are you set up?” 

“Absolutely, Mr. Amory,” said 
the Sensory Effects man. Sensies 
were pre-recorded at the dress re- 
hearsal, odors, textures and all. 
That left a full day for the tech- 
nicians to work out a sensory-track 
before the telecast. 

“Act One, then.” He looked at 
his actors, hiding his unhappiness. 
He had hand-culled them from the 
nation’s best, and yet just one of the 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 




batch knew anything at all about 
the art of acting; the rest were just 
competent memorizers. Well, he 
thought, the public can’t tell the 
difference anyway. 

The silence-light glowed. Amory 
said, “Let’s get under way, folks. 
Now.” 

Two of his actors appeared, 
gravely reciting lines at each other 
in loud histrionic voices. Amory let 
it go on for just half a minute. 

“Hold it, will you? Look here, 
Cal: there’s eight minutes of noisy 
commercial before you speak your 
first line. Dammit, make that line 
quiet. Sensitive. Just so the audi- 
ence can tell there’s been some 
transition between the client’s poop 
and the play.” 

He had been through this point 
five times now, but actors didn’t 
catch on easily. It took five more 
runnings until he was satisfied ; 
then, he let the play roll on un- 
checked for nearly ten minutes be- 
fore cutting in to demonstrate how 
a line should have been read. 

The play was some silly incon- 
sequential frippery, a typical prod- 
uct of Dave Kavanagh’s script- 
mill. Why they bothered to get a 
talented man like Lee Nourse to do 
the original story was a mystery to 
Amory; anyone at all could churn 
out this sort of formularized hack- 
work, about Real People and their 
Real Problems in the World of To- 
day. Small-scale, mindless, just 
slush to keep ninety million viewers 
looking at their sets between the 
sales-pitches. 

Everything had been carefully 
designed that way. The central 



climax of the hour-long play had 
been thoughtfully placed some four 
minutes before the middle break, 
and followed by sheer padding of 
no plot-value. That way, ran the 
general thought, the viewer’s atten- 
tion would not still be involved in 
the play while the all-important 
commercial was on. 

Amory watched glumly as his one 
genuine actor delivered a perfectly- 
timed line with true feeling, only to 
have some bumbler squash the ef- 
fect with a hastily-barked response, 
upstaging him to boot. Amory 
called a halt and ran the dialog 
over; the result still offended his 
sense of the symphonic interplay of 
voices that was a well-directed play, 
but he let it pass. No one would 
notice. 

That was the damning part of it : 
no one would notice. The client 
cared only about his commercial 
spots, the playwright was non- 
existent, and the viewers, bless ’em, 
would uncritically accept every- 
thing and anything so long as the 
colors were clear and sharp and 
the sensory effects moving. Nobody 
with any taste or discrimination 
would bother to watch commercial 
video in this year of Grace 2021. 

The show reached its midpoint 
climax and coasted into the mush 
calculated to yank the viewer out 
of the plot and prepare him psy- 
chologically for the curtain. Amory 
made no attempt to direct at this 
point; he relaxed, letting the actors 
fumble through the lines any way 
they pleased. It might cost him his 
job to make these pages vivid and 
interesting, if the client’s Product- 
Intensity Rating should drop three 

7 



AND THE WALLS CAME TUMBLING DOWN 




percentage points the next week. 

The last line of Act One ap- 
peared, weak and flat and lifeless, 
and Amory signalled for a cut-out 
and a ten-minute break. Stepping 
down from his perch, he looked 
around and saw a little clump of 
onlookers watching from the back 
of the studio: Kavanagh, the head 
of the Scripting Committee, Van 
Graben, the network’s Vice-Presi- 
dent in charge of Dramatic Presen- 
tations, and a couple of others, in- 
cluding a roly-poly little man in a 
checked shirt and blazing red trou- 
sers, whom Amory recognized as 
the Client’s Representative. He 
walked over to them. 

“Well, gentlemen? Any opin- 
ions?” 

“Brilliant, John, simply brilliant,” 
Graben said immediately. “That 
thing really moved me. When Lois 
came out with that line — ‘Let’s just 
be friends . forever, Martin ’ — I 
shook, John. I positively shook!” 

“Glad you like it,” Amory said. 
He had shaken at that line too — for 
different reasons. “But let’s give 
credit where credit’s due. To Dave, 
here, and his magnificent scripting 
job.” This kind of talk comes easy 
to me, he thought sourly. I should 
have been an actor instead of a di- 
rector. 

Dave Kavanagh was a short, 
blockily-built, intense man with 
closecropped sandy hair and a 
harsh, acne-pocked face. He smiled 
bleakly. “I’ll just have to pass the 
buck to my committee boys, John. 
You’re the only man in this outfit 
who takes solo credit — or blame. 
Half a dozen men are responsible 
for that script you’re doing.” His 

8 



voice dropped to a confidential 
whisper. “I can tell you we worked 
like dogs over it, too. What a 
stinker that guy Norris turned in!” 

“Nourse,” Amory corrected auto- 
matically. He felt sick. Ten thou- 
sand a week, he thought mechan- 
ically. That’s all that keeps me here . 
1 may be selling my soul, but I’m 
getting a damned fine price for it. 

Graben, the network man, smiled 
warmly at the Client’s Representa- 
tive. “We haven’t heard your opin- 
ion, Mr. Jaberson. I hope you’re en- 
joying this presentation, heh-heh.” 

“I like it,” Jaberson said simply. 

1 like it. The ultimate accolade, 
Amory thought. 

“If you’ll excuse me,” he said. 
“Time for Act Two now.” 

Act Two went slowly. Amory had 
long ago decided never to slack 
off. He tried to do the best job 
he could no matter how hollow the 
script, how undemanding the view- 
ers. That was the only way to re- 
tain a shred of self-dignity, to keep 
from sliding entirely off into the 
commercialized muck that was 
American entertainment, mass- 
media variety. He wondered what 
entertainment was like in the other 
countries of the world. 

Probably much the same, he 
thought. People were much the 
same, despite the artificial political 
barriers that kept each power- 
sphere walled off from the others. 
And video in the USSR or in the 
Federated Empire of Latin- America 
or in the Oriental People’s Republic 
was probably on a par with ours. 

He drove his actors relentlessly 
through the windup of the play, 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 




satisfied if they understood every 
tenth direction he gave, and finally 
it was over. He signalled to the 
technicians that he had finished, 
and the actors under the merciless 
lights relaxed visibly. 

“A great job, all of you,” he 
made himself say. “We’ll triple our 
ratings. You’re all aces; Stanislavski 
would have been proud of you.” 
He mopped sweat from his fore- 
head, folded the shooting script 
neatly down its center, and dropped 
it into the red cloth seat of his 
directorial chair; the charwomen 
could have it now. He was through 
with Mist of Desire . Tomorrow 
night the show would go on, 
botched and crude as always, and 
the viewers would love it, the tele- 
fax critics would hail him as the 
greatest director of the age, and the 
client and the ad agency would 
count their money and rejoice. And 
come Thursday there would be a 
new script, fresh from the anony- 
mous hacks of Kavanagh’s Script- 
ing Committee, full of enthusiastic 
marginal notes from various vice- 
presidents who were always afraid 
Amory might miss the point of the 
pby. 

The cameras retreated into their 
hiding-places; the cast vanished to- 
ward the dressing-rooms. Amory 
looked at the time. Nine-oh-five. An 
hour from now he’d be at Ted 
Beckett’s place, among people. Peo- 
ple who shared his distaste for the 
mass media, even though some of 
them were capable, as he was, of 
doublethink, and could take the 
big video money while retching 
in private over their work. 

The little group in the back of 



the studio had left. Amory was re- 
lieved at that. Some day, he knew, 
Van Graben was going to invite 
him out for a beer after a rehearsal, 
and he was going to blurt out, 
“Sorry, Van. I’m going up to visit 
that subversive Ted Beckett, who’s 
showing some avant-garde films to- 
night, and we’re going to sit around 
cursing you and your whole filthy 
breed.” 

And the next day there’d be a 
stiff little note from the Network 
Head Himself in his mailbox, along 
with a month’s severance pay. 

Amory smiled to himself, won- 
dering whether that would really 
be a fate worse than death or not. 
Beckett and others had often urged 
him to leave his profession before 
it was too late, before his taste and 
the keen edge of his mind suc- 
cumbed to the all-devouring influ- 
ences about him. “Not just yet,” 
Amory would say, even though his 
five years in the industry had left 
him a wealthy man. He realized 
that he was afraid to resign — that 
this job, loathsome as it was, gave 
him his one contact with the mind- 
less majority around him, a contact 
he feared to break. 

He could always break it, and live 
in a cellar like Ted Beckett, never 
knowing when his neighbors would 
tire of having an avowed egghead 
in the neighborhood and come 
crashing in to destroy his books 
and tapes and film projector. This 
way, Amory had status in the com- 
munity: John Amory, the noted 
video director. No one inquired 
about his private feelings. His lofty 
position in the industry provided a 
mask for his inner discontent. 



AND THE WALLS CAME TUMBLING DOWN 



9 




He was not anxious to lose that 
mask. 

Amory shouldered his way 
through the studio, taking advan- 
tage of his size and rank to push 
the thronging technicians aside. 
Once someone stopped him and 
muttered, “Great show tonight, 
John” in his face. 

“Thanks,” Amory said, and kept 
on going — realizing only later that 
the man had been some high net- 
work executive, who probably now 
was fuming over Amory’s haughti- 
ness. Well, the man would forget 
by morning; these network people 
had long since had their brains 
addled by their work, in which they 
believed sincerely. They couldn’t 
remember an insult long enough to 
bear a grudge. 

He reached the elevators, rode 
down, and stepped out into the 
night. It was a warm April evening, 
moonless, slightly overcast. The 
street was virtually empty of pedes- 
trians, though a steady low hum- 
ming told him that the roadway 
fifty feet above the street was 
thronged with cars threading their 
way through New York and out 
into the outlying suburbs; late-shift 
workers heading to their homes in 
Connecticut and New Jersey and 
the Long Island slums. 

A flickering sign around the 
gleaming chrome tower of the Han- 
ley Building caught his attention. 
He waited patiently through four 
leagues of baseball scores, and heard 
the weather forecast : rainfall sched- 
uled for a fifteen-minute drop at 
two-thirty A.M. Otherwise, nothing 
much new. He wondered briefly 
how it had been in the old days, 

10 



when the newsbands had been full 
of international tensions, rumors of 
war, and such things. 

Thanks to the barriers, all was 
tranquil. Russia was so distant she 
might well be on some other world; 
even South America was an alien 
land. Amory wondered whether the 
tranquility had been worth the 
price. 

Then he shook his head. Won- 
dering was a bad habit; it led to 
thoughtfulness, and that was dan- 
gerous. He sighed and looked 
around for a transport depot. He 
wanted to get to Beckett’s place 
early. 

B eckett lived on 255th 

Street, far to the north in the 
blotchy district of crowded tene- 
ments that was Riverdale. About 
the o/ily thing lower than living in a 
cellar apartment in Riverdale was 
to dwell in the rabbit-warrens of 
Levittown or one of the other jam- 
packed towns on the Island, all 
blurred together in one endless mass 
of slum buildings but each still 
strenuously maintaining its ancient 
identity nonetheless. 

Amory caught a cab to Yonkers, 
riding the slim graceful teardrop up 
the silent broad Manhattan Over- 
way, cutting off into the Ninety- 
Sixth Street Overpass and shooting 
up the West Side Drive into Yon- 
kers at a hundred fifty miles an 
hour. Amory relaxed, leaning back 
in the cab as far as his safety-belt 
would allow, confident that the 
driver, operating the car by remote 
control from the main transport 
switching center under the Hud- 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 




son, would get him to his destina- 
tion safely and swiftly. 

Once across the city line into 
Yonkers he stopped the cab, fed a 
bill into the meter and waited for 
his change, and got out. A drop- 
shaft took him quickly to the pedes- 
trian level. Clouds hung low over 
the area; pedestrians moved quick- 
ly to their homes, not lingering. 
Despite atmosphere control, there 
was something stale and unpleasant 
about the air up here; the odor of 
rotting garbage hit his nostrils as 
he walked back across the city line 
into Riverdale. Probably some of 
the local inhabitants had roughed 
up a garbage-collector the day be- 
fore, and in revenge there had been 
no collection today. These things 
happened. 

He followed a circuitous route 
across and back Riverdale Avenue 
until he reached the turnoff that 
led to Beckett’s place. He rang 
twice upstairs, feeling as always the 
sense of participating in something 
forbidden, and headed downstairs 
to Beckett’s apartment. 

Beckett himself met him at the 
door. He was a slim, tired-looking 
little man with faded blue-green 
eyes and a high forehead; once, he 
had been a script writer for a video 
network, but he had never learned 
the successful man’s trick of sub- 
merging his individuality, and he 
had been sacked after a while. He 
had managed to save a few hun- 
dred thousand of his salary, even 
after taxes, and now, jobless and 
alone, he lived off his accumulated 
backlog. 

“Good to see you again, John. 
Gome on in. There’s a fair-sized 



crowd here already.” 

Amory followed him into the 
dimly-lit apartment which had last 
been painted around the turn of 
the century. He saw three or four 
little groups of argumentative men, 
most of them clutching drinkflasks 
and waving them to punctuate 
their words. Among those he recog- 
nized were Nourse, Matt Viglan of 
the Author’s League, fellow director 
Hersch Kyman of Hollywood, and 
two or three other present and 
former mass-media men. 

He grinned at Nourse, who im- 
mediately detached himself from 
the group he was in and came over, 
towing in his wake a tall, stoop- 
shouldered young man Amory had 
never seen before. 

“How’d the show go?” Nourse 
asked. 

“Miserably. The brass loved it. 
Kavanagh dislocated an arm clap- 
ping himself on the back.” 

“My check’s in the bank,” Nourse 
said. “John, I want you to meet 
Gill Hadafield. He’s an esper.” 

At the last word, Amory started 
suddenly and squinted at the tall 
young man. He was at least six-six, 
Amory thought, topping his own 
height by at least two inches. His 
eyes were mildly green, dream- 
clouded, as if he were simulta- 
neously here and in contact with 
someone on the far side of the 
moon. His clothing was threadbare. 

“Gill, this is John Amory, the 
famous video director. You don’t 
watch video much, do you?” 

“No,” Hadafield said in an im- 
possibly gentle voice, so soft it 
seemed feathery. “It’s bad for the 
mind and soul. But I’ve heard your 

11 



AND THE WALLS CAME TUMBLING DOWN 




name, Mr. Amory. Often.” 

“I can’t say the same for you, I 
guess. Espers don’t get much pub- 
licity.” 

“We don’t seek it,” Hadafield 
said. He shifted his feet nervously. 
“And it may seem contradictory of 
me to answer your next question 
before you’ve asked it, but no, I’m 
not reading your mind. I can’t. I’m 
a long-range linker, not a reader. 
But that’s the first question anyone 
ever asks me, so — you know.” 

Amory chuckled. “Of course.” 
He felt vaguely uncomfortable in 
the esper’s presence, and was some- 
what annoyed at Nourse for having 
brought about this awkward con- 
versation. He used his drinklessness 
as an excuse to break away and 
head for the kitchen. 

There he found a drinkflask of 
beer, ^squeezed it open, and drank. 
A collection box lay open nearby. 
Ostensibly it was there simply to 
cover costs of drinks for the eve- 
ning, since there was no reason why 
Beckett should have to stand the 
expense — but, in actuality, though 
no one mentioned the fact openly, 
the box was for Beckett’s support. 
Amory covertly slipped a hundred- 
doilar bill from his roll and slid it 
into the box. Beckett went to great 
risk to secure these films ; it was only 
fair to help him along. 

He returned to the main room. 
The wall-speaker was playing Bar- 
tok’s Fourth Quartet — the original 
score, he realized happily, not the 
revised 1999 edition with the dis- 
sonances carefully smoothed out 
and a couple of cellos added to 
give the piece “body.” Beckett had 
evidently found a copy of the un- 

12 



tinkered score somewhere, and fed 
it to his synthesizer. 

Amory felt warm and loose. He 
was ordinarily a distant and aloof 
man, but here in Beckett’s dingy 
cellar he found himself among 
friends, men of taste who shared 
his interests. It was good to know 
you were not the only one who 
could listen to unrevised 20th Cen- 
tury music without frothing at the 
mouth; it was comforting to see 
others admiring the Picasso prints 
on the wall, the incredibly rare sets 
of Joyce and Kafka in the book- 
shelves. The fact that Beckett left 
those books out in the open was a 
compliment to his guests : lesser 
men, unable to comprehend the 
books but well aware of their worth, 
might be tempted to steal them. 

Amory drifted into a discussion 
that seemed shaped for him: the 
place of drama among the arts. A 
stocky earnest- looking man who 
wrote ad copy during the day was 
saying, “In a sense drama’s a more 
purified art than the novel. It’s less 
didactic. A novelist has the chance 
to stop the story, to moralize, to 
comment on what’s happening ; the 
dramatist gives you only the sheer 
moment, just the action and the 
words, welling up out of people 
right before you. The moralizing is 
all submerged in the structure of 
the play. That’s not easy.” 

“I’ll go along with that,” said a 
pale hawk-faced man in bright blue. 
“But what do you make of the 
theater of Brecht, for example, then. 
Intermingling — ” 

“Impure drama. He admitted it 
himself.” 

“Esthetically barbarous,” said 
ROBERT SILVERBERG 




someone else. “But yet it makes its 
effect despite the mixture of tech- 
niques. What do you think, John? 
You’re the only practicing director 
among us.” 

Amory scowled pleasantly and 
said, “I wish you wouldn’t remind 
me of the stuff I turn out for my 
daily caviar. The trash I direct 
would be hooted off a 19th-century 
stage. But I’m generally in agree- 
ment with — ” 

He spoke confidently and enthu- 
siastically, knowing he was an au- 
thority on his subject and knowing 
also that this was the only audience 
he was likely to find for his theories. 
The discussion went on some min- 
utes; then Ted Beckett called for 
attention, asking everyone to take 
seats for the film showing. 

Amory found Nourse at his el- 
bow. The wiry playwright glanced 
at Amory's drinkflask and said, 
“What are you drinking?” 

“Beer. What else?” 

“You ought to try some of this 
stuff. It’s genuine German wine, 
slipped in by a friend of Beckett’s 
through Gape Hatteras. There isn’t 
enough of it to go around, but he 
wants a few people to try some.” 
Amory glanced at the glass 
Nourse handed him. He sipped the 
white wine. It was dry, faintly bit- 
ter. As he finished the glass he felt 
sudden vertigo, but shook it off. 
The mixture of beer and wine 
wasn’t a healthy one. 

Nourse was peering earnestly up 
at him. “Well?” 

“Fine stuff,” Amory said. “Fine. 
We’d better go get seats.” 

They found two chairs near the 
back of the room. 



Beckett unrolled a glittering pris- 
matic screen and retired to a dark 
recess in the back of the room. “Will 
you douse the lights?” he asked. 

The lights were doused. He 
snapped on the projector. 

The film was something called 
The Oceans Are Wide. It was Eng- 
lish-made, and the print was poor 
quality, flickering and yellowing 
here and there. Amory watched, 
fascinated, as the film unreeled. 

He thought of the slogan of his 
drama hour: Real People and their 
Real Problems in the World of To- 
day. It sounded fine, but in practice 
it worked out to piffling vacuities 
about small-minded average-type 
folks, and the result was a sort of 
gentle happy-ending fantasy several 
leagues removed from any reality 
Amory knew. 

This film was different. It had 
been made with more honesty than 
skill, more sincerity than craft. But 
the story it unfolded was real , in 
the truest sense; Amory found his 
emotions and intellect completely 
absorbed. He was fascinated, too, 
by the almost alien rhythms of the 
players’ speech. The gulf of the 
Atlantic was as a gap between 
worlds, in these days when all in- 
ternational commerce and com- 
munication was rigidly banned. The 
twin languages of English and 
American were diverging rapidly; 
Amory could foresee a time when it 
would be necessary to outfit each 
film out of England with subtitles, 
as was done when Beckett showed a 
French or an Italian film. 

After a while he forgot his sur- 
roundings, the peeling walls and the 
stink of garbage outside, the hoot- 

13 



AND' THE WALLS CAME TUMBLING DOWN 




ing of gangs in the distant streets, 
even the people beside him and the 
faint hum of the projector. The 
only reality was on the screen. 

This was what had been lost, he 
thought. Somewhere in the great 
American levelling-off process, the 
spark of artistic originality had been 
buried under a gush of advertising 
and formulas. Men were not 
created equal — and to aim every 
play, every film at the lowest com- 
mon denominator was to destroy 
anything higher, by a sort of cul- 
tural Gresham’s Law. 

He sank into a mood of uncon- 
trollable bitterness, conscious that it 
was spoiling his enjoyment of the 
film. He fought it, without success. 

And suddenly a wave of dizziness 
rippled through him. 

The wine, he thought. I should 
never — 

His head swam. The image on 
the screen quivered, melted, spun 
in an impossible circle. Sweat 
bathed him ; he could no longer see. 

What’s happening to me? he 
wondered. He was angry that he 
should get sick in the middle of such 
a fine film; he would never get an- 
other chance to see it. Then the 
anger faded, replaced by fear. He 
was a strong, healthy man. This 
kind of attack had never hit him 
before. 

He rose unsteadily to his feet; he 
had to get to the washroom, had to 
have a drink of water, had to splash 
his face with cold water to stop the 
burning. Someone behind him mut- 
tered, and he realized that his body 
was probably eclipsing the screen. 
He ducked, hoping he was no long- 
er blocking the beam. 

14 



Oddly, he had difficulty putting 
his feet on the floor; they kept 
wanting to float up behind him, it 
seemed. He took three wobbly steps. 
Then, quite gently, he started to fall 
forward on his face, and, not so 
gently, landed, striking the edge of 
his jaw against the cold wood of 
the floor. 

He blinked away the first lash of 
pain, but that was all. Still not 
comprehending, he slipped into un- 
consciousness. 

He woke slowly, almost in sec- 
tions. The first layer of his mind 
that returned to consciousness was 
that part that had been meshed in 
the film; he looked in vain for the 
screen. He realized after that that 
he was no longer in Beckett’s apart- 
ment, and still later that he had 
been taken somewhere else, and 
quite probably deliberately drugged. 

Drugged? Who would — 

He blinked and looked around. 
Quite definitely he was no longer 
anywhere in Riverdale; the clean 
freshness of the high-roofed room 
told him that at once. It was a big 
room, with a sphincter-entrance at 
the far end; he lay stretched full 
length on a bare pallet, and on a 
chair nearby someone had neatly 
spread out his jacket and tie. His 
shoes were on the floor at his side. 

A desk near the window was the 
next thing he saw; it was littered 
with papers, documents perhaps. 
The wall was gentle green in color; 
the floor was covered with yellow 
foam. Amory sat up, shaking his 
head experimentally. He still felt 
fairly calm. 

He groped for his shoes and 
ROBERT SILVERBERG 




slipped into them. The foam floor- 
covering was springy and yielding 
as he walked across it. 

He went first to the window, but 
it had been opaqued and there was 
no sign of the polarizing controls. 
He saw nothing but gray blankness. 
He might be almost anywhere. 

Quickly, feeling the first quivers 
of alarirt, he ran to the sphincter- 
door, but it too had no control. He 
groped over its cool metal surface, 
hoping to find some way of letting 
himself out, without success. 

A voice muttered suddenly, “He’s 
awake.” 

Another voice, deeper and more 
resonant, said, “Please don’t be up- 
set, Mr. Amory. You won’t come to 
any harm.” 

He whirled and glanced behind 
him. “Who said that?” 

“We’re monitoring you from out- 
side.” He saw a speaker cone 
mounted in the ceiling, from which 
the voice was emanating. 

“What kind of joke is this?” 
Amory demanded hoarsely. “The 
penalties for kidnapping are — ” 

“Very stringent. But I think 
you’ll be willing to work with 
us. Please don’t make judgements 
in advance of knowledge, Mr. 
Amory.” 

He forced himself to remain very 
calm. Here 1 am, he thought, locked 
into a practically bare room , having 
been drugged and kidnapped, car- 
rying on a eonversation with an in- 
visible captor. 

Kavanagh’s Scripting Committee 
would have turned the situation 
down for potential use on his show ; 
such things didn’t happen to Real 
People in the World of Today. Ex- 



cept when they did happen, Amory 
thought. 

“Cut the monitor off,” he heard 
the first voice say, just barely audi- 
bly and not to him. “Go in and talk 
to him.” 

Amory lifted his jacket from the 
chair, slipped into it, and sat down 
to wait. A few moments later, the 
sphincter-door began to iris open. 
He caught a fragmentary glimpse 
of a brightly-lit corridor behind, 
and several figures standing in it. 
Someone entered ; the sphincter 
closed. 

“I’ll have to apologize for our 
method of getting you here, Mr. 
Amory. You were recommended 
most highly to us, but the person 
who recommended you suggested 
that you be brought here unknow- 
ing, or else you might not come at 
all. Briefly, we’re not going to be 
on Earth very long, and while we’re 
here we’d like to employ your serv- 
ices.” 

Amory said nothing. He was 
staring at the man who spoke, and 
wondering what there had been in 
the drink Nourse had given him. 
He narrowed his eyes, moistened 
his lips. 

The speaker was a man of his 
own height, perhaps a little taller. 
He wore clinging, rubbery-looking 
skintight clothes that outlined a 
firmly-muscled body. What there 
was exposed of his skin was an even 
dark-blue in color. 

He had no hair. His head was 
dotted with stubby little projections 
perhaps a quarter of an inch high 
and half an inch apart. He had no 
eyebrows. Between his two cold, 
intense eyes, set slightly above 

15 



AND THE WALLS CAME TUMBLING DOWN 




them, was a third eye, unwinking, 
equally cold and intense. 

The creature smiled, showing 
glossy black teeth. 

“Where did you come from?” 
Amory asked, in a hushed half- 
whisper. 

“The stars,” said the stranger, 
with a flat, even inflection that im- 
plied there was nothing at all ex- 
traordinary about such a statement. 



MORY LET THOSE bald 
words soak in, regarding them 
as some sort of joke, some prank. 
He said in a flat quiet voice, “The 
stars. That’s very funny, you 
know?” But by the time he was 
through saying it he was not so 
sure it was funny. A cold band of 
fear gripped his middle. 

“Just where are you from?” he 
asked, eyeing the totally alien fea- 
tures. 

“What I said was the truth. Is it 
that difficult to absorb, Mr. 
Amory?” 

“One doesn’t expect such things. 
All right: I’ll provisionally accept 
that you just blew in from the Crab 
Nebula, or wherever. What do you 
want with me?” 

“Your help. Your guidance.” The 
alien touched one hand — a web- 
fingered hand, Amory now noticed 
— lightly to his scalp. “You’re a 
connoisseur of the arts, aren’t you? 
A lover of books and poetry, paint- 
ing, the drama. The drama par- 
ticularly.” 

“What if I am?” Amory asked 
cautiously. 

“That makes you a very unusual 
man, you know. We’ve been on 



Earth a while ; we’ve shopped 
around. We chose you as the man 
most likely to help us. In brief, 
we’re looking for a guide to the best 
of Earth’s culture — someone who’ll 
tell us what’s considered good and 
what isn’t, someone to separate the 
wheat from the chaff, the pure from 
the dross, the artistic from the — 
kitsch , is that the word? We’d like 
to take examples of Earth’s best 
cultural products back to our home 
world. Duplicates, of course; we 
have reproducing equipment.” 
Amory began to be more in- 
terested. “And you want me to say, 
Take Mozart and leave movie- 
music, take Shaw but not Sardou, 
take Bertrand Russell but not Her- 
bert Spencer. Something like that?” 
“To a certain extent. We’ll also 
want a sampling of the less deserv- 
ing art and philosophy — a judi- 
ciously-selected sample. We’d want 
Spencer, for instance; he had his 
influence, and he was important in 
his day. You see?” 

“I think so.” 

“We thought you would.” 

“How come you need a — a na- 
tive guide, though,” Amory said. 
“Couldn’t you discover these things 
for yourself, in time?” 

“Possibly; possibly not. But we 
don’t have time on our side. A few 
months, perhaps a year, then we 
must be going. There are always 
other worlds to visit. So many other 
worlds, Mr. Amory; you have no 
idea.” 

Suddenly Amory reddened. 
“You’re a sort of anthropologist, 
aren’t you? Collecting primitive 
artifacts? You’ll take our finest art 
and stick it in a museum like an 




16 



ROBERT SILVERBERG 




Alaskan totem-mask, and smile 
patronizingly at it?” 

The alien’s face remained fixed 
in its affable grin, but the three 
dark eyes grew faintly grim. “You 
may think of our mission that way, 
or in any other way you please. We 
prefer to take a happier view. Earth 
is quite an unusual world ; we want 
a generous sampling of her finest 
work. You’ll find many rewards in 
working with us, both materially 
and otherwise. But I don’t want you 
to rush your decision. I’ll leave you 
alone to think about it for a while. 
When you’ve made up your mind 
you can signal to me by pressing 
this stud at the side of the desk — 
oh—” / 

The alien blinked suddenly, as if 
seeing the heap of documents on 
the desk for the first time, and 
crossed the room quickly. He 
gathered the sheaf of papers into 
his arms, saying, “Unimportant pa- 
pers. Sloppy to leave them lying 
around.” 

One yellow-green slip of paper 
slid from the bundle in the alien’s 
arms, spiralled behind him to the 
floor, and slid under the lambent 
plastic of the desk. Amory caught 
the sight from the comer of one 
eye, but thoughtfully said nothing 
about it. The alien was at the 
sphincter-door, clutching the rest 
of the papers. 

“I’ll give it some thought,” 
Amory said. He moistened his lips. 
“I’ll signal when I’m ready.” 

“Very good.” 

The sphincter opened and closed 
in a fraction of a second, and in 
the interval between opening and 



closing the alien stepped nimbly 
through, leaving Amory once again 
a prisoner and alone. The first hard 
wave of post-reflexive shock went 
shuddering through him, and then 
he reasserted his normal control. 

He stood for a while at the blank 
waxy-surfaced opaqued window, 
staring at his own dim reflection. 
He was willing now to accept every- 
thing: that there were aliens among 
us, that the creature he had just 
spoken with had indeed come from 
some other star, that they were en- 
gaged in some kind of cultural col- 
lecting-tour here on Earth. Despite 
the melodramatic circumstances in 
which he had been brought in con- 
tact with them, he was ready to be- 
lieve what he had just seen and 
heard. 

It shook his inward calm to know 
that Earth was just a way-station in 
the sky where cosmic artifact-col- 
lectors might stop off for a year or 
so on their way to Arcturus VII or 
Procyon X. Yet he had foreseen it, 
in a way, and there was nothing in 
his personal philosophy that held 
that mankind was the highest form 
of life conceivable. He had had 
enough experience with mankind to 
know its shortcomings. 

An early dream of his, still un- 
fulfilled, was to see man reach the 
Moon, the planets, the stars. They 
said it was theoretically possible, 
but nothing had ever come of it. 
Perhaps if war had come eighty 
years ago, instead of solidifying 
into a perpetual deep-freeze, space 
travel might have been realized. 
But war had not come, and the 
cold war had become an eternally 
frozen peace instead, each power- 

17 



AND THE WALLS CAME TUMBLING DOWN 




sphere locked behind its own 
boundaries and all external com- 
munication voided. 

So they reached us first , he 
thought. 

He sighed heavily and crossed the 
room to the shining plastic-topped 
desk. They wanted his help, he 
thought. That was certainly flatter- 
ing. Naturally, they’d demand he 
remain perfectly silent about their 
presence on Earth until they were 
gone, and possibly even afterward. 
That was easily understandable. 
And Amory would not mind such 
a restriction. He had never been 
overflowing with love for humanity 
— at least, not the noisy filthy hu- 
manity that flooded America’s cities 
till they burst at the seams, the race 
of marching morons that was now 
a-breeding and who hated Amory’s 
kind as much as he hated them. He 
felt no obligation to tell the world 
about the aliens in their midst. He 
might almost enjoy his secret knowl- 
edge. 

His hand crept to the enamelled 
buzzer-stud at the side of the desk. 
One swift muscular contraction and 
he would summon the alien. 

Amory paused ; and in that pause, 
his eye caught the yellow-green 
edge of the paper the alien had 
dropped, protruding an inch or two 
from beneath the desk where it had 
fallen. Amory decided to postpone 
calling the alien a minute or two. 

He started to reach for the pa- 
per; then, remembering that he 
most probably was being monitored 
on an outside circuit, chose a dif- 
ferent tack. He groaned as if in 
deep inner conflict, buried his head 
in his hands, slumped forward on 



the desk in apparent perplexity. 

The desktop was translucent. 
With great care he worked the sheet 
of paper out of its hiding-place with 
the toe of his shoe, and tugged it 
across the floor to a point directly 
beneath his face. He stared through 
the desktop at it. 

And slowly his face grew pale. 
The document was in English, 
though it had been typed in a 
curiously ornate face unlike any 
Amory had ever seen. The words 
were easily visible. 

It said: 

TO: Gargh 
FROM: Kress 

REFERENCE: 8H42, as under- 
stood 

Your report received and en- 
tered. So far all is well, for which 
we are very grateful here, since 
there was some doubt in Ruling 
Body’s mind concerning the 
validity of the Earth expedition. 

Receipt of your report has 
caused favorable comment in 
high places, and there is general 
approval of your policy. We all 
agree that it’s wise to gather as 
many of Earth’s cultural out- 
pourings as possible in the year 
remaining before invasion-time; 
we can then manipulate Council 
sympathies to show that we began 
as an unwarlike enterprise, but 
found it necessary for Galactic 
peace to cleanse Earth of its 
population. This despite any fa- 
vorable impression the gathered 
artworks might create. Besides 
which, it would be thoughtless to 
let an entire culture vanish from 



18 



ROBERT SILVERBERG 




existence without keeping some 
mementoes. 

We are in receipt of the psych 
reports on John Amory and Fili- 
mon Grigorescu, and agree with 
your preliminary guess that they 
would be ideal. The Rumanian 
particularly shows the character- 
istics you could best employ. 

We’re still awaiting the geo- 
logical report on the planet. The 
actual invasion is still in the plan- 
ning stage, but of course we’re 
anxious to avoid any actual 
damage to the world itself, since 
then it would lose all value as 

The message ended there, as if 
it were continued on some second 
sheet that the alien had not been 
thoughtful enough to leave behind. 
But Amory had seen enough. 

He read the sheet through care- 
fully twice more, until the amiably 
chilling words were as deeply em- 
bedded in his memory as any 
Shakespearean soliloquy, all with- 
out moving from his head-in-hands 
position on the desk. Sweat dripped 
from his forehead; a dull premoni- 
tory ache began in his stomach and 
spread its way upward through his 
heart and lungs into his throat. He 
felt sick. 

. necessary for Galactic peace 
to cleanse Earth of its popula- 
tion . 

The cool friendly phrases danced 
before him. So they reached us first, 
he thought. And how! 

After a while he grew calm — 
numb, rather. Panic reactions were 
fine on occasions, but not now. He 
was in possession of data on a gi- 
gantic conspiracy, he alone, and if 

AND THE WALLS CAME TUMBLING 



he maneuvered shrewdly enough 
there might yet be a way out. 

He nudged the slip of paper back 
out of sight beneath the foot of the 
desk. 

This is the invasion vanguard, he 
thought dully. The scavengers com- 
ing in to grab whatever 3 s worth 
keeping, before they blot Earth out . 

And somehow I stumbled into it 
all. 

Slowly he raised his head. He ad- 
dressed himself as if he were both 
the director on the podium and the 
actor under the merciless lights, in- 
structing himself in just the proper 
way to sit, creating a mask of outer 
calm on his troubled face, bringing 
color back into his cheeks. He had 
long felt that only great actors could 
exert actual physical control over 
themselves during a performance, 
but that a great director could bring 
out latent greatness in almost any- 
one. 

Now was the test. He took a deep 
breath, temporarily wiped his new 
knowledge from his minc^ and 
jammed down fiercely on the signal 
stud. 

The alien entered. He still wore 
the pleasant smile, but a deeper 
strength lurked in the three cold 
eyes. Amory realized he had been 
fooled himself by a master actor 
into thinking the aliens’ presence on 
Earth was strictly benevolent. 

He would have to play his role 
with great care. If the aliens dis- 
covered he knew their true motives, 
they’d dispose of him on the spot. 
Whatever they were planning, it 
was more important to them than 
John Amory’s life.

“I’ve been thinking over your 
proposition,” he said conversation- 
ally. “I don’t know as I like it so 
much.” 

The alien looked grieved. “What 
are your objections, then?” 

Frowning, Amory said, “First of 
all, what’s in it for me? Me, per- 
sonally.” 

“Anything you like. Wealth. 
Copies of the books you secure for 
us. We can be very helpful that 
way.” 

Amory nodded. “That sounds 
good. But two : how do I know 
you’re acting in good faith?” 
“What do you mean by that?” 
“Well, suppose you’re planning 
to make away with our most price- 
less art treasures as soon as I point 
them out to you. Suppose you’re 
not planning to take duplicates 
back with you, but the actual 
originals? In that case I’d hate to 
be the man who led you on.” 

“I could give you my word we 
have no such intentions. Does that 
convince you?” 

Your word means a lot , Amory 
thought bitterly. Out loud he said, 
“No, but I’ll have to accept it.” 
“Any further objections?” 

“Some. For one thing, I don’t 
even know your name, or where 
you’re from. I hate working for 
phantoms. And lastly, I want you to 
understand that I’m employed, and 
my work will have to come first. 
Whatever time I devote to this . 
project of yours, it will be spare 
time only.” 

“Very well. We anticipated such 
a request, and we’ll honor it. As for 
where we’re from, I’ll say only that 
it’s a star in the Lesser Magellanic 

20 



Cluster, as I think you refer to it; 
there isn’t much point in telling 
you which one, is there? There are 
so many.” 

Amory shrugged. “Granted. You 
must have instantaneous spacedrive, 
then. Or else you don’t mind a 
twenty or thirty thousand year trip 
across space to collect a few sym- 
phonies and paintings.” 

“We have instantaneous drive,” 
the alien said calmly. 

“You didn’t tell me your name,” 
Amory pointed out. 

“My name? How unimportant, 
really! But you call me Cargh, if 
you wish. Just Cargh; the numbers 
are a bore. Is everything settled, 
then?” 

Amory forced himself into a re- 
flective mood, as if he were still 
weighing possible alternatives and 
objections, and not as though he 
had chosen a course of action long 
before Cargh had reentered the 
room. 

At length he said, “Okay. I’m 
your man. When do I begin?” 

Cargh’s steady grin grew warmer. 
“Whenever you choose. We don’t 
have a great deal of time, but we 
have enough. First I suppose you’d 
like to know where you are.” 

“That might help,” Amory ad- 
mitted. 

The alien slid his webbed hands 
along the wall near the window, 
and a section of plastic sprang up, 
revealing control-panels under- 
neath. Cargh touched the depolar- 
izer and the film of opacity peeled 
away from the window. 

Bright morning sunlight came 
streaming through. 

“Recognize the territory?” 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 




Amory looked. Even at dawn, 
mid-Manhattan was crowded ; 
early-shift workers rode the Over- 
way far below, a steady stream of 
bright-colored teardrops descending 
on the city from the suburbs. The 
air still looked clean and fresh, but 
the day’s pollution would soon be 
upon it. 

Directly across the way rose the 
glittering column of the Hanley 
Building; facing it was the shining 
chrome needle of Transvideo 
Tower. They were in the very heart 
of Manhattan. 

“I’ll be damned,” Amory said 
wonderingly. “Only in New York 
City could something like this hap- 
pen. I mean having a bunch of 
alien^come down out of the Magel- 
lanic Clouds and set up an office, 
with nobody noticing, nobody car- 
ing. Right here in the middle of 
Manhattan.” 

Cargh was still smiling. “You’re 
not far from your place of work, I 
believe. It’ll be quite convenient for 
you to come here after your video 
chores are finished. This is the 
ninety-third floor of Huxley Gar- 
dens. We’ve rented the entire floor.” 

“I’ll be damned,” Amory said 
again. He was not merely playing 
a role, now; he was genuinely as- 
tonished. 

Cargh re-opaqued the window. 
“We don’t care for your sunlight,” 
he explained. “And things are more 
private this way.” 

“Of course.” 

“I understand today is a day off 
for you,” the alien went on. “We 
wouldn’t want to cut into it any 
more than we’ve already done. 
We’ll get in touch with you tomor- 



row and make further arrange- 
ments. If you’ll come this way — ” 
Cargh led him through a cor- 
ridor, past another sphincter, and 
out into the main hall. “This is as 
far as I can go,” he said. “We never 
venture past that door. But you’ll 
find the dropshaft just beyond.” 
“Thanks,” Amory said. He passed 
through an irising sphincter and 
waved to the vanishing Cargh. The 
neat lettering on the outer skin of 
the sphincter said: 

CARGH & CO. 

By Appointment Only 

That was all. No hint that be- 
hind that shining metal oval lived 
the vanguard of an alien invasion 
force. Amory pressed for the drop- 
shaft and realized his hands were 
shaking almost uncontrollably. He 
wondered when the aliens would 
discover they had accidentally ex- 
posed a vital document, and 
whether they would ever learn he 
had read it. 



A mory reached his home, 

in fashionable Fort Lee just on 
the Jersey side of the Hudson River, 
twenty minutes later, having taken 
a cab up to 110th Street and there 
across the Cathedral Avenue river- 
tube to the Jersey side. He had a 
modest three-room apartment with 
full privacy insulation, on the thir- 
ty-ninth floor of a sharply contoured 
multiple dwelling. It cost him $1000 
a month, and he considered it a 
bargain at that rate. 

He had furnished it handsomely. 
There were ways of circumventing 

21 



AND THE WALLS CAME TUMBLING DOWN 




taxes to some extent, and he had 
drawn his $10,000-a-week check 
from the network long enough to 
be a wealthy man by now. Rich 
carpets covered the floor, providing 
presence for his sound system ; 
pseudowood bookcases occupied 
three walls from floor to ceiling, and 
oriental screens, fabulously rare 
since the People’s Republic had de- 
clared its Non-Intercourse Act and 
cut all of Asia off from contact with 
the hated west, decorated his study. 
Amory lived well. 

He sank into a webfoam chair 
that faced the subtly-hued Tanguy 
original he had bought three years 
back, and dialed a drink: bourbon, 
straight. The first shot was merely 
a bracer; he tossed it down and 
dialed another. Aliens , he thought. 
Invasion force . 

There still was plenty of time. 
But definite plans were taking shape 
in his mind. First, he had to find 
out some things. 

He picked up the phone exten- 
sion and punched out Ted Beckett’s 
number. The phone rang six, seven 
times; then the screen across the 
room brightened and Beckett’s wor- 
ried face appeared, squinting slight- 

ly- 

“Hello, Ted,” Amory said. “I 
wake you up?” 

“I’ve been up a while. Feeling 
better now, John?” 

Amory smiled. “That’s why I’m 
calling. I want some info. Last 
thing I remember, I was watching 
a film at your place. Next I know 
I wake up over here in my own 
bed. I want to know where the hell 
I was in between, and what hap- 
pened to me last night.” 

22 



Beckett said, “You don’t remem- 
ber?” 

“Not a thing. Not a damn thing.” 
“You got sick, right in the middle 
of the film. Got out of your seat 
and staggered halfway across the 
room, and fell flat on your face. 
We couldn’t get you to come round 
for anything, John.” 

“So?” 

“So Lee Nourse took you home 
and got you a doctor, and thatV 
the last I knew until you just called. 
Didn’t they leave a note or any- 
thing?” 

“Not a thing. Someone put me 
to bed, but that’s all I know.” 
“You better call Nourse then,” 
Beckett said. “He can tell you what 
happened after you left here. I 
really don’t know.” Beckett was 
chewing his lip suspiciously; Amory, 
a professionally skilled interpreter 
of such mannerisms, read easily 
that Beckett was lying, but at this 
point there was no need to press 
anything. 

Casually Amory asked, “Before 
I sign off — can you give me the 
number of that esper who was at 
your party? Gill Hadafield, that’s 
his name. I want to talk to him.” 
Again Beckett munched his lip. 
“You better ask Nourse for that 
too. Lee knows the guy; I don’t.” 
“I see. Well, thanks, Ted. Thanks 
anyway.” 

He broke the contact and watch- 
ed Beckett’s harried face vanish 
from the screen. His fingers hovered 
over the dialing stud a moment; he 
was on the verge of dialing Lee 
Nourse when the sudden dull plop 
of the mailchute told him that 
something had arrived. 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 




He rose, opened the door, and 
took in the bulky manila envelope. 
Within was a video script, with a 
covering note from Dave Kavanagh 
that said simply, Here's the script 
for next week's show. 

Amory glanced at it. The mimeo- 
graphed topsheet said, FOLLY 
AND FORTUNE, A Drama In 
Two Acts, by Matthew Viglan. Be- 
neath that came the little rubber- 
stamp that signified Scripting Com- 
mittee approval. He tossed the 
script onto his desk, reflecting that 
there was probably as much of Matt 
Viglan’s work in it as there had 
been of Lee Nourse’s in Mist of 
Desire . The Committee had a way 
of frowning on individual stylistic 
enterprise. 

But it was difficult to think of 
such things as video scripts right 
now. 

He dialed Lee Nourse’s number 
and got Nourse’s wife, a blonde 
tense-looking woman with a shrill 
voice. “Lee’s not home,” she half- 
screamed at him. 

“Where can I find him, then? 
This is John Amory.” 

“Who?” 

“Amory. I directed his last script 
Mist of Desire." He tried to keep 
the annoyance out of his voice. 

“Oh,” she said. “Well, he’s at his 
studio, Mr. Amory. He doesn’t like 
to be disturbed while he works. I 
don’t know if I can give you his 
number — ” 

“That’s all right, Mrs. Nourse,” 
Amory said smoothly. “I already 
have it.” He rang off and dialed the 
other number, leaving her to pro- 
test to a blank screen. 

Nourse took his time about an- 



swering. Amory let the phone ring, 
knowing that the writer would pick 
up sooner or later, and after the 
tenth or eleventh ring he finally 
answered. “Yes?” he snarled angrily 
— and, seeing Amory, softened at 
once. “How do you feel today, 
John?” 

“Puzzled,” Amory said. “I called 
Beckett and he couldn’t tell me 
anything. What the blazes hap- 
pened to me last night at his place?” 

Nourse looked uneasy. “It must 
have been that wine you had, John. 
You conked out in the middle of 
the film. Luckily someone at the 
party was a doctor, and he took a 
look at you and said it was nothing 
serious, just a nervous reaction — 
a fluke thing. So I was elected to 
take you home and put you to bed. 
I was going to call about noon to 
find out how you were, but I guess 
I don’t have to.” 

That was very interesting, Amory 
thought. Beckett hadn’t said any- 
thing about a doctor at the party. 
Already he had found one major 
contradiction in the story, and he 
suspected there would be more. A 
faint twitch of Nourse’s left eyelid 
aroused his suspicions. 

“I’m okay now,” Amory said. 
“I’m not as young as I used to be. 
Say, — you know that esper Hada- 
field you brought with you last 
night?” 

“Y-ess,” Nourse said. 

“I’d like to get in touch with 
him. Do you think you could let 
me have his number?” 

Nourse shook his head. “He 
doesn’t have a phone. He’s a hard 
man to reach.” 

“How do I do it?” asked Amory, 

23 



AND THE WALLS CAME TUMBLING DOWN 




grinning. “With a ouija board?” 

“No, there are better ways. Look 
— how bad do you want to see him, 
John?” 

“Bad bad. I want him to make a 
long-distance pickup for me. To 
Rumania.” 

Again Nourse’ s eyelid twitched 
uncontrollably. But the writer’s 
voice was even as he said, “I guess 
it can be arranged. When do you 
want to see him?” 

“Toward the end of the week. 
Let’s see, now — today’s Wednesday. 
What can you do about Sunday 
afternoon?” 

“I’ll give it a try,” Nourse pro- 
mised. “Call me Saturday for an 
okay.” 

“Will do,” Amory said, and 
signed off. 

He spent the next hour reading 
Folly and Fortune , the new script, 
with the sort of care he might la- 
vish on a newly-discovered Shaw 
comedy. Viglan’s script was a for- 
mula job, difficult to distinguish 
from the one by Nourse that had 
left his hands the day before. Char- 
acters, basic conflict, even the style 
— identical, as might be expected 
from any script produced by the 
committee system. 

Amory read it with care. The 
secret of his success was to take any- 
thing, even trash like this, and treat 
it as if it were an enduring work 
of art, shutting out any outside dis- 
traction as he did so. Aliens from 
the Magellanic Clouds had invaded 
Earth; still, the script had to be 
read. He ploughed grimly past a 
note Van Graben had pencilled in 
on the eleventh page, saying, This 

24 



is a moment of great poignancy . Do 
your best with it, John . Such help- 
fulness had angered him, in the 
beginning; now he scarcely noticed 
the comment. 

He had not quite finished his first 
examination of the script when the 
phone rang. He snapped on his ex- 
tension, but instead of showing a 
caller’s face the screen merely pre- 
sented a swirling pattern of red and 
blue whorls. A bright, impersonal 
voice said, “We have a closed-cir- 
cuit call for Mr. John Amory, per- 
son-to-person. If Mr. Amory is at 
home, will he please signal his 
identity-code?” 

A call of this sort cost a fancy 
figure, even on a local basis. Frown- 
ing curiously, Amory tapped out his 
special code, which only he and the 
phone company knew. After a pause 
came the operator’s acknowledging 
“Go ahead, please,” and the scat- 
ter-pattern on the screen broke. The 
swirling colors reformed into an 
alien face. 

“Good afternoon, Mr. Amory. 
This is Cargh.” 

“What can I do for you?” Amory 
said automatically, studying the 
alien to see if Cargh betrayed any 
suspicious manifestations. But the 
dark blue face showed no outward 
change. 

“I’d like to make our first ap- 
pointment,” Cargh said. “Are you 
free tomorrow?” 

“I’m starting a new show tomor- 
row. How’s Friday?” 

“Friday evening?” 

“Friday afternoon,” Amory said. 
“I could get to your place about 
one, one-thirty. And then I’ll be 
free most of Saturday, too.” 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 




“Very well,” said Cargh. “We 
can expect you Friday afternoon, 
then? Between one and one-thirty.” 

“I’ll be there.” 

The screen blanked without an- 
other word from the alien. Amory 
had been unable to read the alien’s 
face, but it did not seem to him 
that Cargh’s attitude had changed 
since the last time they had spoken. 
They still did not know Amory had 
seen the document. 

Unless, of course, they were pre- 
paring a trap. 

He threw himself into his work 
with a sort of desperate energy, 
plunging deep into the problems of 
staging Folly and Fortune as if that 
could keep his mind from Cargh 
and the memorandum he had acci- 
dentally been permitted to read. 

The part Nourse and Beckett 
played in this affair troubled him, 
too. Obviously, they hadn’t told 
him the whole truth, or anything 
near the whole truth, about what 
had been done to him at that party. 
He had deliberately been drugged 
and turned over to the aliens — by 
whom? 

He felt suddenly cold. What if 
all of them — Nourse and Beckett 
and Viglan and that esper too — 
were in the pay of the aliens, or 
otherwise under sway? Plainly there 
had been a plot to turn him over to 
Cargh; who knew what lay behind 
that plot? Discontented intellectu- 
als so tired of the world they were 
willing to hand it over to the Mag- 
ellanics without strings? 

Maybe. Ted Beckett and Lee 
Nourse were embittered, unhappy 
men. Amory easily could see them 

AND THE WALLS CAME TUMBLING 



doing something like this, as a wild 
means of revenge against the world 
that had no use for their talents. 

He shook his head and turned 
again to the script, and immediately 
intrigue and revenge faded from 
his mind. By some curious process 
of inversion the puerile script came 
to glowing life as he read it, until 
each character occupied a definite 
niche in his mind, firmly-rounded, 
vivid, bright with individuation, 
while Beckett and Nourse and 
Cargh faded to the status of card- 
board figures in a Hollywood melo- 
drama. Amory worked at this level 
of intensity until the bonging of the 
autochef told him it was dinner- 
time ; he chewed chlorella steak 
with protoid syrup mechanically, 
downed his caffeine-drink unknow- 
ingly, carelessly tumbled the dishes 
into the washer, and returned to 
his study, brimming over with en- 
thusiasm, real and unfaked, for the 
piay. 

He finished working at 8 : 30. He 
had a fairly good action-chart in 
mind, knew with reasonable ac- 
curacy what sort of stage-rhythms 
he would ask for, where to under- 
score and where to come down 
hard. Directing a play was a subtle 
game with Amory; knowing that 
he alone would appreciate the nu- 
ances he built into each production 
failed to dampen his enthusiasm 
for his work. 

His video set remained dead, 
though, despite the fact that Mist 
of Desire would be reaching the 
public this evening. He had no in- 
terest in seeing a play once he had 
finished with it. It was the original 
creative frenzy that attracted his 

DOWN 



25 




mind, not the final product, which 
more often than not would be hope- 
lessly disappointing. Wednesday 
nights he never tuned in his set; 
ritualistically, he listened to old 
opera tapes instead. 

He chose Wozzeck this evening. 
The work was in German, a lan- 
guage he knew fairly well, and he 
listened, eyes closed, thinking occa- 
sionally of Germany and the other 
now half-forgotten nations on the 
other side of the Atlantic. Curious, 
he thought: for the past generation 
his world had been bounded by 
Canada on the north, the Federated 
Empire of Latin-America on the 
south, and the oceans to east and 
west. Germany was a dream-land 
somewhere in Europe; somewhere 
else in Europe was Rumania, and 
there lived one Filimon Grigorescu, 
like himself an agent of the aliens. 
Amory tried to picture the map of 
Europe, and Rumania in relation 
to Germany, but failed ; even 
though he was old enough to have 
been taught geography once, he had 
forgotten most of what he knew. 

Wozzeck pursued its moody 
course. It ended about the time his 
drama hour went off the air, and 
he cut the sound system and dialed 
the studio. 

This was another tradition. Van 
Graben would be there, of course, 
and Kavanagh — those two seemed 
to live in the Transvideo Tower. 
Amory asked for either of them, and 
got Graben. 

“How’d it look from out there?” 
Graben asked at once. 

“Splendid,” Amory lied. “Re- 
ports come in yet?” 

“There’s just a few. Early re- 

26 



turns, of course, but it looks mag- 
nificent. Product-Intensity’s up four 
point two so far, on early sam- 
plings. Jaberson’s wild with joy.” 

That was the way it went, Amory 
thought. A notch or two up a graph 
and the evening was a success; an 
equal distance down the checked 
paper, and heads rolled in the 
morning. He said, “How about the 
competition?” 

“We haven’t received much from 
Hinkey yet, but the studio did a 
little monitoring on its own and we 
hardly found anyone watching Uni- 
versal from nine to ten. They’re 
probably cutting their throats over 
there. Couldn’t happen to a nicer 
bunch, either.” Graben smiled, 
showing white even teeth too sym- 
metrical to be natural. “Well, I’ve 
got to take off now. They’re yelling 
for me downstairs. Congrats again, 
John. Here’s Kavanagh.” 

The Scripting Committee man 
looked less enthusiastic. His wide, 
pockmarked face had none of Gra- 
ben’s almost hysterical happiness. 
“I think we fouled up, John,” he 
said. 

“What? Graben’s drunk with joy. 
You going to gloom things up, 
Dave?” 

This was traditional too. Kav- 
anagh looked moody and said, 
“Graben’s going to calm down 
when he sees the Mundy-Richard- 
son for tonight. You know that 
scene where the hero storms out of 
the heroine’s place muttering in his 
beard?” 

“Of course I know it. What went 
wrong?” Amory asked. 

“The Mundy-Richardson people 
ran an ideological check on it, and 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 




it turned out that one of fifteen 
people were sure he was heading 
for a bar. A bar , John! What a 
miserable connotation! I don’t 
know how we could have let any- 
thing so ambiguous slip through. 
We may have to fire Nourse for a 
stunt like that.” 

Of course, Amory thought. Don’t 
blame yourselves for the ambiguous 
scene; don’t blame the Scripting 
Committee for fouling up. Blame 
the writer. You hire him just to 
serve as a scapegoat in a pinch like 
this anyway, and you pay him well 
enough. 

“Nourse is a good man,” Amory 
said cautiously. “You better think 
about that a couple of times before 
you do anything serious.” 

“We never do anything without 
thinking, John,” Kavanagh said 
with sudden implied malice. “And 
a low Mundy-Richardson brings 
trouble with the client. We can’t 
have that, John.” 

“Of course not.” 

Kavanagh pleaded an urgent 
post-show conference and hung up. 
Scowling angrily, Amory turned 
away from the phone. Kavanagh 
could find a crisis in anything — 
and tomorrow there would be a 
new party-line for his writers to 
follow. 

The phone rang again. Amory 
shut his eyes, took a deep breath, 
and answered. 

It was Lee Nourse, and he looked 
excited. Before he could say any- 
thing, Amory asked, “Did you see 
the show tonight?” 

Nourse made an impatient face. 
“Of course not. But listen — ” 

“You listen. Something went 



wrong with the Mundy-Richardson 
rating and Kavanagh’s foaming at 
the mouth. Graben doesn’t know 
what happened yet, but you better 
be near your phone when he finds 
out. There’s talk of making you the 
sacrificial scapegoat when it’s time 
for the network to issue its me a cul- 
pas” 

“The hell with that,” Nourse 
snapped. “How can I worry about 
some damned video show when a 
friend is suffering?” 

“Who are you talking about?” 
Amory asked, in sudden alarm. 

“Beckett. Bunch of hoodlums 
broke into his place about half an 
hour ago and just about wrecked 
the works. A bunch called the 
Riverdale Raiders — know them? 
They beat Ted up and turned a 
hose loose inside the apartment. He 
woke up in two feet of water.” 
Amory muttered a short, sharp, 
eloquent curse. “Is anyone with 
him?” 

“Viglan’s on his way over now. 
I’m leaving as soon as I get off the 
phone.” 

“Should I come too?” 

“Not just yet,” Nourse said. “He’s 
in pretty bad shape; we don’t want 
to crowd him. But I just thought 
I’d let you know what happened.” 
“Thanks,” Amory said. 

He stared bleakly at the dead 
screen. Riverdale Raiders, he 
thought, snorting angrily. They 
must have had a fine old time 
with the helpless Beckett. 

He could understand now what 
might persuade people like Nourse, 
sick of the senseless brutality and 
festering hatred that seemed to 
spring wild through humanity, to 

27 



AND THE WALLS CAME TUMBLING DOWN 




hand the planet over to the Magel- 
lanics. Bitterly he realized he might 
almost do the same himself, if he 
cared a little more strongly. River - 
dale Raiders , he thought again, and 
swore. 



F irst rehearsal of Folly 

and Fortune was called for 
eight the following evening. Enter- 
tainment people preferred to work 
after dark ; during the day Manhat- 
tan was clogged with people despite 
the scattering effect achieved by 
abandonment of a rigid 9-to-5 work 
day. By eight p.m. only the last two 
shifts remained on, and then the 
night people emerged to do their 
work. 

Amory worked on the new script 
until almost six; eating then, he 
dressed and left. He had a stop to 
make before arriving at the studio. 

It was nearly seven by the time 
he reached Ted Beckett’s cellar 
apartment in Riverdale. Beckett 
was there, wearing a tattered gray 
dressing-gown, and he was accomp- 
anied by Matt Viglan. 

The place was a wreck. Pools of 
moisture still lay unmopped on the 
floor; the walls had evidently been 
hosed as well, since soggy masses of 
paper indicated where Beckett’s 
Picasso prints had been. A book lay 
floating in a puddle at Amory’s 
feet: The Castle, Amory saw. The 
backbone had been split and pages 
drifted loose in the water. 

“Hello, John,” Beckett said in 
a small tired voice. He wore a tur- 
ban of bandages around his skull; 
his lower lip was swollen, his right 
eye blackened. Amory saw the 

28 



movie screen dangling behind him, 
slashed three times down its full 
length. 

“Why did this happen?” Amory 
asked. 

Beckett shrugged. “It’s been due 
for a long time. The people next 
door used to sit with their ears 
against the walls listening every 
time I had a film showing. They 
must have notified the local vigil- 
ante committee that people were 
thinking in here. And of course they 
couldn’t allow that to go on, so — ” 
Becket shrugged, indicating the de- 
struction. “They came last night. 
Seven or eight of them, in masks. 
They pushed their way past me and 
started dumping the books out of 
the shelves.” Beckett stared brood- 
ingly at the heap of rubble that had 
been his library and added, “I’m 
glad they hit me. I wouldn’t have 
wanted to be conscious while it 
was going on.” 

Amory clenched his fists. “Do the 
police know?” 

“Of course they know,” Viglan 
said. “I called them when I got 
over here. They came, and they 
helped pump the place dry, and 
they left. That’s all.” 

“Won’t there be any investiga- 
tion?” 

“Of this? Don’t be naive, John.” 

Amory glanced sharply at Bec- 
kett. “You knew this was going to 
happen, Ted. You could have 
moved. You could have told us to 
stop coming here. You could have 
asked us to hire protection for you. 
You didn’t. Why?” 

“What was the use?” Beckett 
asked quietly. “Sure, I knew it was 
coming. I didn’t try to fight it. But

I didn’t want to give up ahead of 
time. I wouldn’t let them scare me 
out of what I enjoyed. So in a 
sense I won, even if they ruined 
everything. You see that, John?” 
Amory nodded. “I see.” 

He reached the studio at ten of 
eight. The cast was there already, 
along with Graben and Kavanagh. 
None of the technicians or camera 
men were on hand; those would 
come later in the week, after Amory 
had worked out the rough plan of 
his staging and imparted it to the 
cast. Tonight would simply be a 
runthrough, as Amory surveyed the 
coarse material and set about sha- 
ping it into the polished production 
that would be shown the following 
Wednesday. 

Kavanagh glanced up at him as 
he entered. “Evening, John.” 
“Hello, Dave. Van. We recover 
from last night’s catastrophe yet? 
Or are the returns still coming in?” 
Both Graben and Kavanagh 
looked blank. Graben said, “What 
the devil you mean, John? We 
picked up an even five on P-I, and 
the Hinkey was a smash. Universal’s 
moaning. You joking or some- 
thing?” 

“I’m talking about the Mundy- 
Richardson,” Amory said. 

“That was fine too,” said Graben, 
frowning. The network executive’s 
artificial smile clicked off for an 
instant to show displeasure, then 
clicked back, steely as ever. “What’s 
eating you, Amory?” 

“Last night,” Amory said pa- 
tiently, “I called you. Dave told 
me we took a beating on the 
Mundy-Richardson and that heads 



would roll. Didn’t he tell you?” 
Graben swivelled his head toward 
Kavanagh. “Huh?” 

Kavanagh shrugged vaguely. “I 
hardly remember now. Those must 
have been early returns, or some- 
thing. The graph levelled off beau- 
tifully toward midnight when the 
Coast poop came in. Splendid job 
last night, John; splendid.” 

Amory felt sick. These network 
men were slick and empty, living 
only in the current minute. Kav- 
anagh had already managed to for- 
get the short-lived crisis of the 
night before. 

“You hear what happened to 
Ted Beckett?” Amory asked. 

Graben nodded. “Viglan called 
in with the story. Matt won’t be 
here tonight, by the way — he’s 
tending a sick aunt. But we all 
heard.” 

“I knew Beckett was wrong from 
the start,” Kavanagh said. “I al- 
ways know in a case like that. I 
fired him because he was a devia- 
tionist, you know.” 

“Yes. I remember,” Amory said 
stiffly. 

“Well, now the court of public 
opinion has confirmed it. Whatever 
he got was better than he deserved. 
And I tell you, that Lee Nourse is 
going to go the same way one of 
these months. One more ideologi- 
cally uncertain script and — ” 
Amory coughed suddenly. “Time 
to get the rehearsal under way, I 
guess.” He walked away, leaving 
Kavanagh with mouth gaping open 
fishwise, wanting to get away from 
those two before some of their in- 
ner corruption slopped out and 
poisoned him. 



AND THE WALLS CAME TUMBLING DOWN 



29 




“Places, everyone !” he snapped. 
“First run-through of Folly and 
Fortune!” 

Like every other first run- 
through, it was abominable. Amory 
held himself in check through the 
entire first act, delivering himself of 
a blistering fifteen-minute speech 
when the curtain-line had been 
spoken. To his relief, the second 
act picked up slightly. He thought 
about Matt Viglan’s “sick aunt,” 
and wondered what Graben and 
Kavanagh would say if they learned 
that the author of tonight’s stellar 
script had lied to them, and was 
actually at this very moment in the 
presence of Theodore Beckett, sub- 
versive and arch-deviationist. And 
that the man directing tonight’s 
stellar script had just left Beckett’s 
place himself. 

Heads would certainly roll, to use 
Kavanagh’s own beloved phrase. 

He remembered another phrase, 
from a calm memorandum: . 
necessary for Galactic peace to 
cleanse Earth of its population . 

“Exit left, Ray,” the part of his 
mind watching the stage said. 
“Peg’s going to be coming on right, 
so you can’t go out the same door. 
See? ” 

Cleanse Earth ? Well , why not? 
Why struggle to save Earth from 
the Magellanics, why fight to pre- 
serve Graben and Kavanagh and 
Real People and their Real Prob- 
lems in the World of Today, and 
the seven or eight Riverdale Raiders 
who had smashed Ted Beckett’s 
apartment? 

Shaking his head, he forced him- 
self to devote all his attention to 

30 



the stage. With a conscious effort he 
drove the upwelling pessimism into 
a deep recess of his mind, and 
turned his mind to other problems. 

Folly and Fortune ground on to 
its soggy finale; Amory broke in 
constantly to snap his whip. At 
eleven-fifteen he was at last satis- 
fied, and dismissed the cast. “Be 
here at eight sharp tomorrow,” he 
ordered. “And if you don’t know 
your lines letter-clean, don’t bother 
showing up.” 

He turned away from his po- 
dium. Only half-listening, he took 
in Graben’s comments on the script, 
heard Kavanagh praise the fine 
work his Committee had done in 
preparing it from Viglan’s error- 
riddled original, and excused him- 
self. 

The moment of defeat had 
passed. Perhaps Aristotle’s ancient 
precept still held: the play, feeble 
as it was, had somehow purged him 
of pity and fear. He had his answer 
to the dark question of half an hour 
earlier. 

Perhaps mankind should be 
cleansed from the face of the 
Earth. But, he thought, it should be 
man himself who does the cleans- 
ing, not cold-eyed beings from the 
stars. 

He kept his appointment with 
Gargh. Precisely at one-twenty the 
following afternoon he arrived out- 
side the mirror-bright sphincter- 
door which read CARGH & CO., 
BY APPOINTMENT ONLY. 

Well, he had an appointment. 
Tentatively he touched the surface 
of the sphincter. A voice from a 
concealed speaker said, “Just one 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 





moment, Mr. Amory.” 

The sphincter opened. 

Amory followed the corridor as 
far as the inner sphincter, which 
was already open. Cargh met him 
there and led him down the hall to 
the room where he had awakened 
on Wednesday. The place was 
strangely silent. 

“Aren’t there any others 
around?” Amory asked. “I mean, 
you’re not the only one of your kind 
on Earth, are you?” 

“Of course not. There are others. 
There are others here in Manhat- 
tan, and there are some in Europe 
as well. We’re aware that there’s 

AND THE WALLS CAME TUMBLING 



little communication between con- 
tinents on this planet, and we’re 
hopeful of making our survey as 
complete as possible.” 

Of course , Amory thought. He 
noticed that the desk was clear of 
papers this time, and that the docu- 
ment he had slid under the leg had 
been removed. 

Cargh gestured to a foamy tur- 
quoise recliner that faced the desk, 
and indicated that Amory should 
lie down in it. He did so, wondering 
idly whether this was the prelude 
to an invasion or an analysis. Cargh 
looked sleek and calm, his dark blue 
face picking up highlights from the 

DOWN 



31 



hard clear glow-lights embedded in 
the ceiling. He seemed in no hurry 
to begin the interview. 

At length he seated himself be- 
hind the desk, drew a tablet and 
stylus from somewhere, and said, 
“You’re an expert on the drama, 
Mr. Amory. Right?” 

“I like to think so,” Amory said, 
half sardonically and half in hu- 
mility. 

“We’ve collected a good-size li- 
brary of plays already,” Cargh said. 
“I’ll read you the titles. On this first 
reading, I want you to rate the 
plays on an absolute scale of value, 
the most enduring being rated One y 
the almost-great Two , and so on 
down to Ten. Can you do that?” 
“I suppose so,” Amory said. Ab- 
solute scale of values , he thought. 
As if such a thing could exist in 
literature. But that’s the way a race 
that goes around cleansing other 
planets might think. 

He did his best. Cargh smiled 
blankly at him and spouted a title: 
“Hedda Gabler . Ibsen.” 

“Three,” Amory said without 
thinking. “No — four.” 

“Revenger’s Tragedy. Tourneur.” 
“Two.” 

“Coriolanus. Shakespeare.” 

“Take all of Shakespeare, I’d 
say.” 

“We asked for individual ra- 
tings,” Cargh said coldly. 

“Two, then.” 

“Bussy D’ambois. Chapman.” 
“Five.” 

It went on for more than an 
hour ; Amory yielded up snap 
judgements with vigor and glee, 
barking them back as fast as the 
alien could read the play-titles to 

32 



him. The fact that he had some- 
how rated Doctor Faustus above All 
for Love but below Aurung-Zebe 
meant little to him; it was impos- 
sible to keep half a thousand rela- 
tive gradings in mind, and the ab- 
solute scale Cargh had asked for 
simply did not exist. 

At length Cargh said, “Thank 
you very much. You’ve been ex- 
tremely helpful. Now, as to music 

»5 

Another weary hour went by as 
Amory classified composers by 
ranks. Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, 
Bartok, Monteverdi rated the first 
rank; he placed Wagner too low, 
Corelli too high, but did not bother 
to correct his ratings when he 
thought back over them. The situa- 
tion was roughly analogous to the 
one he faced in directing video 
plays: the people benefiting from 
his talents simply did not know the 
difference between good and bad, 
and so whatever he said was right. 

“There’ll be difficulties in lo- 
cating all these works, I imagine,” 
Cargh said, staring down at his list. 
“We only have collected a few re- 
cordings so far. I suppose you’ll be 
able to help us in that.” 

“I suppose so,” Amory agreed. 
He coughed and said, “All this 
talking is making me thirsty. Do you 
think you could — ” 

“Of course.” Cargh nudged the 
stud at the side of the desk, and 
almost immediately afterward an- 
other alien entered carrying a tray. 
To Amory’s astonishment he saw 
the newcomer was identical in every 
respect to Cargh. 

He took the drink — a wine, mild- 
ly acrid, light green-yellow in color. 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 




He sipped slowly, knowing this 
would be his only moment of rest 
until the interrogation was over. It 
was only when he finished and re- 
placed the glass on the gleaming 
tray that he remembered his trou- 
bles had begun with a glass of very 
similar wine. 

“What is this stuff?” he asked. 

Gargh smiled blandly. “It’s a 
German wine. Our European 
agents sent it to us. Do you like it?” 

“Very much.” 

“We’ll have a case of it sent to 
your home at once. Consider it part 
payment from us. Now, in the field 
of art, would you say — ” 

He called a halt to the proceed- 
ings at 4:30, claiming truthfully 
that he had to ready himself for 
the evening’s rehearsal. He felt 
physically drained, both from the 
mental effort of marshalling critical 
data and forming rapid-fire opin- 
ions and from the deeper strain of 
masking his true feelings from the 
alien. 

“Must you go so soon?” Cargh 
asked. 

“I’m afraid so.” 

He clambered up from the re- 
cliner and the alien guided him 
through the winding corridors 
again, out to the dropshaft, and 
with murmured expressions of grati- 
tude saw him off. Amory found 
himself below in the street almost 
uncomfortably soon afterward. 

It was approaching five; the 
standard-shift people were flooding 
from the office buildings, ready to 
streak homeward. A beggar ad- 
vanced down the broad avenue to- 
ward Amory, limping along on a 



bright chrome crutch; his left leg 
ended neatly at the knee. 

“Got some money for a needy 
man, doctor?” 

The beggar stared him squarely 
in the eyes, facing him from the up- 
town side of the street. Overhead 
the commuters whizzed by. The 
beggar’s voice was deep and reso- 
nant; Amory liked the timbre. “I 
used to be an actor,” the man said. 
“I did plays. I lost my leg serving a 
term in prison for security devia- 
tion. Couple of my cellmates played 
a prank that worked out better 
than they thought. Can you spare 
a dollar, doctor?” 

“You’re not going to get very 
far advertising that you’re a devia- 
tionist,” Amory said. “You’re likely 
to lose that other leg instead.” 

“I don’t tell everyone that. But 
you look different. I can tell by the 
eyes. Can I have a dollar?” 

Amory smiled slowly, drew out 
his billfold, and peeled off five crisp 
little plastic-impregnated bills. 
“Here,” he said. “Courtesy of 
Transcontinental Televideo.” 

“But these are twenties , mister! 
Twenties !” 

“I know,” Amory said, and 
stalked away, down the busy hum- 
ming street, looking for a place to 
eat and pass three hours until the 
rehearsal. Once he looked back 
and saw the beggar smiling after 
him, clutching Amory’s guilt-offer- 
ing in his hand. 

You can buy a man’s soul, Amory 
thought, with a fistful of twenties. 
Tired, dispirited, he found a corner 
autovend, cashed a bill in for 
tokens, and dined miserably on 
algae pancakes that were stale and 

33 



AND THE WALLS CAME TUMBLING DOWN 




undercooked, washing them down 
with lukewarm caffeine-drink in a 
greasy cup. When he dumped the 
dishes into the conveyer, he caught 
a glimpse of his face reflected in 
a metal pillar, and saw that it was 
pale and shiny with sweat. 

HE NEXT DAY was Satur- 
day; Amory, sharp in his re- 
solve, called Nourse about noon. 
The writer was at home. He looked 
across the screen at Amory with a 
faint smile curling his lips, as if he 
were smug and complacent about 
something Amory was not to know. 

Amory said, “You know why I’m 
calling, don’t you?” 

“You want to see that esper. 
Okay, John — I set up the appoint- 
ment for you for tomorrow at three- 
thirty. Hadafield will see you at 
home.” 

“Where’s that?” 

“Out on the Island,” Nourse said. 
“Better carry a gun. I’ll meet you 
at the Island Thruway Depot at 
two-thirty sharp.” 

Nourse, as always, met his own 
deadline. Amory arrived at the 
arching glassite bubble that was 
the Thruway Depot at two-twenty- 
nine, according to the glowing 
radioclock atop the main tower, 
and Nourse was already there, his 
lean face nervously anticipatory, 
slouching against a seat in the wait- 
ing-room with one foot drawn up 
beneath his body. 

“There’s a cab waiting for us 
on Level Four,” Nourse said. “He’ll 
take us as far as Levittown. Hada- 
field lives a little further up, but 
it’s off the Thruway and no driver 

34 



will go there. Armed?” 

Amory nodded, indicating a 
bulge under one arm. “I’ve had this 
thing for years without needing to 
use it. I hope today’s not the day.” 
“You never can tell,” Nourse 
said. 

Their cab was waiting on Level 
Four as Nourse had said, its tur- 
boelectric motor throbbing impa- 
tiently. The cab, of course, was 
driverless ; the driver sat com- 
fortably in an air-conditioned booth 
beneath the Hudson River, ready 
to guide them by remote control. 
Human-driven vehicles had been 
outlawed thirty years before, as 
dangerously unsafe. 

Nourse got in first, Amory after 
him, and they strapped their safety- 
belts down securely. The door 
clicked shut; it would not open 
again until the fare had been paid 
in full. 

“Okay, driver,” Nourse said to 
the speaker-receiver grid above his 
head. “Let’s go.” 

The car silently swung down the 
winding rampway that led from the 
depot garage to the main road; the 
engines picked up power as they 
moved on, and by the time the car 
popped out onto the roadway they 
were travelling at seventy miles an 
hour. The cab settled easily into 
the traffic-pattern, controls locked 
down at a smooth hundred thirty- 
five m.p.h., and glided along the 
shining roadway that led to the dis- 
mal slums of Long Island. 

Amory said nothing. He watched 
the whizzing scenery, the barely- 
glimpsed heaps of rotting old 
houses, here and there the bright 
towers of a reclamation project 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 





newly erected. Town after town 
flew past, with hardly an acre of 
green undeveloped land to be seen 
anywhere. It began to seem as if 
three-quarters of New York City’s 
nineteen million inhabitants lived 
out here on the Island, though 
Amory knew that was untrue. 

“Levittown,” the driver said 
finally. 

The meter read $3.26. Amory 
took out a five, slid it into the wait- 
ing orifice, and waited a moment 
for the bill to be scanned. The cab 
slowed to a halt just beyond the 
Thruway turnoff ; a dollar bill 
clicked back out of the slot, fol- 
lowed by seventy-four cents in 
change. The cab doors opened of 
their own accord. 

Amory and Nourse rode the es- 
calator down to ground level — this 
part of the Thruway was too old to 
be equipped with dropshafts — and 
paused a moment on the edge of 
the crumbling, criss-crossed pedes- 
trian walkway, getting their bear- 
ings. 

The houses had evidently been 
identical at one time, row on row 
on row of them extending back 
from the roadway for miles. But the 
passage of years had worked a 
strange metamorphosis : each home- 
owner or home-renter, anxious to 
differentiate his own place in some 
way, had altered it. Now the fore- 
most row presented a garish ap- 
pearance. The squat little old build- 
ings were painted red and green 
and blue, no two the same color, 
and here or there a striated web- 
work of yellow caught the eye. Most 
of them were losing their paint, 
too, which augmented the general 



piebald appearance. Curious ornate 
balconies and chimneys and other 
such excrescences had been added 
to a few homes in a further at- 
tempt to distinguish them from 
their neighbors. 

And the filth. Amory stood ankle- 
deep in uncollected garbage that 
had been strewn near the pedes- 
trian walkway; out here none of the 
houses had thermal disposalls, and 
the garbage collection was uncer- 
tain and irregular. Amory had 
thought Riverdale was filthy — but 
Beckett’s area had looked virtually 
antiseptic compared with what met 
his eye now. 

“It’s up that hill, past Red Maple 
Drive and then right. Keep your 
eyes open,” Nourse advised. 

Amory nodded, unsmilingly. 
They started to walk. 

They found the body on the cor- 
ner of Red Maple, near their turn- 
off. Amory found it first, nearly 
stumbling over it (he had been 
looking to all sides, but not down) 
and emitting a little gasp of shock 
when he saw it. 

It was the corpse of a man in his 
twenties — dead at least three days, 
perhaps more. His throat had been 
very meticulously sliced from a 
point beginning just under the left 
ear to the tip of the right jawbone, 
and just as meticulously his trouser- 
pockets had been slashed open and 
their contents extracted. The dirt- 
smeared face looked curiously un- 
troubled. 

“Come on,” Nourse grunted. 
“You looking for trouble? We 
haven’t had any yet; don’t ask for 
it.” 



AND THE WALLS CAME TUMBLING DOWN 



35 




“We just walk by and leave this 
man here?” 

Nourse shrugged. “He’s dead, 
isn’t he? You can’t do him any good 
now. And maybe the fellow who 
killed him is lurking back of that 
trash barrel. You keep staring at 
that corpse, the locals’ll think you’re 
a relative come round to start a 
vendetta. Better keep moving, 
John.” 

“But—” 

Amory saw there was no use 
protesting. He forced back a little 
shiver of disgust and they turned 
down Red Maple. A small, very 
dirty boy of about three, naked, 
lean, came out to stare at them as 
they went past. A woman of twenty 
— his mother, probably — snatched 
him back inside the house with a 
quick clawlike hand. 

“They keep off the streets out 
here, don’t they?” 

“As a rule. You live longer that 
way.” Nourse smiled moodily and 
added, “If anyone would buy it I’d 
write a novel about this place. It’s 
the nearest thing to hell this side 
of the Mississippi, and right up 
there’s the shiny Thruway like a 
symbol of all man’s wonderful prog- 
ress. And forty minutes away is 
Manhattan. Here we are,” he said 
quietly, almost as an afterthought, 
and they turned up the walk to- 
ward a small shabby house whose 
unpainted exterior made it almost 
flamboyantly conspicuous amid the 
riot of color all around it. 

The name on the mailbox was 
Crisley. Below it, in smaller letters, 
came the names Bryan , Vuorjek, 
Levin , Hadafield. “Espers tend to 
cluster together,” Nourse explained 

36 



as he rang the bell. The door 
opened almost immediately, with- 
out the usual interval for scanning 
the visitors. Of course, Amory 
thought; espers wouldn’t need to 
maintain a conventional scanning 
system. 

He found himself looking up into 
gentle green eyes, set in a non- 
descript round-featured face. 

“Hello, Mr. Amory,” Gill Hada- 
field said. 

Psionic contact was a new field 
of experience for Amory. He lay 
quietly on the ragged couch in 
Hadafield’ s one bare room, watch- 
ing the inert figure of the esper on 
the floor, glancing occasionally at 
Nourse, who sat tense-faced in the 
darkest comer of the room. 

Hadafield writhed as if in anguish 
a moment ; curiously tranquil smiles 
flickered rapidly over his face, al- 
ternating with grimaces of real 
pain. Amory waited. 

Filimon Grigorescu, he thought. 
Just a name on a memorandum 
from one Kress to one Cargh, con- 
cerning the forthcoming cleansing 
of life from Earth of the Sol system. 
And what a strange thing I have 
in common with Filimon Grigores- 
cu of Rumania. Amory thought, 
watching Hadafield quiver in the 
effort to make contact. 

It was curious how the total 
breakdown of intercontinental com- 
munication had coincided with a 
sudden upwelling of psi powers 
among humanity — as if the block- 
ade of Europe and the confiscation 
of amateur radio equipment had 
somehow made it necessary for na- 
ture to provide some new means of 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 




communication. There were not 
many admitted espers, and an un- 
happy number of those had the 
power only in a vague and indeter- 
minate fashion, or else were sheer 
frauds seeking notoriety and per- 
haps martyrdom. Hadafield was the 
genuine article, though. He seemed 
to be in torment on the floor, but 
it was the ecstatic torment of the 
genuine mystic, the passionate pain 
of deep-level communication. 

He sat up suddenly. His face was 
drained of blood ; only his eyes 
showed no sign of strain. “Con- 
tact is achieved,” he whispered. 
“There’ll be a lag of a minute or 
two. Give me your hand, Amory.” 

“You sure this is going to be com- 
pletely confidential, now,” Amory 
asked uneasily. 

Hadafield shrugged and said, “I 
tell you I’m simply acting as a 
short-wave radio for you. None of 
your message will stay in my mind ; 
it’ll all filter through me, through 
the link in Rumania, into your 
Grigorescu. But even if I could tune 
in on your message myself, which I 
.can’t, I assure you I’d keep it con- 
fidential.” He groaned suddenly. 
“Grigorescu has been found. Hold 
on tight, now; when you let go of 
me, I’ll have to break contact.” 

Hadafield’s hand was cold and 
soft. Amory gripped it tightly, think- 
ing, Filimon Grigorescu , I want 
to talk with you. Filimon Grigor- 
escu — 

A weird mental image formed in 
his mind: a dark violet-hued cor- 
ridor, then a network of interlock- 
ing corridors, swirling and tangling 
and untangling again, stretching 
out over half the world, tightening, 



thickening — 

Light appeared beyond the dark- 
ness. A bright hard spot of yellow 
that rushed forward like a flaming 
star, blazed fitfully, cooled — 

I am Filimon Grigorescue, a si- 
lent voice said. 

Grigorescu was communicated 
entire ; a short stocky man, evidently 
of great physical strength, with deep 
searching eyes and a heavy outjut- 
ting nose whose fleshy tip reached 
almost to the firm upper lip. Amory 
saw him as clearly as if he stood 
in the darkened room. He was look- 
ing patiently at Amory, wondering 
apparently why he had been called ; 
Amory knew suddenly that this was 
a man of integrity and faith. 

Who are you? 

“My name is John Amory. I’m 
an American. Do you know where 
and what America is?” 

Of course. What do you want 
with me? 

Instead of answering, Amory 
transmitted a sharp mental image 
of Cargh. It achieved its effect; 
Grigorescu seemed to recoil in 
quick astonishment. 

“Do you know who that is?” 

That is Cargh. How do you know 
him? 

Grigorescu’s alien contact, then, 
had given the same name, or else 
perhaps was the same one whom 
Amory knew. Back from the Ru- 
manian came an equally vivid 
image of the alien. 

“I . help Cargh here in Amer- 
ica,” Amory said. “Selecting works 
of art for him to take back to his 
own world.” 

And I too. I was bewildered when 
they first came to me, but 1 am 

37 



AND THE WALLS CAME TUMBLING DOWN 




over my fear of them now and have 
been of great help to them. 

Amory took a deep breath. His 
metallic mesh blouse was pasted 
stickily to his back. “Do you know 
why Cargh and his friends are on 
Earth?” 

To study. To learn to know us. 

“No,” Amory said sharply. 

“No?” 

“Listen to me,” Amory said. He 
transmitted a visual representation 
of the document he had seen four 
days before, at his first meeting with 
Cargh. The image was clear and 
sharp, well focussed. 

For a long moment there was 
complete silence at the other end, 
and Amory wondered if the contact 
had been broken or not. Just as he 
had decided Grigorescu had broken 
off, the backwash of indignation 
and anger hit him, and he wavered 
under the force of it. 

It is impossible to lie in this sort 
of contact , is it not? Grigorescu 
asked. What you have shown me 
actually exists. 

“Yes,” Amory said. 

Then 1 have been deceived and 
we are all betrayed. 1 am a Judas , 
then, a Quisling, a traitor — 

“You knew nothing. It wasn’t 
your fault.” 

What should we do now? 

Hadafield stirred; Amory knew 
the remaining time was short. 
“Don’t do anything. Continue to 
work with the aliens, and whatever 
happens don’t let them find out we 
know their real motives. I’ll be in 
touch with you again; in the mean- 
time, just keep on as before. I’m 
developing a plan against them.” 

A solid wave of gratitude came 

38 



flowing from the Rumanian. Hada- 
field stirred again. Then the image 
of Grigorescu wavered, blurred an 
instant, and shattered like a punc- 
tured bubble. 

The shock of bursting back into 
reality stunned Amory an instant. 
He realized he had been gripping 
Hadafield’s hand with terrible in- 
tensity, and he released it, seeing 
the marks of his fingers in the 
esper’s pale flesh. 

He sat up and looked around. 
Hadafield lay slumped as if in 
sleep; Nourse leaned back casually 
with legs crossed. 

“Is it all over?” Nourse asked. 

“Yes,” Amory said, surprised to 
find that his voice was but a hoarse 
whisper. “I made contact. Couldn’t 
you tell?” 

“The two of you were in a trance 
the whole time. I couldn’t hear 
anything.” Nourse bent and gently 
lifted Hadafield. The esper’s per- 
spiration-flooded face was still 
knotted in concentration; slowly, 
he opened his eyes. “Was the con- 
tact satisfactory?” he asked. 

“Very much so,” Amory said. “I 
feel I owe you something. Is there 
any fee — ” 

“No,” Hadafield said quickly. 
“We never take money.” 

“All right then,” said Amory. 
“Tell me: do you remember any- 
thing at all of what was said?” 

Hadafield shook his head. “No. 
Not a thing.” 

Amory smiled grimly. “I guess 
you mean it. If you’d been listen- 
ing, you — well, skip it. Lee, let’s go 
home; I’m exhausted.” 

Hadafield accompanied them to 
the door; Amory caught one last 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 




glimpse of the esper’s fleshless big- 
nosed face staring curiously at him, 
and then the door closed. They 
made their way back to the Thru- 
way escalator in silence, and with- 
out incident. 



S ITTING OPPOSITE Nourse, 
staring up at the oriental screens 
on his study walls, Amory said, 
“How would you react if I told you 
the world was in terrible danger?” 
Nourse smiled slowly and humor- 
lessly. “I don’t know. Is it?” 

“You know more than you claim 
to,” Amory responded. “But we’ll 
let that drop for now. Suppose I 
told you that the future of human- 
ity depends on reestablishment of 
contact between the nations of the 
world, and breakdown of this stasis 
of communication that’s been in 
effect for the last thirty years? Sup- 
pose I say that unless we unite 
against a common enemy we’re 
finished?” 

- Nourse sipped his drink reflec- 
tively; his eyelid was twitching, tell- 
ing the watching Amory that a 
hidden chord had been struck. 
“There’s been enmity between the 
hemispheres for almost a century,” 
Nourse said in a quiet voice. “It 
never came to actual war, not a 
shooting-type war. But it turned 
into a propaganda war. And now 
America and Russia and Latin 
America and Asia each has its 
own little protective bubble, and if 
it weren’t for the espers there’d be 
no communication with them at 
all. A couple of generations and no 
one in America will remember that 
there ever were any other countries. 



And then some 25th Century lad 
will do a Columbus-in-reverse and 
discover Europe, and — ” 

“There won’t be any 25th Cen- 
tury,” Amory said. “Not unless 
those barriers come down within a 
year from now. Earth stands to be 
conquered.” 

“By whom?” 

Amory rolled his eyes toward the 
ceiling and said, “You don’t have 
to believe this. But there are extra- 
terrestrial beings already on Earth, 
getting ready for the invasion.” 

The silence that followed seemed 
to last forever. Nourse was perfectly 
immobile, staring at Amory as if 
he were staring through him. At 
length he said, “You’ve been watch- 
ing Mark Belford’s kiddie-horror 
hour again, John. Or maybe you’ve 
been directing it.” 

“I said you didn’t have to believe 
it. I hardly believe it myself. But 
take it as a hypothetical case, then: 
given alien invaders, how do you 
proceed to save Earth?” 

Nourse’s eyelid twitched convul- 
sively. “You can’t come right out 
and tell everyone about the aliens, 
of course. No one would believe 
you.” 

“If I produced an alien?” 

“That would be your final job. 
First it’s necessary to reestablish 
contact between the nations. Once 
that’s done, drag out your alien and 
show them the common threat.” 
Nourse shook his head bitterly. “It’s 
no simple job to reestablish contact, 
though. Three generations of Amer- 
icans have been taught to hate 
Europe as a plague-spot. The young 
people hardly even know it’s there. 
Thanks to our blessed mass media, 



AND THE WALLS CAME TUMBLING DOWN 



39 




a perfect propaganda job has been 
done.” 

“Propaganda works both ways,” 
Amory said. “And the video audi- 
ence is a captive one. There must 
be fifty million compulsive tele- 
viewers in this country who’d soon- 
er cut off a hand than turn the set 
off in the evening.” 

“What are you getting at?” 

“Suppose — just for the sake of 
discussion — that a few people set 
about altering the national view- 
point, shifting it away from isola- 
tionism. A reference here, a news 
item there ... it could be done, 
couldn’t it?” 

“How? I can put any damn thing 
I want into a script, but Dave 
Kavanagh’s going to take it out 
again anyway, so why bother? 
Video’s too thoroughly censored.” 

“Kavanagh has no control over 
the actual production. We get a few 
actors to restore your original lines 
the night of the performance — 
make them subtle, of course — and 
reinforce our holdings with printed 
handbills.” Amory clasped his 
hands a moment and added, “We 
could get the newscasters to help 
out. And a few of the folksy guitar- 
men could slip a couple of ref- 
erences in. We carry this on for 
nearly a year, slowly building up in 
the public mind the concept that 
there are other countries in the 
world, that they’re not our enemies, 
that we can live peacefully with 
them. Then — we pool our cash, buy 
90 minutes of video time, and put 
on a spectacular fact-show that 
clinches the case. No one can censor 
it before hand, since we’ll be the 
sponsors!” 

40 



“They can cut it off the air,” 
Nourse pointed out. 

“Certainly they can. But that’ll 
simply arouse the public more 
strongly. We bait our hook in the 
first part of the show; if they cut 
us off, the audience is going to want 
to know why. It won’t be easy, but 
I think we could manage to swing 
it. And then finally we get the bar- 
rier legislation repealed and — ” 
“You talk as if this can be done 
in a single year,” Nourse said. “It 
can’t. Five years, ten maybe, but 
not one year. It takes time to put 
a world back together.” 

Amory stood up. “We only have 
a year, Lee. I wasn’t fooling about 
those aliens. They’re here, and 
they’re ready to wipe us all out.” 
“John—” 

“Okay,” snapped Amory. “Don’t 
believe me. Let’s just take this on 
as an intellectual game: can we, 
being influential executives of 
America’s greatest mass medium, 
so manipulate the public conscious- 
ness in a way that will bring about 
the rebirth of internationalism? Call 
it a project. Set a year’s deadline 
for it.” 

“It’s subversive. It’s deviational.” 
“Of course it is. Will you help?” 
Nourse smiled warmly. “Sure I 
will,” he said. “Aliens or no aliens.” 

The next few days were busy 
ones for Amory. He put in his 
nightly stint on Folly and Fortune , 
which underwent a midweek 
change of title to Flesh and Folly . 
The word came from Dave Kavan- 
agh, who explained that money- 
referents were henceforth to be 
dropped from drama-program titles, 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 




as a general rule. It seemed the 
Mundy-Richardson connotation re- 
searchers had come up with the fact 
that many viewers subconsciously 
resented such referents, and tended 
to objectify their resentment by 
staying away from the client’s prod- 
uct. 

A close observer might have no- 
ticed that Amory was not devoting 
his full intensity of attention to the 
rechristened play, but there were 
no close observers. Amory saw to it 
that the job he was turning out was 
mechanically competent, at least, 
but he made no extra effort to in- 
spire his cast. He needed his ener- 
gies elsewhere. 

For three hours each day he met 
with Cargh, and he and the alien 
progressed rapidly on their tour of 
Terran art and culture. Chiefly 
Amor/s work was one of list-mak- 
ing: he prepared lengthy catalogues 
of the world’s finest paintings, and 
Cargh assured him that matter- 
duplications would be made of these 
paintings almost immediately. How 
the aliens planned to gain access to 
the works, Amory did not know and 
only half-cared; perhaps they had 
a worldwide network of human 
collaborators ready to visit museums 
for them. 

He left these meetings with Cargh 
drained of vigor, white-faced, ex- 
hausted. The endless list-making 
tired him, as did the effort of keep- 
ing his false face up at all times. 
Cargh seemed to have no difficulty 
along those lines ; never once did he 
say or imply that his presence on 
Earth was for any other than benign 
purposes. Amory wondered occa- 
sionally whether that memorandum 



had been an hallucination — but he 
knew his mind was too clear and 
sharp, his memory of that sheet of 
paper too vivid, for it to be any less 
real than Cargh himself. 

Amory formed the habit of going 
to a Relaxomat after leaving the 
alien. His nerves needed easing, and 
generally he had several hours to 
spend before reporting to the studio. 
Besides, the Relaxomat gave him an 
automatic entry into the everyday 
world, the world of that common 
mass audience with which he had 
so little in common and whose mind 
he was hoping to reach and mani- 
pulate. 

Rehearsal was called for 8; he 
left Cargh at 5. The Relaxomat 
was a bright cave in the sublevel of 
the nearby transport depot, and 
Amory entered. 

They knew him by sight, but not 
by name. The white-smocked atten- 
dants nodded politely at him. He 
rented a locker, stripped, and 
ducked through the low door into 
the relaxing chamber. He found an 
unoccupied relaxor and climbed in. 

The warm nutrient mixture 
welled up around him as he 
slumped down into it, his body find- 
ing the textured rubber cushion at 
the bottom of the vat. He leaned 
back, letting the stress drain from 
his muscles, keeping only his head 
above the surface of the nutrient. A 
warm lethargy stole over him; he 
felt protected, secure, free from 
strain. 

The relaxor was vaguely womb- 
like in shape. It was no coincidence 
of design. 

After the first few moments of 
relaxation he forced himself up out 

41 



AND THE WALLS CAME TUMBLING DOWN 




of the mindless content that en- 
wrapped him. He opened his eyes 
and glanced around. 

Bright glareless overhead lights 
illuminated the vitrin tiles. He saw 
four balding heads projecting from 
four relaxor vats, men with eyes 
closed, mouth upcurving in the 
inane smile of utter tranquility. But 
on the other side of him men were 
exercizing. He listened to their con- 
versation eagerly. 

“You watch Furley’s show last 
night, Jack?” 

“Never miss it. Wife swears by 
it. Don’t know what we’d do with- 
out Furley on Monday nights.” 
“That man has sense. When he 
says something it’s true. Comes from 
the heart, y’know?” 

“Isn’t it the truth? I believe in 
that man, Fred.” 

Amory smiled to himself and shut 
his eyes once again, slipping back 
into the bath. Furley. He had met 
the man once. One of these home- 
spun philosophers so popular on 
video. Amory made a note to see 
him, as soon as possible. 

Not now, though. Not for a 
while. First, relax. Slide back into 
the warm beckoning trough of life, 
return, relax, sleep. Warm. Com- 
forting. You can stop thinking here ; 
you don’t have to think at all. 

You can almost forget that a 
shadow hangs over the world, and 
that all responsibility devolves on 
you. Shuck off responsibility here. 
Relax . relax . 

Relax until there’s nothing left 
of you but the cold hard core of 
fear and tension in your middle, 
Amory thought suddenly. A core 
that no gentle lapping bath can 



wash away. You can forget only 
so much — but not the inner stab 
of fear. 

He climbed out of the bath. Al- 
most instantly an attendant glided 
toward him. 

“Rubdown, sir? Exercise? Mech- 
anostim?” 

Amory shook his head impa- 
tiently. “Not today, Joe. Some other 
time.” It was a great temptation, 
but he fought it off. There was work 
to do. 

Hal Furley was a rawboned, 
rangy man well over six feet tall, 
wearing a loose gabardine shirt, 
bright green whipcord trousers, and 
an informal duroplast neckerchief 
twisted in an intricate knot. He 
seemed to radiate good nature, vir- 
tue, strength and charm; the open 
readiness of his smile indicated sin- 
cerity and warmth. It was hardly 
surprising that his monologues, de- 
livered in traditional homespun 
style, would be so fantastically pop- 
ular with the American people. He 
seemed to sum up all the subli- 
minal connotations that the label 
“American” brought to mind. 

Including one that the American 
people failed to see in him, but 
which Amory, being a considerably 
more perceptive judge of character 
than the average televiewer, spotted 
instantly. Something — a glint in 
Furley’s eyes, a way he had of care- 
fully rippling his jaw muscles before 
each supposedly unstudied smile — 
spoke of shrewdness and ambition 
carried almost to the point of greed. 

He said, “You could get me a 
part in your show, Mr. Amory? A 
starring role?” 



42 



ROBERT SILVERBERG 




His voice was deep and soft, with 
the flat twang of New England 
speech and the slow drawl of the 
South and the clear-cut Midwestern 
inflection all simultaneously em- 
bodied in it. They were in his office 
in the Transvideo Tower, a luxur- 
iously furnished place that seemed 
oddly in contrast with the simple 
virtues Furley publicly espoused. 

Amory nodded slowly. “It would- 
n’t be hard. The casting chief takes 
his orders directly from me. So do 
most of the writers. We could build 
a play around you — or, rather, a 
homespun-type character of the 
sort you embody. It wouldn’t be 
you, of course — you’d simply be 
playing a Hal Furley named Joe 
So-and-So in a video drama.” 
Furley moistened his lips in a 
clearly calculating way. “You think 
this’ll be good for my career, Mr. 
Amory? I wouldn’t want to disap- 
point my public.” 

“I’ll put it to you squarely: aside 
from the fifty thousand or so you’d 
no doubt draw for this one-shot 
appearance on my drama hour, 
you’d be laying down assurance 
against the future. Look, Furley: 
you’re not the only homespun man 
on the air now. Rod Garson draws 
quite a rating with the Universal 
network, and there are plenty of 
others. You can’t last in the top 
spot forever. Someday you’ll 
stumble. Well, there’ll always be a 
future for you in drama. Capitalize 
now. When you appear on my 
show, you’ll draw not only my 
regular viewers but yours as well; 
we’ll double the rating.” 

“And when and if I fold up as 
a lasso-twirler,” Furley said 



smoothly, “I can always point to 
that night’s rating and tell the vice- 
presidents, ‘Looky here, see what 
happened the last time I played a 
straight role.’ I think I begin to 
understand your point of view, 
Amory. But it’s this return favor 
that worries me.” 

Amory firmed his jaw and said, 
“You never get anything for 
nothing in video. I’m just asking 
you to make a few innocent re- 
marks on your show.” 

“Subversion, Mr. Amory. Devia- 
tion.” 

“What of it? Nobody’ll notice. 
You’ll be hitting the viewers so deep 
they won’t know about it until it’s 
done.” Amory took a deep breath 
and plunged ahead. “After all, how 
did you convince them you were a 
loyal family man, Furley, when it’s 
practically common knowledge 
you’ve been keeping a mistress in 

jj 

“Okay,” Furley cut in roughly. 
“You play a hard game, Mr. Dir- 
ector Amory. And I don’t know 
what your point is, but we have a 
deal. You sign me up for lead role 
in one of your plays, and on my 
program I’ll guarantee to slip a 
couple of subversive remarks in. 
But I’m warning you that they’ll be 
subtle. There won’t be anything 
overt in it. I’m damned if I’ll get 
myself thrown off the air out of 
this.” 

Gone was the homespun philoso- 
pher now; Furley was all business, 
and tough at it. Amory extended a 
hand. “Subtlety is what we want. 
It has to be that way. Deal?” 
“Deal,” Furley said, as he shook 
hands. 

43 



AND THE WALLS CAME TUMBLING DOWN 




Amory monitored the Hal Furley 
show the following week, forcing 
himself to listen to the endless 
reams of guff and to endure the bad 
guitar-playing for nearly an hour, 
wondering whether Furley was 
going to back out on the deal or 
not. A contract offering Furley $45,- 

000 for a one-shot appearance on 
the drama hour, with return op- 
tions, lay unsigned in Amory’ s desk, 
ready to go out. 

The show was nearly over. Sud- 
denly, between guitar-strums, Fur- 
ley grinned in that deadly winning 
way of his and said, “My grandad 
was a great one for travelling. He 
went darned near around the world 
in his day — he died back in ’ninety- 
eight, or maybe it was ought-one, 

1 forget now — and he used to sing 
me some pretty fine songs from the 
lands over the water. I recall one 
old English tune I learned pretty 
near at the old man’s knee, when I 
was in rompers — ” 

Furley launched into something 
Amory barely recognized as Green- 
sleeves, heavily disguised by the 
comic’s customary style of guitar- 
embroidery. Beneath the twanging 
chords and the steady repetitive 
beat, Amory was able to distinguish 
the familiar old sinuous melody, and 
he smiled. 

Furley would get his contract. 
The seed had been planted; the 
first attack on the walls of the world 
was under way. Just the merest hint 
that there was a land across the 
waters that could possibly produce 
a song worthy of being played on 
the air by Hal Furley was the sort 
of below-the-threshold assault need- 
ed now. 

44 



Later, he could afford to be more 
open about things. Right now cau- 
tion was necessary, until the cam- 
paign was well under way. 

The next step was to call Rod 
Garson, the rival network’s com- 
petitor to Furley, and let him know 
gratuitously that Furley had taken 
a new tack and was plugging for 
internationalism. Garson was quick 
to imitate any idea Furley devel- 
oped; soon Universal would catch 
the fever. 

Amory had other plans as well. 
He smiled. Directing this campaign 
required the finesse needed to direct 
a classic play — and Amory felt 
much the same thrill he might have 
felt working with Racine or Mo- 
liere. The gradual building of a 
hundred small effects, minute nu- 
ances, half-noticed subtleties, to- 
ward one grand climax — this pro- 
duction, Amory thought warmly, 
will be my greatest directorial tri- 
umph! 



T HREE WEEKS passed. They 
were weeks of complex maneu- 
vering on many levels, of careful, 
meticulously-planned placement of 
overtones here and there in various 
video shows. Amory took to con- 
spiracy like a born plotter. 

He kept up his daily contact with 
Cargh, and while he was in the 
silent office all was serene; he and 
the alien methodically plodded 
through the world’s art, and Amory 
exerted such control over himself 
that he scarcely even thought of 
Cargh’ s true purpose while in the 
alien’s presence. He found himself 
growing to like the strange being, 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 




in a curious way: Cargh had a 
bright boundless eagerness to learn 
which impressed Amory, and he 
was openly friendly and cheerful. 

Behind the scenes at Transvideo 
Tower he worked furiously and 
long, occasionally drawing an actor 
aside to communicate a special 
shade of meaning, several times 
changing a line entirely at the final 
rehearsal. Luckily Kavanagh and 
Graben kept their attention else- 
where, giving Amory more freedom 
than he might have had had they 
attended all rehearsals as they 
sometimes did. 

And the Relaxomat, his ear to 
the world, gave signs of the change. 
Stray fragments of discussion 
reached him: an occasional ques- 
tioning of the policy of isolation, 
perhaps a remark that Amory knew 
evolved directly from one of his 
network plants. 

He saw his work taking hold, and 
he felt pleased. The temper of the 
times was shifting. And there still 
was plenty of time left before Cargh 
and his collections departed and 
the invasion army arrived. 

Hal Furley appeared on an Am- 
ory-directed show scripted by Lee 
Nourse, and all ratings jumped 
astronomically. Furley, Nourse, and 
Amory drew bonuses and plaudits 
from Graben; Kavanagh remained 
in the background, a gray figure 
with little praise in him. 

Amory met occasionally with 
Beckett, Nourse, Viglan, and some 
of the others who formed the chief 
backbone of anti-isolation agita- 
tion. They were full of ideas, brim- 
ming with enthusiasm — but Amory 
quickly saw that all looked to him 



for leadership. He was the only one 
in a direct position to act, by virtue 
of his position in the network; the 
others were hampered by the Script- 
ing Committee and by other forms 
of censorship. 

The days passed. Amory received 
a Matt Viglan script called Pride 
Leads To A Fall in which no less 
than four buried internationalist 
references had survived the Script- 
ing Committee’s hatchet, and set to 
work preparing it for the following 
week’s production. A sudden phone- 
call jarred him out of his concentra- 
tion. 

He snapped on the phone. “Yes? 
Who is it, please?” 

As if in answer, the square, un- 
attractive face of Dave Kavanagh 
appeared on the screen. The Script- 
ing Committee pundit looked even 
less cheerful than usual, his hard 
eyes flickering rapidly and his thin 
lips tight and pale. 

“What is it, Dave? I’m busy with 
this new Viglan script,” Amory said 
irritably. “The staging still isn’t 
worked out, and — ” 

“Could you stop over here to see 
me?” Kavanagh asked quietly. 

Amory shrugged. “I’ll be at the 
studio by eight or so for the re- 
hearsal. Suppose I look in on you 
about seven-thirty, thereabouts? 
Okay?” 

“No,” Kavanagh said. “I’d like 
to see you right now.” 

Something in his tone told Amory 
not to argue. Inwardly fuming, he 
said, “I’ve got an appointment for 
this afternoon, Dave. Is it that ur- 
gent?” 

“Yes. How urgent is this appoint- 
ment?” 

45 



AND THE WALLS CAME TUMBLING DOWN 




“So-so.” 

“Break it, then. I’ll expect you in 
an hour.” 

Amory felt sweat cascading down 
his abruptly cold skin. High as his 
own rank was, Kavanagh still out- 
ranked him in the hierarchy — and 
strict observance of hierarchical or- 
der was the law in video custom and 
ethos. Kavanagh very rarely pulled 
rank on Amory; there probably was 
some good and special reason for 
it now. Amory had his ideas about 
that reason, and he hoped he was 
wrong. 

Kavanagh sat behind a broad 
realwood desk polished so brightly 
the glare made Amory wince. There 
was nothing at all friendly in the 
Scripting Committee chairman’s 
manner or voice as he said, “Sit 
down, John. Have a cigarette.” 

Mechanically Amory accepted 
the cigarette and flicked the igniting 
capsule with a careless gesture of 
his thumb. He puffed twice, then 
waited. 

Kavanagh said, “I have a script 
here. Lee Nourse turned it in this 
morning. Perhaps you know that I 
read all scripts submitted by our 
staff writers personally, and make 
recommendations to the Committee 
concerning the necessary changes 
they must make.” 

“I know,” Amory said. 

Kavanagh drew a stiff green 
cardboard folder from his desk and 
flipped it open. A stack of neatly- 
typed white paper lay within. Rea- 
ding upside-down, Amory caught 
the title: Mr. Miller Meets Love , 
by Lee Nourse. That much was 
harmless enough. Amory wondered 

46 



just what Nourse had put in the 
script. 

Kavanagh referred to a slip of 
pencil notations clipped to the 
folder. “I’ve been through this 
play very carefully — with the same 
care I give to every play that crosses 
this desk, especially when it’s by- 
lined Lee Nourse. This is a very in- 
teresting script. There are no less 
than seven different specifically in- 
ternationalist references in here, 
plus one bit of dialogue that’s sheer 
deviationism of the most flagrant 
kind. The play is immoral. The 
writing is sloppy. It’s the sort of job 
that makes an old theater man like 
myself wince, John. I can’t even 
refer it to committee.” 

“Nourse’s contract calls for a 
standard reject allowance, doesn’t 
it?” Amory said tightly. “Why 
trouble me over a lousy script? I’m 
not Nourse’s agent.” 

Kavanagh smiled, and it was not 
a pleasant smile. Yellow skew-set 
teeth flashed before Amory’s eyes. 
Unlike Van Graben, Kavanagh had 
never bothered to have his choppers 
replaced by a neat white video- 
executive type plate. “To answer 
the first of your three questions 
first, John, Nourse’s contract no 
longer calls for anything. I revoked 
his contract an hour ago, and he’s 
not connected with this network 
as of that moment. The deviation- 
ist clause, naturally. His work has 
been unbearably beyond the line.” 

Amory scowled, but said nothing. 
Nourse had been anticipating the 
axe for weeks. Probably he had 
gone too far in this script, perhaps 
deliberately inviting trouble. 

“Secondly, John, and also third- 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 




ly, I’m troubling you about this 
script because I detect a certain 
unhealthy trend in your own work. 
For example: last Wednesday’s pro- 
duction, I understand, contained 
four lines that were not in the ap- 
proved script which left this office.” 
“I don’t know anything about 
that at — ” 

“The lines,” Kavanagh continued 
levelly, drawing a typed sheet of 
paper from a desk drawer, “referred 
to a type of food sold in Latin- 
American countries, to rice, the 
staple food of most oriental ones, 
to an incident in English history, 
and to the alleged immoral behavior 
of French women. Four clearcut in- 
ternationalist references, all of them 
inserted by your actors after the 
script was cleared by me.” 

Amory was hardly listening. He 
was studying the bulge of Kava- 
nagh’s outsized ears, his wide thin- 
lipped mouth, his acne-ravaged 
cheeks. Kavanagh’s thin icy voice 
droned on. “Strangely enough, 
John, I’ve checked back and found 
this sort of thing fairly common in 
your last two or three productions. 
And even more odd is the fact 
that they’ve been cropping up on 
Hal Furley’s show, since not long 
after Furley starred in your pro- 
gram of May 4.” 

Amor/s throat felt dry. “Just 
what are you getting at, Dave? Are 
you calling me a deviationist?” 
“I’m merely warning you, not 
calling you anything . yet. You’re 
one of our finest properties, John. 
I wouldn’t want you to go the way 
of Ted Beckett and Lee Nourse.” 
“You’re accusing me indirectly 
of subversive activities. You’re 



blaming me for these things that 
cropped up on my shows.” 

“I’m not,” Kavanagh snapped. 
“Don’t put words in my mouth. I’m 
simply bringing to your attention 
certain unhappy lapses, and ex- 
pressing the hope that you’ll find 
some way of avoiding them in the 
future. Otherwise — ” 

“Otherwise what?” 

“Otherwise we’d regretfully have 
to terminate your contract, John. 
That would hurt us. We respect 
you and your abilities. You’re a 
talent , John, and that’s rare in this 
business. You’re a real talent.” 
“Don’t give me the standard 
video borax,” Amory blazed. “It 
doesn’t sound very convincing com- 
ing from you, Kavanagh.” 

“All right,” Kavanagh said in a 
very quiet voice that held more of 
a whipsnap to it than any amount 
of bluster. “I’ll lay it on the line: 
we’re going to monitor your pro- 
grams pretty closely from here on. 
If we have to, we’ll pitch you right 
out of here. This industry can’t put 
up with any subversion. We don’t 
want any goddam deviationists pol- 
luting our viewers’ minds with filth 
and intellectualist garbage. Got 
that?” 

“I’ve got it,” Amory said. 
“Thanks for being explicit, Dave.” 
“You’re welcome. And I hope 
you were listening to what I said, 
Amory. You’re not so big that we 
can’t break you. I have Graben’s 
approval for every word I just said. 
We’ve been watching you a long 
time. We don’t tolerate this sort 
of stuff. We’ve got an obligation 
to our viewers. We’ve got to think 
of our clients. We — ”

“You’re foaming at the mouth, 
Dave. Calm down.” 

Amory grinned at the scriptman, 
stubbed the butt of his cigarette 
into the satin finish of Kavanagh’s 
desk, spun on his heel and left. 

He caught the dropshaft to his 
own private office some ten floors 
below Kavanagh’s. There, he dialed 
Nourse’s number. As soon as the 
writer’s wiry face appeared on the 
screen Amory said, “Kavanagh just 
called me on the carpet. He told 
me he fired you.” 

“About an hour ago. I guess I 
tried a few tricks too many in that 
last script. I’ll manage, though — 
my agent may arrange for me to 
do scripts for Universal at half 
price, under another name.” 

“Good. But Kavanagh’s wise to 
me. To all of us.” 

“What did he say?” 

Briefly, Amory told him. Nourse 
scowled fitfully at the account and 
finally said, “We don’t have much 
time left, in other words. You’re 
liable to get the hook any day now, 
John.” 

“I know.” Wildly, Amory won- 
dered for an instant whether it 
was worth all t^is, the frantic con- 
spiratorial plotting and the sacri- 
fices, the giving up of his post. He 
shoved the thought away. “How 
much cash can we round up im- 
mediately?” 

“It takes five hundred thousand 
to buy a ninety-minute spot,” 
Nourse said. “I can’t kick in too 
much, in view of my present un- 
employment, but I can scrape up 
thirty thousand, say. Viglan’s good 
for a hundred thousand. You?” 

48 



“I’ll go for a hundred thousand 
too. Beckett can’t help much, but 
Hersch Kyman should come 
across.” 

“We’ll make it,” Nourse said. 
“I’ll do the script. You round up 
the actors. We’ll let Viglan handle 
the actual negotiation for the time- 
spot, through his agent, since he’s 
the only one of us that’s in really 
good odor, as far as we know.” 
Nourse grinned and added, “We’ll 
knock ’em over, John. We’ll really 
finish ’em.” 

“I hope so,” Amory said. 

The show was titled No More 
Barriers , a 90-minute video extrava- 
ganza, and all media were satur- 
ated with preliminary notices for 
weeks. Amory and Nourse had man- 
aged to raise over a million for the 
production, of which nearly half 
went simply to buy time from 
Transvideo, and the rest was con- 
sumed in advertising and salaries. 
Director, scripter, and some of the 
cast worked without pay, which 
eased things. 

The production aroused tremen- 
dous interest as broadcast day drew 
near. The names of John Amory 
and Hal Furley were most promin- 
ently linked with it, Amory as di- 
rector, Furley as star. Furley would 
not appear in it, and Amory had 
known that from the start. The 
people who took part in No More 
Barriers would be, without excep- 
tion, ending their careers in enter- 
tainment that night. Furley would 
not care to jeopardize his future — 
but he accepted $30,000 for the 
use of his name in the advance 
billing, with the understanding that 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 




at the conclusion of the show it 
would be announced he had “with- 
drawn” from the production. 

Amory talked him into it. Furley’s 
name would be a tremendous asset : 
certainly people would tune in in 
hopes of seeing him, and would stay 
with the show at least for the first 
ten minutes. Those were the min- 
utes that mattered. 

As for the sponsors of the pro- 
gram, all the network or anyone 
knew was that an outfit called 
The League for Freedom had pur- 
chased the time. Video time was for 
sale to the highest bidder; the man 
who had actually handled the nego- 
tiations, an agent named Bartirone, 
had signed a document pledging 
that his client did not plan to pre- 
sent a show that was either athe- 
istic, immoral, subversive, or devia- 
tionist, and that was all the insur- 
ance the network needed. Some- 
what later, The League for Free- 
dom declined to make use of the 
facilities of the Scripting Commit- 
tee. 

“Kavanagh seemed pretty nasty 
about it,” Bartirone reported to 
Amory. “He insisted everyone used 
the Committee, and that no show 
went on the air without a Com- 
mittee stamp of approval. But 
there’s nothing in our purchase 
contract that requires us to feed 
our copy through Kavanagh. He 
says it’ll help in case of legal 
troubles later.” 

“Tell him,” Amory said, “that 
the League has enough money to 
handle any lawsuits that might 
arise, and so we’d just as soon skip 
routing the script through Commit- 
tee.” 



Kavanagh was told. He objected, 
but to his astonishment found there 
was no way to force a sponsor into 
making use of the Committee, if 
the sponsor declined. 

Amory rehearsed his crew of 
actors and ex-actors in the morn- 
ings, saw Cargh in the afternoons, 
and worked on his regular produc- 
tions in the evenings. It was a 
strenuous schedule, but he survived 
it. He hired a detective agency to 
locate a certain one-legged ex-actor 
now panhandling for a living in 
Manhattan, and when they turned 
the man up Amory offered him five 
thousand to play a major role in 
the production. He accepted. 

Slowly everything took shape. 
Ted Beckett wrote up a Proclama- 
tion of Human Friendship, and a 
printer was found who would print 
the deviationist document. Presses 
turned day and night; a bombard- 
ment of a hundred million was pre- 
pared, a fleet of helicopters engaged 
to disseminate them from the air. 

Amory lived his life in rigid chan- 
nels. He kept the part of him that 
dealt with Cargh blocked off from 
the part that prepared a weekly 
video script, and both of them 
from the part that labored over No 
More Barriers each morning. The 
days skipped by. Telefax banners 
screamed, TONIGHT’S THE 
NIGHT! DON’T MISS THE 
VIDEO SENSATION OF THE 
YEAR! 

At the Relaxomat, Amory heard 
them talking: “You going to be 
watching that thing tomorrow 
night?” 

“Guess so. After all this publicity, 
why not?” 



AND THE WALLS CAME TUMBLING DOWN 



49 




“That’s the way I feel. I’m pretty 
damn curious about the show, 
y’know?” 

Thursday came. Hours crawled 
by. Amory begged off his appoint- 
ment with Cargh and spent the 
afternoon in a Relaxomat, fruit- 
lessly trying to drain off the ac- 
cumulated tension. 

At seven-thirty he caught a cab 
uptown to the studio. This was one 
show he planned to attend. 

HE SHOW EMANATED 
from the thirty-fourth floor 
studio of the Transvideo Tower. 
This was a secondary studio, not 
often used, which Amory had 
chosen because of its special 
physiognomy: unlike the big up- 
stairs studios, this one could be 
completely sealed off from un- 
wanted visitors. And certainly it 
would be necessary to hold off the 
network men for as long as possible, 
once they caught the opening se- 
quences of the show. 

Three of Amory’s cast stood 
guard at the narrow entrance to 
the studio. They let him in without 
question. 

One of them said, “Mr. Graben 
was around here a little while ago. 
He didn’t say what he wanted.” 

“Did you let him in?” 

“Of course not. He didn’t even 
ask.” 

“Good,” Amory said. “If Kava- 
nagh shows up, tell him I’m not 
around. No — wait a second. Call 
me if Kavanagh gets here.” 

He went inside. Viglan was there 
already, and Lee Nourse, and Ted 

50 



Beckett and a few others. Amory 
joined them. 

“You have any difficulty getting 
into the studio?” he asked. 

Nourse shook his head. “I just 
showed my sponsors’ pass. They 
didn’t believe it, but they couldn’t 
argue.” 

Amory had equipped the shadier 
members of the outfit with passes 
designating them as Client Repre- 
sentatives ; there was no turning 
away a sponsor, even if he happened 
to be Ted Beckett. 

Amory looked at the time. Still 
three quarters of an hour to show 
time. He said, “All the cameramen 
ready and at their posts?” 

Nourse nodded. “They’re here 
and setting up. They don’t know 
they’re going to be transmitting a 
deviationist show yet, but they will 
soon enough.” He pointed to three 
cast extras. “Those guys will stand 
behind them all during the show. 
I don’t think they’ll give any 
trouble.” 

“And we’ll lock off the control 
room, of course,” said Beckett. 
“They won’t be able to stop us 
without cutting the main trunk line. 
And that’ll take time, of course.” 

Amory nodded abstractedly. Now 
that they were almost on the brink 
of it, he felt calm, untroubled. He 
caught sight of his leading actors 
standing near a camera boom, 
walked toward them, ran them 
briefly through their key lines. 

Ten minutes before show- time, 
someone touched his sleeve and 
said, “Mr. Kavanagh’s here, sir.” 

“Alone?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Good. Show him in here, and 
ROBERT SILVERBERG 





lock the studio door behind him.” 
Amory grinned. “Then round up 
some good heavy rope. You under- 
stand?” 

Kavanagh came striding through 
the busy studio like a gale wind, 
pushing everyone in his way to one 
side. When he reached Amory he 
said, without preamble, “What the 
hell kind of stunt is this, Amory?” 

“I’m afraid I don’t follow you, 
Dave.” 

“I’m afraid you do! The studio 
police downstairs told me that 
Nourse and Beckett were here with 
sponsors’ passes! How the hell did 
that happen? And who are all these 
actors? Not an Equity man in the 
lot! Why didn’t you let me see the 
script for this show?” He scowled 
and demanded finally, “What kind 
of production is this, anyway?” 

“It’s a ninety-minute deviationist 
extravaganza,” Amory said in a 
gentle voice. “It’s going to be fun, 
I think.” 

Kavanagh took a step backward. 
For a moment he seemed struck 
speechless. Then he said, “A — de- 
viationist — show? John, don’t joke 
with me.” 

“I told you the living truth,” 
Amory said. 

Kavanagh came to life suddenly. 
He whirled and ran toward the 
door, shouting, “You’re all under 
Security arrest! This is treason! 
This show can’t go on the air!” 

He reached the roadblock near 
the door. “Hold him, boys,” Amory 
said, in his quiet commanding 
voice. 

Two actors appeared and gripped 
Kavanagh tightly. Amory drew 



near and saw the Scripting Com- 
mittee man’s whitened face working 
in impotent rage. “Let go of him,” 
Amory said. 

Kavanagh broke loose and Am- 
ory grabbed him. He was nearly a 
foot taller than Kavanagh, and 
twice as heavy. “Let go of my arm,” 
Kavanagh snapped. “You’re all un- 
der arrest. As soon as I get out of 
here—” 

“You’re not getting out of here,” 
Amory said, and smashed his balled 
fist against Kavanagh’s cheek. The 
impact stung; Kavanagh spun a- 
way, face livid with fury, and aimed 
a wobbly blow at Amory’s middle. 
Amory blocked it with a down- 
chopping motion of his left arm, 
brought his other hand quickly up 
and cracked it off the point of 
Kavanagh’s chin. Kavanagh started 
to fold ; Amory hit him in the 
stomach and the smaller man col- 
lapsed. 

“Tie him up and dump him in 
the prop room,” Amory ordered. 
“Keep the studio doors locked.” He 
looked at his watch. “Places, every- 
one. It’s two minutes to show time. 
We’re ready to get started.” 

He took a place at the back of 
the studio, and the white-faced, 
startled cameramen unlimbered 
their machines. No More Barriers 
was ready to roll. 

The show opened with a brief 
word of greeting and a prologue, 
a quick historical preview. A man 
carefully chosen for the vigor and 
force of his delivery told of the 
original split between the hemis- 
pheres after the Second World War, 
how as years passed and new wea- 

51 



AND THE WALLS CAME TUMBLING DOWN 




pons were developed an actual war 
became impossible, but an ideolog- 
ical one continued on a level of 
increasing bitterness. 

He went on to explain how the 
wave of isolationism had spread 
through the country during the past 
generation, how in a sudden turtle- 
like maneuver America had cut 
itself off from all contact with the 
nations across the sea. 

So far, just history. Then: “These 
barriers have been in force too long. 
The time has come, we believe, for 
them to come down — for the world 
once again to be united in harmony, 
with free commerce and contact 
between the nations.” 

Enter four scantily-clad girls in- 
tended as representatives of other 
nations, to cloak the sting of that 
bluntly deviationist statement. A 
brief pageant began. The studio 
phone rang. 

‘Til get it,” Amory said, heading 
toward the soundproof booth. He 
picked up. Graben’s face appeared 
in the screen, and for once the 
executive had lost his glossy calm. 

“John, what the deuce is going 
on in there? Why is the studio door 
tacked?” 

Amory shrugged. “It simplifies 
things. Why?” 

“You can’t let that deviationist 
filth go out,” Graben said. “Where’s 
Kavanagh?” 

“Right here in the studio. But 
you can’t talk to him; he had a 
little accident and we had to tie him 
up to keep him from hurting him- 
self.” 

Graben sputtered incoherently. 
“We’ll cut you off! We’ll throw you 
all in prison for years! John, are 

52 



you insane? Why are you doing 
this?” 

“Just for the devil of it,” Amory 
said cheerfully, and clicked off. He 
left the booth and collared Nourse 
and Beckett almost immediately. 

“Graben just called. He’s been 
monitoring the show from upstairs 
and he’s raging mad. We’re going 
to get cut off any minute.” 

“It’ll take at least ten minutes 
for them to reach the main trunk 
line. By that time the damage’ll be 
done,” Nourse said. “It’ll take ten 
minutes before the security boys get 
here. The second we get cut off, 
John, you tell everyone to run for 
it. They can’t round all of us up.” 

Amory smiled. “Poor Graben 
must be having a fit! A hundred 
million viewers gobbling up all this 
deviationism!” 

The program lasted exactly six- 
teen minutes, which was six more 
than Nourse had been figuring on 
when he wrote the script. Already 
more outright internationalist pro- 
paganda had gone forth in those 
sixteen minutes than America had 
heard publicly in a quarter of a 
century. 

Amory sat in the middle of a 
tight, eager group at the back of 
the studio, watching the show un- 
fold. He felt warm satisfaction: 
this, his final video show, was his 
best. The actors, not an Equity man 
in the tat (though most had held 
cards at one time or another, before 
getting bounced on deviationist 
charges) responded perfectly, 
bringing out the hidden nuances 
Amory so loved and which were so 
necessary in a production of this 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 




kind. They entered and left camera- 
range as if guided by the hand of a 
master conductor. 

And as for the impact this show 
was probably having on a nation so 
accustomed to believe what they 
saw on the video — Amory was un- 
able to estimate that. The foes of 
internationalism had relied simply 
and purely on a negative approach. 
By censoring any possible inter- 
nationalist reference, they had 
thought they were preserving isola- 
tionism. Instead, they had withered 
it. Amory wondered how the vari- 
ous polling agencies would report. 

Eighteen minutes. Nineteen. 

“Graben’s probably got the trunk 
line reached by now,” Nourse said. 
A moment later, before anyone had 
a chance to agree or disagree, the 
lights flickered and went out; the 
ceiling-glow died last, a stubborn 
orange radiance slowly fading. 

Immediately Amory leaped to the 
seat of his chair and shouted, 
“Okay, folks. They finally cut us 
off, but I think we gave it to ’em 
good first. The thing to do now is 
to get out of here. WALK, don’t 
run, to the door — but once you’re 
outside, run like blazes, and in 
every direction. No two of you go 
the same way. They can’t catch 
us all.” 

He jumped off his chair. “Unlock 
that studio door,” he called. 

“What about Kavanagh?” 
Nourse asked. 

Amory shrugged. “We can’t use 
hostages. Leave him here. They’ll 
find him soon enough.” 

In the dimness he saw the studio 
door open; members of the cast 
were flooding through it, still in 



costume, some of the girls nearly 
nude, many of the men in out- 
landish foreign costumes. He stood 
watching the procession for a 
moment, until Nourse caught his 
hand. 

“Come on, John. You’re the one 
they’ll be most interested in getting; 
let’s go!” 

He started to run. He emerged 
in the hall and saw Graben and 
several other video network men 
shouting and gesturing at the flee- 
ing actors ; there was still no sign of 
the security men, which was en- 
couraging. 

“Keep away from the elevators!” 
Amory shouted. Probably they were 
manned by armed guards, and that 
would lead to trouble. He glanced 
at Nourse and said, “You go that 
way. We have to split up.” 

He started off in the opposite 
direction, down the shiny panelled 
corridor, past some executive’s of- 
fice, past a prop storeroom. He 
heard shouts behind him. 

Stairs. He plunged into the pho- 
ton-beam and descended three steps 
at a time, one hand gripping the 
bannister tightly. It takes a long 
time to run down thirty-four flights 
of stairs. He spiralled endlessly 
down and down, his long legs 
pistoning frantically. 

It was a strangely exhilarating 
feeling, this business of being a fugi- 
tive. His heart pounded; his senses 
seemed heightened. The sound of 
shouting grew more dim behind him 
with each passing flight. 

Gray Security Corps trucks were 
parked in front of the huge tower 
when he reached street level. 
Amory paused for an instant, suck- 

53 



AND THE WALLS CAME TUMBLING DOWN 




ing in great gasps of breath, and 
watched the Security men race into 
the building. He hoped most of the 
cast had already gotten free, and 
that they were on their way back 
to whatever slums they called home. 
He wondered what luck his one- 
legged star had had in escaping — 
and whether Beckett and Nourse 
would make it. 

He moved out of the cover of the 
building, and, even though it was 
a warm June night, drew his collar 
up around him. Perhaps they would 
recognize him because of his size; 
perhaps not. He knew that he would 
have to move, and move fast, until 
this was over. 

He ran north to 50th Street and 
there ducked into a service store. 
The proprietor was busy behind the 
food counter; Amory moved quietly 
and quickly toward the phone 
booths in the back of the store, 
without being noticed. 

He had to have someplace to go. 
It was certainly unsafe to return to 
his home this evening, and possibly 
he would never be able to go back 
there. Certainly he’d need to leave 
the immediate metropolitan area 
for a while. 

But he did have one recourse. 
He slipped a coin into the slot and 
dialed Cargh’s private number. 

He waited, anticipating the sight 
of the alien’s by-now-familiar fea- 
tures on the small old-fashioned 
booth screen. But the phone con- 
tinued to ring . thirteen, four- 
teen, fifteen times. Amory stared 
uncomprehendingly at his own re- 
flection in the still unlit screen. Why 
didn’t Cargh answer? Where could 

54 



the aliens possibly be? 

Exasperated, Amory hung up, 
dialed the operator, and gave her 
Cargh’s number. “It’s very impor- 
tant, and I can’t seem to make con- 
tact. Will you try for me?” 

“Certainly, sir,” came the imper- 
sonal machine-like tones. The 
screen remained dead, though — and 
a moment later the operator’s voice 
said, “I’m sorry, sir. That number 
has been withdrawn from the 
book.” 

“What’s that? What does that 
mean?” 

“That the party using that num- 
ber has left its present address, and 
does not wish to continue using 
telephone service, sir. I’m very sor- 
ry, sir. Is there anything else I can 
do for you, sir?” 

“No . no,” Amory said, frown- 
ing. He hung up and heard his coin 
tinkle down into the return box. 
Cargh gone? Where? Where? 

He pushed open the phone 
booth. The clock over the food 
counter said nine-thirty; it was only 
an hour since it had all begun, then. 
He shoved a nickel into a telefax 
slot, wondering if the nine o’clock 
edition said anything about the 
broadcast. 

The yellow sheet came rippling 
out of the wall-slot; Amory seized 
on it almost before its ink had 
dried, and scanned it. No, no men- 
tion of anything unusual on this 
evening’s video; either it was too 
early for the ’fax to report anything, 
or else they had decided deliberately 
to ignore the existence of the broad- 
cast. The latter was more likely, he 
thought. 

He slouched down behind the 
ROBERT SILVERBERG 




counter and ordered a seaflower 
sandwich. The store’s video set, he 
saw, was tuned to the Trans video 
Channel, but some insipid sort of 
variety show was in progress. 

He jerked a thumb toward the 
set. “Hey, Mac — isn’t that spec- 
tacular supposed to be on tonight? 
The thing about Barriers?” 

The man behind the counter was 
a timid-looking little man with a 
sharp chin and mild eyes, stained 
an unlikely pink by his contact 
lenses. He chuckled. “You mean 
you didn’t hear what happened?” 
Amory leaned forward. “Nope. 
What?” 

“Darned crazy show was all 
about the other countries of the 
world, and how we ought to get 
to know what they’re like. Stuff like 
that, y’know. Then fifteen- twenty 
minutes after it got going, they an- 
nounced ‘technical difficulties’ and 
cut it off.” The little man stared 
intently at Amory for a moment 
and added, in a low voice, “Just be- 
tween you ’n me and the man in the 
moon, friend, I’d say that program 
got censored. Like it was some- 
thing we weren’t supposed to hear.” 
“Sounds that way,” Amory 
agreed. 

“Too bad, too — lot of people 
were curious about that show, and 
came into the store to watch it. 
Lost all them customers when it got 
cut off.” 

Amory munched the sandwich. 
“Video folks are very careful about 
what they show, I guess.” 

“Mebbe too careful,” the coun- 
terman said. “Not that I want to 
imply — ” He paused meaningfully. 
“I gotcha,” Amory said. He paid 



his bill, tucked his collar up around 
his face, and stepped out into the 
moonless, starless night. 

A steady fluttering sound caught 
his attention ; he looked up and saw 
a helicopter hovering high above 
the city, its beating rotors holding 
it motionless. Something drifted out 
of the copter’s belly; a sheet of 
paper, it looked like, followed by 
others. 

The handbills, Amory thought. 

The copter moved on, as the air- 
borne sheets drifted slowly to Earth. 
They would be picked up; they 
would be read, and perhaps their 
message would sink in. 

Perhaps. Perhaps not. But it had 
been worth trying, all of it. 

The seed of deviation had been 
sown. Whether it would take root — 
that was yet to be seen. Amory 
looked up, past the building-tops, 
past the murky haze that cloaked 
the city, deep into the cloud- 
wrapped sky. No stars were visible 
in the darkness, but he knew they 
were there, bright dots beyond the 
dark. His heart sank as he thought 
of the giant task still ahead, before 
mankind would be ready to defend 
itself against Gargh and his fellows. 

He shook his head. Cargh would 
triumph; Earth would fall to the 
invaders. But at least , Amory 
thought, I tried . 1 tried. 

Suddenly he wanted to speak to 
Grigorescu again, to tell the Ru- 
manian of what he had done, per- 
haps to learn whether the aliens 
had also vanished from Rumania. 
And Levittown would be a good 
place to hide. He decided to go to 
the esper, Hadafield. 

He glanced around for the near-

AND THE WALLS CAME TUMBLING DOWN 




est transport depot. As he caught 
sight of the neon-lit kiosk, he heard 
a whistle scream shrilly behind him. 

“There he is!” someone yelled. 
“There’s Amory!” 

He began to run. 



T HE KIOSK WAS nearly half 
a block away. Footsteps clat- 
tered against the pavement behind 
him as he ran. Without looking 
back, he sprinted into the kiosk, 
down the stairs that parallelled the 
escalator and dropshafts, and leap- 
frogged the turnstile. No one 
stopped him. 

Panting, he reached the multiple 
passages that led to the cars and 
took the one whose glowing sign 
flashed ISLAND THRUWAY at 
him. He still heard the sound of 
pursuers as he raced up the escala- 
tor, not waiting for it to carry him, 
and emerged on the thruway level. 

He found a waiting car and 
entered. “Levittown, and fast, 
driver.” 

A second passed, while relays 
opened and closed in the main 
switching center of the transport 
system. The car slid into motion. 
For the first time, now, Amory 
looked back, and saw three shadowy 
figures in the grey of Security uni- 
forms appear on the Thruway plat- 
form, just as his cab shot away into 
the night. 

He watched the speedometer 
needle flicker its way up to 150 and 
stay there. The road was poorly lit 
— with automatic safety devices 
making crashes impossible, there 
was no need for unnecessary ex- 
penditures — and he had no way of 

56 



knowing whether or not he was 
being followed. There was time to 
lose pursuers in Levittown, he 
didn’t want to bring a trail of 
Security men straight to Hadafield. 

Towns whipped by on right and 
left. Amory realized dully that by 
committing himself to a public cab, 
he had left himself open for easy 
capture; if the police knew which 
car he was in, all they had to do 
was contact transport center, and 
have the car swivel off the Thru- 
way, turn back in the other direc- 
tion, and deliver him neatly to 
headquarters. There was no way of 
stopping the car from within, or of 
opening the doors until the driver 
chose to open them. 

But his fears were groundless. 
“Levittown,” the driver finally 
called out; the cab shot off the 
main limb of the Thruway and 
deposited him at the exit level. He 
paid his fare and sprang from the 
cab the instant the door opened. 

Here on Long Island, the night 
air in June was considerably cooler 
and less humid; he felt an immedi- 
ate chill. He descended to the pedes- 
trian level, glancing back occa- 
sionally. So far as he could tell, he 
was not being followed. 

He paused for a moment at the 
concrete base of the walkway, try- 
ing to remember the route they had 
taken to Hadafield’s house. Up the 
hill, past Red Maple Drive, and to 
the right. The streets were dim, un- 
lit. Amory wished he had brought 
some weapon along. 

He started cautiously toward the 
hill. Dim shapes moved ahead of 
him in the dark; Security men? 

No. Bandits. 



ROBERT SILVERBERG 




A light flashed in his eyes, and 
he felt the pressure of a bare knife 
against his stomach. “Hand over 
your wallet and you won’t get 
hurt,” a cold, quiet voice said. 

“The wallet’s yours,” Amory said. 
He wasn’t inclined to argue. “It’s 
in my right-hand trousers pocket.” 

The knife pricked a little deeper 
into flesh as a hand slipped into his 
pocket, drawing out the wallet. 
“Just take the money, will you?” 
Amory whispered. “There are 
identity cards in there, and it’ll be 
a devil of a nuisance trying to re- 
place them.” 

He heard a calm ugly chuckle. 
“We know that, friend. We find 
identity cards useful. Got the wallet, 
Bill?” 

An affirmative grunt from be- 
hind. 

The knife’s pressure eased. A fist 
slammed into Amory’s face; his 
head rocked back. Obviously they 
weren’t going to leave him con- 
scious. 

Suddenly a searchbeam spot- 
lighted the entire group. Amory saw 
the robbers clearly: two thin, un- 
shaven little men, their eyes glinting 
like foxes, their lips thin with hun- 
ger. Under cover of darkness they 
had seemed menacing ; revealed, 
they were merely pathetic. 

“Security men!” one robber whis- 
pered. “Let’s beat it!” 

“Hold it there, you!” came an 
authoritative cry. “Stay where you 
are.” 

The thief behind Amory suddenly 
stuck two fingers in his mouth and 
whistled, an astonishingly loud, 
piercing animal-like cry. A moment 
later, the whistle-cry resounded 



from seven or eight places further 
back in the darkness. 

“Cut that out!” ordered a Secur- 
ity man’s voice. “Amory, come out 
of there! We’ve got you!” 

Thwack! A bullet whistled out 
of the darkness and the Security 
man’s voice trailed off into a wet 
gurgle. A second bullet smashed the 
spotlight; a third cracked into a 
Security truck window. 

“Run for it, pal!” the thief at his 
side whispered, and, under cover 
of darkness, Amory ran. Honor 
among thieves, he thought grimly; 
rob him they might, but Security 
men were enemies to be feared, and 
friends in the night had saved him. 

Of course, he had no money, no 
identity cards now. But that hardly 
mattered, since John Amory as an 
identity would have to vanish from 
sight. 

He ran on, ignoring the silent 
shapes that scooted through the 
darkness, sometimes crossing his 
path. This was a jungle, he thought, 
thinking of two dead Security men 
lying near a truck by the pedestrian 
walkway. 

His breath came short. Almost by 
instinct he turned right at the 
proper corner, pounded up the 
street towards the esper’s house, 
and rang the right doorbell. He 
leaned forward, supporting himself 
by the doorframe, gasping for 
breath. Sweat drenched him. 

He looked back, seeing no pur- 
suers. The door slowly opened. 

“Hello, Mr. Amory. We’ve been 
expecting you for quite a while,” a 
quiet, mild voice said. 

Amory glanced into the darkness. 
“Thank God this is the right place, 



AND THE WALLS CAME TUMBLING DOWN 



57 




Hadafield! I—” 

He let the words die in his throat. 
The figure in the doorway was not 
the esper Gill Hadafield. 

It was the alien. Cargh. 

Hands gathered him in, led him 
inside. He heard the door lock be- 
hind him, heard the sound of a 
doorchain being snapped into place 
and a bolt slammed home. 

He smelled the faintly musty 
odor of rotting woodwork that 
characterized the ancient houses 
out here in Levittown. He made 
no attempt to think ; he merely 
soaked in sense-perceptions, letting 
all thoughts drift by him. He sensed 
the darkness, the smell, noises out- 
side, then the sound of friendly 
voices. 

He was in Hadafield’s small, 
cramped room. Someone was hold- 
ing a cup to his lips, and he drank. 
The taste was acrid but yet pleas- 
ant; it was a taste he had experi- 
enced before. The German wine, he 
realized. He sipped again, feeling 
the chilled wine glide down his 
throat. 

Finally he looked around. He saw 
familiar faces: Lee Nourse, Ted 
Beckett, Matt Viglan, the esper 
Hadafield. They were staring 
anxiously at him. 

There was no sign of the alien. 

“Cargh?” he asked. “I thought 
I saw Cargh here when I came in. 
You know. The alien.” 

He swivelled on his chair to peer 
into the cobwebbed recesses of the 
room, but no alien was present. 

“I thought he was here,” Amory 
half-muttered to himself. “Halluci- 
nation. The strain, the running, 

58 



everything — it must have been 
hallucination.” 

“No” Lee Nourse said. “No hal- 
lucination at all.” 

And suddenly Cargh stood be- 
fore him, smilingly blandly, a look 
of shrewd coldness in his three ice- 
flecked eyes. 

“There he is! Don’t you see 
him?” 

“Of course we see him,” Nourse 
said. “Gill, turn him off, will you?” 

As Amory watched, the tall, 
darkly handsome figure of the alien 
wavered and grew indistinct; the 
sharp outlines of the alien face 
flickered, the deep blue of the skin 
paled and seemed to wear thin, 
until patches of the room beyond 
could be seen through Cargh. Then 
one last flicker and the alien was 
gone. 

“What — where’d he go?” Amory 
asked. He knew, deep within him- 
self. that something was wrong; 
one small portion of his mind re- 
tained its old acuteness, the rest 
was numbed and fatigued by his 
frantic flight. Desperately he fought 
to reestablish control over his mind, 
like a drunken man struggling to 
focus his eyes to read the words that 
might mean his life. 

“I think we owe you some ex- 
planations, John,” Nourse said 
gently. 

With one last effort Amory won: 
he drew his shattered consciousness 
together. “I think you do,” he said, 
with something of his old force. 
He looked expectantly at Nourse. 

“It began the night of Ted’s last 
movie showing,” Nourse said. “At 
least, that’s when we put it into 

BOB SILVERBERG 




effect. We had planned it for a 
while — ever since we met Hada- 
field, here. 

“What we did was to drug you 
— yes, it was the wine we used — 
and carry you into Ted’s back 
room. Hadafield went to work on 
you there, setting up the hypnotic 
illusion we were going to use. Then 
I rode you downtown to the office 
we’d rented for the purpose. I 
waited around for you to wake up, 
and that’s when you first met 
Cargh.” 

“There aren’t any aliens, then,” 
Amory said. He realized his fingers 
were quivering. “It’s all a giant 
pipe-dream?” 

Nourse looked slightly shame- 
faced. “More or less. We took turns 
posing as Cargh. Hadafield so set 
you up that whenever any of us 
performed the triggering gesture, 
you’d be seeing the alien and not 
us. Matt Viglan was Cargh most of 
the time; Ted would have been, 
except that he was raided.” 

“And you led me through that 
whole monkeyshine about collect- 
ing Earth’s art, and had me reel 
off list after list after list of non- 
sense?” 

“That was incidental. We had to 
have some excuse, John. The key 
maneuver was ‘accidentally’ letting 
you find that memorandum discuss- 
ing the forthcoming conquest of 
the Earth. That was your trigger; 
that was the thing that would 
finally jolt you into action.” 

Amory was quite calm ; he stared 
levelly at Nourse, trying to fit all 
the pieces together. “You deliber- 
ately instilled in me the hypnotic 
delusion that I was meeting regu- 



larly with an alien being, and just 
as deliberately gave me the impres- 
sion that the Earth was in danger.” 
He had not started to get angry yet; 
it was all too incomprehensible still. 
He took a deep breath. “Why?” 
“Because tonight’s video produc- 
tion would never have come into 
existence any other way,” Nourse 
said sharply. “You were the only 
man. You were big enough and 
strong enough to carry the project 
over, and you weren’t directly sub- 
ject to interference from Kavanagh 
the way we were. But we couldn’t 
approach you directly. You never 
would have agreed.” 

Amory leaned back, shaking his 
head slowly. He understood, now. 
He began to laugh. 

These men were his friends. They 
had known him — known how his 
fatalistic approach to the problems 
of the world had led him to adopt 
a what’s-the-use attitude, led him 
to withdraw within himself into a 
state of bitter resigned despair. 

He had been the only man who 
could set in motion the wheels that 
might lead to the breakdown of the 
barriers between nations — and he 
had refused to act, preferring in- 
stead a cynical self-withdrawal. 

So they had tampered with his 
mind. They had projected him 
into a fantastic dream-world, and 
through the dream-world had con- 
vinced him at last of the necessity 
of immediate action. 

“I should be angry,” he said, 
looking at the small men all around 
him, the thin, wiry men who had 
rightly assessed him and taken it 
upon themselves to catapult him 
(Continued, on page 117)

He carried the monkey of fear on his back for 



all to see ; and until he could shake the beast 



he knew he would be a captain in name only . 



Captain PEABODY 



T HE GAVEL rapped sharply, and the murmur of conver- 
sation throughout the banquet room drifted into hushed 
silence. The occasion was the seventy-fifth meeting of 
RETSCAP, the organization of Retired Space Captains; the 
place, a banquet room in the Empire Club on the hundred and 
sixty-fourth floor of the New Empire State Building in Man- 
hattan; the time, approximately nine thirty in the evening, 
August 9, 2231 A.D.; those present, the four hundred and 
eighteen members of RETSCAP — or rather, four hundred 
and nineteen, including the new member, Captain Arthur 
Peabody, who had reached his ninety-fifth birthday just two 
weeks before, and by doing so had been automatically retired 
from active service and thereby become eligible for member-

ship while still in the prime of life. him. “Captain Peabody,” he said 

“Quiet everybody,” the Secretary in his loud clear voice, “The time 

and master of ceremonies, Captain has come for fulfillment of a tradi- 

John Evers, said good-naturedly, tional part of our get-togethers — 

rapping the gavel again. He turned one we all look forward to with 

to the new member, sitting next to great pleasure and anticipation.” 



61 





There was a subdued clapping of 
hands, then Captain Evers cleared 
his throat loudly and continued. 
“Each of us here has become a 
member of RETSCAP only after a 
lifetime of space travel, much of 
that time as a Captain in charge of 
the destinies of our crews and 
passengers and ships. Inevitably 
each of us has had some unusual 
experiences in his time, and we like 
to talk about them, boring each 
other to death, no doubt, as we re- 
peat the same stories among our- 
selves meeting after meeting. So it’s 
always a treat to us to get a new 
member and by so doing get some 
fresh stories to listen to. I am about 
to give you the floor, and what we 
would like to hear is the one experi- 
ence you have had which you think 
is the most unusual, in some way, 
of your entire career. The floor is 
now yours, Captain Arthur Pea- 
body!” 

Arthur Peabody stood up slowly, 
a tall man, long legged and short 
bodied in his seven foot height, his 
sharply bridged nose and high fore- 
head giving his features the stamp 
of authority comfortably worn, and 
waited, a quiet smile on his firm 
lips, until the applause subsided. 
Then he began his speech. 

T HE ONE experience that 
stands out in my mind more 
than any other really began about 
five minutes after I was assigned to 
my first ship, the Alabama, when 
I was given the list of my officers 
and crew to check over. Half way 
down the list I came to a name, 
Oscar Resnick, and suddenly the 



thrill of being a captain was gone. 
For two cents, at that moment, I 
would gladly have become a retired 
Space Captain before I started. I 
was fifty-two years old then, and it 
had been about thirty years since 
I last saw Resnick. His rating was 
still spaceman first class, and I 
knew if he had ever risen higher he 
had been demoted again, as was in- 
evitable, sooner or later. He was an 
incurable bully with the worst 
streak of sadistic cruelty in him I’ve 
ever run across. 

Even the sight of his name on 
that list sent an instinctive fear 
through me. Once, when I was still 
a space recruit he had whipped me 
to within an inch of my life and 
instilled in me the realization that 
he could do it any time, anywhere. 

A man like that is slightly mad, 
or strikes you that way. You stay 
out of his way if you can, and if you 
can’t you let him have his way, 
swallow his insults, do anything to 
avoid the beating you would get if 
he took the whim. Live with that 
for two years as I had thirty years 
before, and you never get over it. 

Now I was captain of my first 
ship and he, was to be one of the 
crew. And I knew in my heart that 
if he walked up to me and suddenly 
reached up to scratch his head I 
would cringe and turn pale. I 
wouldn’t be able to help it. And 
if that happened it would be the 
end of me. The crew would think I 
was yellow — and I was when it 
came to Oscar Resnick. 

Oh, he wouldn’t do anything that 
would give me cause to toss him in 
the brig, nor even anything that 
would give me cause to fire him — at 



62 



ROG PHILLIPS 




least a reason that would stand up 
under a union inquiry if he de- 
manded one, which he would. He 
would just grin at me knowingly 
with eyes that told me he thought 
I was yellow, and hesitate just long 
enough after an order to make me 
wonder if he was going to obey — 
the kind of stuff that could break 
me down completely, in time. And 
there would be nothing I could do 
about it. 

I made a try to keep him off my 
crew. The Dispatcher admitted 
Resnick had the reputation of being 
a trouble maker, but if I didn’t take 
him there was likelihood the Union 
would call out the whole crew and 
ground the ship. 

Then the Dispatcher pointed out 
the fact that the list was short one 
man, my personal orderly. I hadn’t 
thought about an orderly at all, and 
hadn’t chosen one yet. He gave me 
the list of available orderlies and I 
looked it over, most of the names 
meaning nothing at all to me. Sud- 
denly I ran across a name I knew. 
I didn’t know the man, but I had 
heard of him, and probably all of 
you have. 

The name was David Markham. 
He was the David Markham all 
right, the Dispatcher said when I 
asked him — the one who was kicked 
out of Space Patrol for abject 
cowardice. The Dispatcher told me 
the man had been trying for two 
years to get back into space, the 
Union wouldn’t take him, and the 
only way he could get into service 
was an orderly to a Captain — if any 
Captain took him. 

The Dispatcher suggested two or 
three other men he knew personally, 

CAPTAIN PEABODY 



any one of which I would probably 
like and decide to keep permanent- 
ly. But a crazy idea was running 
around in my head. It was a clutch- 
ing at straws, but what it amounted 
to was this: I had a bully on my 
crew, a man who had my number 
and knew how to use it. Why not 
balance him out by making my one 
choice on the crew a man who was 
the exact opposite, an abject 
coward? Possibly, on some level 
of thought, I wanted company if 
Resnick showed me up to the crew, 
someone who couldn’t look down 
on me because of the simple fact 
that he was the lowest there was. 

The Dispatcher almost cried with 
happiness over my choice of David 
Markham. It turned out he was 
sorry for the guy, and felt only a 
man with real guts would have the 
courage to sign Markham on. He 
would certainly have been surprised 
if I had told him the truth. 

I met Markham the next morn- 
ing at seven o’clock when I returned 
to the Dispatch Office at Space- 
port, New Mexico. He was a fine 
looking fellow, twenty-five, rather 
short — just over the six foot four 
minimum of the Space Patrol, 
about one ninety mass, blonde, 
square jaw. I took a liking to him 
at once — but there was a haunting 
something at the back of his eyes 
that never went away even when 
he was smiling, and he smiled often 
during the time I knew him, though 
he never laughed but once — and it 
was a sound I never want to hear 
again. But that came much later. 

I sent him aboard with my bags 
to get my quarters in order, then 
steeled myself to check in the crew. 

63 




You know how it is, you sit at the 
window and the men come by, one 
at a time, you introduce yourself, 
fix his face in your mind, size him 
up, then call for the next man. 
Finally it was Oscar Resnick look- 
ing through the window at me, his 
thick shock of sandy red hair glued 
down, clean-shaven, six foot eight, 
about two hundred and forty 
pounds mass, his brown eyes a little 
too large, his thin lipped mouth 
a little too small, his teeth a little 
too long. 

The minute I saw him the old 
fear descended. It took him a few 
seconds to place where he had seen 
me before. Then he recognized me, 
and I could see memory flowing 
through his mind as his wide eyes 
widened even more, and his thin 
lips pulled back into a knowing 
grin. “Well, Cap’n Peabody!” he 
said, rolling the word Cap’n with 
his tongue as though flavoring it 
with contempt. “It’s a small world. 
Fancy ...” I could read his 
thoughts as they flashed across his 
face. He would play a waiting 
game, taking his time, but it would 
be a game to his liking. Showing up 
the yellow streak in a Captain. Sud- 
denly, he was completely respect- 
ful, almost too respectful. “It is cer- 
tainly good to be shipping with you, 
sir,” he said. 

“That’s the proper spirit, Res- 
nick,” I said. “All right, get aboard. 
Gate seven.” 

After he had gone I checked in 
the rest of the crew, seeing liking 
and respect in their eyes, and won- 
dering how quickly it would change 
to barely concealed contempt, won- 
dering what Resnick would do to 

64 



show me up. Like a renegade wolf 
he would bide his time, staying 
out of range, until the moment he 
decided was right, then he would 
dart in with a swift attack that 
would tear open my fear of him for 
all to see — and dart away again to 
sit and laugh while my soul withered 
within me. That’s all he would do. 
That’s all he would have to do, and 
he and I both knew it. 



I N THE DAYS following take-off, 
I watched the slow build-up with 
a certainty of knowledge that can 
only come from personal experi- 
ence. I knew Resnick’s methods. 

A successful bully must be a 
shrewd psychologist and know how 
to capitalize on weaknesses. I 
watched Oscar Resnick size up this 
man and that one, and go to work 
on each. It’s a subtle formula he 
used. Wait until you are alone with 
a man, then trip him when he goes 
by you, or dig your elbow into his 
ribs painfully, then claim it was an 
accident, but in such a way that 
both he and you know it wasn’t an 
accident yet nobody else will be- 
lieve it. Mock him with your eyes 
and your smile, dare him to do 
something about it. What can a 
man do? He can’t go running to 
the Mate with the complaint that 
you are picking on him. He can’t 
bring the thing into the open by 
fighting you without striking the 
first blow and being branded the 
aggressor in an unprovoked assault, 
and unless he is a professional 
fighter your sneering confidence 
bluffs him out of an open fight at 
first. Gradually you establish a fear 

ROG PHILLIPS 




reaction in him that would keep 
him from winning a fight even if, 
originally, he could have beaten 
you. 

When you are the victim of that 
sort of thing you really have only 
two courses of action open to you. 
Try to keep out of his way as much 
as possible, if you have any personal 
integrity, or kowtow to him, grovel 
in his presence, sneer with him at 
his other victims, flatter him, and 
hope he will direct his sadistic 
streak elsewhere. 

Soon four or five of the crewmen 
start hanging around with the bully, 
admiring him too much, laughing 
too much at what he says, siding 
with him against others, and even 
doing a little minor bullying them- 
selves by ganging up on this or that 
victim as soon as each has recog- 
nized the streak of cowardly sadism 
in the other which binds them to- 
gether as human jackals. 

A man like Resnick leaves the 
strong alone at first; waits until the 
jackals have gathered around him. 
When this stage is reached, when 
anybody who says anything is a 
yellow stool-pigeon, you find the 
best man in your crew a hospital 
case with bleeding nose, bruised 
face, black eyes, and maybe a cou- 
ple of broken ribs caved in by some- 
one’s shoe. After the doctor gives 
him first aid you go to the infirmary 
and ask him who did it. He clamps 
his lips together and tells you he 
didn’t see who it was. He’s lying, 
and he knows you know he is lying, 
but can you torture it out of him 
or punish him for not telling you? 
No. And there’s nothing a Captain 
can do about it. He must have the 



testimony of the injured party in' 
writing, signed and witnessed, and 
the Code Book must be followed 
specifically in punishing the aggres- 
sors; and if the Captain does any- 
thing at all he is almost certain to 
be tied up in court at the first port 
of call by the punished parties. Even 
if the Captain has provable justifi- 
cation for putting a man in the brig 
or fining him or giving him a demo- 
tion in assigned type of work, his 
ship will be delayed by the trial, 
and the owners will decide they 
need a Captain who knows how to 
avoid such costly delays. 

A man like Oscar Resnick is a 
social cancer, and I saw the symp- 
toms of his presence on the ship 
come into being, and grow, and I 
knew he was too cunning and too 
shrewd to let them get out of hand. 
Any other Captain, knowing all 
this, would sit back and do nothing, 
knowing that that was his only safe 
course consistent with his duty of 
keeping the ship on schedule. 

I had to follow this course of 
action too. But I knew that it was 
just a prelude, that when Resnick 
sensed the time was ripe for his 
purposes, he would get at me. 

It would be subtle and would 
only take a minute. It would take 
place in the presence of the crew. 
It would be something that would 
catch me unawares, bring the light 
of fear into my eyes for all the 
crew to see. That would be enough. 
The word would go back that 
Captain Peabody was yellow. 

Some of the crew would quit 
the ship at North Marsport, telling 
the Union business agent they didn’t 
want to ship with a yellow Captain.

CAPTAIN PEABODY 




The business agent would find men 
refusing to sign on my ship because 
I was a yellow Captain. And inevi- 
tably the time would come when I 
could not keep a full crew. Then 
the owners would dismiss me, and 
I wouldn’t be able to get another 
berth as Captain. 

I didn’t know how to avoid it. 
It was only a question of time. 
When would it happen? Today? 
Not for six months yet? Tomorrow? 
When? 

David Markham proved from the 
start to be an extremely conscien- 
tious orderly. My quarters were 
kept spotless, I had only to lift my 
eyebrows and he was there ready 
to obey. How many hours a day 
he spent wiping up imaginary dust, 
rubbing nonexistent detergent off 
my eating utensils for the nth time 
before I sat down to eat, polishing 
my already mirror-bright shoes, and 
the million and one things I didn’t 
even know about, I’ll never know. 

Few orderlies mix with the crew, 
and he was no exception. Most or- 
derlies either have the personality 
of a spinster to start with or acquire 
it after a few years. He had none of 
that, but then he wasn’t the type 
that orderlies are made of. 

There was a tension in him at 
all times that was so strong it 
seemed almost visible — a tension 
that made each minor chore a mat- 
ter of life and death to him. It was 
pitiful to watch, and I usually 
avoided watching him as much as 
possible. But a Captain may not 
pick up something he has dropped, 
or do a lot of things that any or- 
dinary man does for himself but 

66 



which are the traditional duties of 
the orderly — if for no other reason 
than to keep him busy; so by 
necessity David Markham was with 
me during most of my waking 
hours. 

A pattern of speculation about 
him grew up in one corner of my 
mind. David Markham was the 
type of man you instinctively like 
and respect, the type that in the 
service should have climbed the 
career ladder to an Admiralship by 
the time he was seventy-five. 

As the days passed the haunting 
fear in the depths of his eyes 
seemed almost to have vanished. 
If I had not known who he was I 
would have laughed at the possi- 
bility of his being a coward. Even 
knowing who he was, I began to 
doubt it. 

I thought a great deal about the 
circumstances brought out at his 
court-martial, the testimony that 
proved he had broken cover and 
run, then groveled at the feet of 
his captors, crying and pleading for 
his life. Later the enemy had cap- 
tured outposts they could not have 
located without his help, proving 
that he had spilled his guts to save 
his skin. That had, of course, been 
in the fuss on Venus with Porter’s 
Renegades. I didn’t see how there 
could be any doubt of David Mark- 
ham’s guilt, even though the more 
I saw of the man the more un- 
believable it seemed. I tried to 
figure out alternative explanations. 
I tried to believe them. I wanted 
to believe. 

I would catch Markham gazing 
through a viewport into the sub- 
dued silver velvet of infinity and at 

ROG PHILLIPS 




the millions of flashing jewels that 
are the individually visible suns of 
our galaxy and the nebulae that 
are other galaxies, with his tortured 
soul, for the moment, at peace. I 
would hesitate, wanting to join him 
in his quiet mood as I would have 
joined any other man, then I would 
steal away* unable somehow to 
bring myself to create any kind of 
bond between us. I had, I realized 
by then, chosen David Markham 
in the hopes that he might become 
a tidbit I could toss to Resnick to 
pacify him and divert him from 
me. A cowardly motivation, no 
matter how you look at it. It had 
been an impulse I was now ashamed 
of. It haunted me. Because of it I 
couldn’t bring myself to extend to 
him a Judas friendship, which is 
what I felt it would be. 

We were forty days out from 
Earth when Resnick turned his at- 
tention to David Markham. I dis- 
covered it quite by accident. Ten 
minutes after my regular sleep pe- 
riod had begun the First Mate saw 
fit to inform me that an uncharted 
meteor swarm was going to inter- 
cept us in four hours, and of course 
it was my responsibility to deter- 
mine what precautions should be 
taken. 

Under ordinary circumstances I 
would merely have rung for my 
orderly, but I was half asleep and 
did the more natural thing. I went 
to the door to his room, next to 
mine, and opened it without knock- 
ing. He had just undressed, getting 
ready for bed. He stood there, 
startled at my unexpected entrance. 
And I saw the ugly purple splotch 
over his kidneys that could have 

CAPTAIN PEABODY 



come only from the blow of a fist. 

I pretended I hadn’t noticed it. 
I merely told him that there would 
be emergency duty, and backed 
out, sliding the door shut. 

When he came out two minutes 
later, he gave no indication of 
whether he thought I had noticed 
the bruise or not. And for the next 
few hours I was far too busy to con- 
cern myself about it anyway. But I 
felt as though I had given him that 
bruise myself, with my own fist, and 
I was as surely responsible for it as 
though I had. 

To make it worse, I realized that 
despite the guilt I felt I still hoped 
that Resnick would settle for a 
famous coward, and leave me alone. 

While I plotted the courses of 
hundreds of chunks of meteor iron 
to search out safe holes through the 
intercepting meteor group my 
thoughts whispered gleefully, “All 
you have to do is pretend you 
don’t know anything and maybe 
Resnick will be grateful and leave 
you alone.” 

Later, trying to get some sleep, I 
tried to think what could be done. 
Could I come right out and ask 
Markham about that bruise? Sup- 
pose I did, and he told me Resnick 
had done it, and I used that as an 
excuse to toss Resnick in the brig? 
Then the men would throw Mark- 
ham’s reputation in my face and 
claim it was a cowardly lie; and if 
I didn’t release Resnick it would 
mean an official investigation at 
North Marsport — on the first leg of 
my first command. Suppose he told 
me and I did nothing. Then he 
would know I was afraid of Res- 
nick! 

67 




I didn’t sleep much. I didn’t get 
much sleep for several days. 
Coupled with my guilt feeling, my 
hate for myself, was a growing 
feeling that striking my orderly was 
the first step in Resnick’s plan to 
get at me, smoke me into the open 
where he could find an opportunity 
to expose me. 

It was obvious how Resnick had 
gotten to Markham. It had to be 
when Markham went to the kitchen 
to bring my meals, and it had to be 
with the knowledge of the cook, 
which meant that Resnick already 
ruled the crew openly, behind the 
scenes. 

There was no danger of mutiny 
or any of the claptrap of fiction, of 
course. Resnick was no fool, and 
had no insane ambitions other than 
that of feeding his streak of sadism. 

A few days later I noticed a 
small spot of blood on the back 
of Markham’s shirt. I said nothing, 
but that evening after I had dis- 
missed him and he had gone to his 
room I took a small flat metal mir- 
ror and slid it under his door just 
far enough to peek in and watch 
him undress, and I saw the welts 
across his back. 

Worse, I saw him crying. He 
shook with silent sobs while tears 
streamed from his eyes, and hope- 
lessness and discouragement and 
friendlessness held possession of him. 

At that moment I knew with 
absolute conviction that the court- 
martial had been right. He was a 
coward and would never be any- 
thing else. But at the same moment, 
I suddenly understood him. It was 
something he couldn’t help. 

I lay in the darkness of my own 

68 



cubicle, a dull anger growing with- 
in me, turning me into a slightly 
irrational being. 

There was, I suppose, a sort of 
self-flagellation to it. A psychiatrist 
would possibly diagnose it as that, 
anyway. In my own mind I was 
responsible for everything Resnick 
did to David Markham, which 
meant that by “punishing” Resnick 
I was punishing myself. When you 
descend to such levels of pure and 
obsessing emotional thinking, logic 
gets mixed up quite a bit. 

I came out of that sleepless sleep 
period with one thing quite clear in 
my thoughts. Things couldn't go on 
the way they were. 

Oh, sure, I had a sneaking hunch 
that this frame of mind I was in 
was what Resnick had been angling 
for. By now I had invested Resnick 
with omniscience so that it seemed 
perfectly logical that he should 
know I had spent a sleepless night, 
that he should know I had seen 
those welts on Markham’s back. In 
my mind’s eye I could see him, a 
sneer on his thin lipped small 
mouth, while he waited for me to 
stick my neck out. I could see his 
muscular arms, covered by freckled 
skin that covered sleek muscles, 
dangling at his sides, fingers un- 
coiled but ready to double into fists 
— fists that had once beaten me 
into shuddering unconsciousness, 
years ago — fists that could do it 
again while slightly mad brown eyes 
glittered at me, mocking . 

David Markham served my 
breakfast, the perfect orderly, quick 
to anticipate my wishes, so attuned 
to my habits by now that he almost 
seemed to read my thoughts before 

ROG PHILLIPS 




I was aware of them myself. He 
seemed to have not a care in the 
world. A cold shower can cover a 
multitude of inner tortures with a 
pink glow of well being . 

Suddenly the idea came to me. I 
would talk to Oscar Resnick. I 
would plead with him. I would of- 
fer him money — my whole salary 
on this trip. Such men have their 
price. As Captain I made five times 
more than he. I would give it all 
to him if he would agree to lay off. 

All I wanted was to get through 
my first command without trouble, 
get back to Earth on schedule, make 
a good showing. I was, suddenly, 
pathetically confident that he would 
agree. A deal like that would have 
to be discussed in absolute privacy, 
however. The slightest inkling of it 
to the crew — 

In a panic of haste lest my confi- 
dence wane, I skipped my third cup 
of coffee and hurried to my office. 
Switching the intercom to crews’ 
quarters\I said with the crisp tones 
of command, “Mr. Resnick, report 
to the Captain’s office,” repeating 
it three times as is customary on 
intercom calls aboard ship. Then I 
made sure the intercom was off, and 
sat there behind my desk waiting, 
my heart pounding painfully within 
my chest, my fingers clenched into 
white knuckled fists to keep them 
from trembling. 

Five minutes later there came a 
polite knock at the door. Composing 
myself as much as possible I said, 
“Come in,” in what I hoped was a 
calm authoritative voice. 

The door slid open and Oscar 
Resnick stood there, his shoulders 
almost as wide as the door opening, 



his space-faded sandy hair neatly 
combed back, his brown eyes dart- 
ing around the room in a quick 
survey and just as quickly masking 
their triumphant glitter as he saw 
that I was alone, his thin lips which 
had been in a firm straight line 
breaking into a satisfied and antici- 
patory smile. 

“Come in and close the door,” I 
commanded, my voice breaking into 
nervous uncertainty on the last 
three words. 

He stepped inside and closed the 
door firmly behind him, his eyes 
never leaving me. When the door 
was firmly closed he said, “Sure, 
Art, old boy.” With those four 
words he took command of the 
situation. They had been uttered 
so softly that they could not have 
sent a whisper over the intercom 
even if it had been on. He walked 
toward me until he came to the 
edge of the desk, then planting his 
fists on the desk top, he said, “I’ve 
been wondering how long it would 
take for you to call me in for a 
little talk.” He exuded an aura of 
quiet contemptuous strength as his 
eyes flicked over me in speculation. 

“That’s right,” I said, hearing 
the nervous squeak in my voice, not 
sure whether my comment had any 
relation to what he had said or not. 
“I want to have a talk with you. 
Things can’t go on the way they 
are!” 

Resnick drew back in pretended 
surprise. “Why, I don’t know what 
you mean, sir he said. 

“You know perfectly well what I 
mean,” I said, my voice breaking 
completely. “This is my first com- 
mand! My whole future hangs on 

69 



CAPTAIN PEABODY 




it. What satisfaction could you pos- 
sibly get from ruining me?” 

In that moment the past de- 
scended upon me completely. Once 
again I was pleading for mercy 
where there was no mercy, hoping 
against hope before those soft mad 
eyes, searching for something that 
could never be there. 

“Why, sir / 9 he said, mockingly, 
“I don’t know what you mean at 
all. Perhaps the stress of your new 
duties . .?” 

“How much would you take?” I 
blurted desperately. “How much, to 
lay off of — David Markham — leave 
me alone . .?” 

“Birds of a feather, huh?” he 
said. His eyes became thoughtful. 
“Every man has his price, I sup- 
pose . .” 

A surge of hope coursed through 
me. Maybe we could dicker. Maybe 
it wouldn’t cost as much as I was 
prepared to pay. 

He scratched his chin slowly, then 
said, “Well — how about your salary 
for this trip and five thousand dol- 
lars?” His thin lips flicked back 
in a grin. “And a promise on your 
part that you will sign me on for 
the next trip — or turn in your 
Captain’s papers?” 

The universe stood still as I saw 
ruin facing me. There was no way 
out. No way out at all. I heard my- 
self blurt, “Why? Why? WHY?” 
He leaned over my desk slowly, 
his fists planted on it once again, 
until his face was scant inches from 
mine. He whispered, “Because 
you’re yellow. That’s why. You 
never had any business becoming 
a captain.” His hoarse, taunting 
whisper hung in the silence of the 

70 



room like the knell of doom. 

There is a madness beyond mad- 
ness, of that I am sure. I should 
have been grovelling in fear, I 
should have been making a decision 
to step into an airlock and eject 
myself into space, a suicide unable 
to live longer with himself, because 
what he said was true and I knew 
it was true beyond any shadow of 
doubt. 

Instead, I heard myself saying, 
“All right, Resnick. You win.” My 
voice was perfectly calm. It was not 
me. Whatever it was, it was not me, 
talking. My part of my mind was in 
a numb stupor, unable to act, un- 
able even to think. I heard my voice 
say, “It’s a deal. You promise to lay 
off. In return I promise to turn 
my salary for this trip over to you 
when we get paid, and to sign you 
on for the next trip.” My voice was 
perfectly calm, even practical. I 
felt my lips curve into a calculated 
and bitter smile of defeat. I heard 
myself say, “Such an agreement 
can’t be put into writing, of course, 
but — shall we drink on it?” 

I saw disappointment, disbelief, 
amazed surprise, cross his lean ang- 
ular features as I rose from behind 
my desk. As though in a dream I 
turned my back on him as I crossed 
the office to the liquor cabinet, the 
prerogative of a space Captain. I 
opened it up with unshaking hands. 
He followed me, came to stand be- 
hind me, very close. I lifted out a 
bottle of Scotch, the seal still un- 
broken, and turned to him. 

“Scotch?” I asked. 

He hulked over me, his thin lips 
stretched into a gleeful grin. “Sure,” 
he said softly, his lips pasted against 



ROG PHILLIPS 




his stained teeth. 

He sensed my sudden movement, 
a movement I was not conscious of 
dictating, but he was too slow as 
the full bottle crashed down on his 
skull, shattering and sending a 
shower of alcohol over his uniform 
and the floor. His eyes did not 
close, but blanked into unconscious- 
ness as he sagged to the floor. 

I stood there for a moment, 
blinking down at his unconscious 
form, not quite believing what had 
happened. Even in unconsciousness 
he sent fear icing through my veins. 

In one mad moment I had 
ruined it all. When he recovered 
he would be unforgiving, without 
mercy. For a minute or two I broke 
down completely, crying like a 
baby. 

Then, gradually, a calm settled 
over me. I turned him over onto his 
back and pulled his slack arms to- 
gether. I took off my belt and 
wrapped it around his wrists until 
I could fasten the buckle firmly. 

Then I went to my cubicle and 
brought bsck a roll of adhesive tape 
and taped his lips closed, laughing 
in a low, mad voice that was not 
my own. 

I used the rest of the roll of tape 
to fasten his ankles together. And 
just as I finished he opened his 
eyes. 

It took him a few minutes to or- 
ganize his thoughts and fix his at- 
tention on me, his eyes questioning 
me. I continued to chuckle under 
my breath. I was mad, conscious of 
the fact that I was mad, and beyond 
caring. 

“You have nice eyes,” I heard 
myself say. “Nice soft brown eyes.” 

CAPTAIN PEABODY 



I examined his scalp with careful 
concern for a moment. “Good 
thing,” I said. “The bottle broke, 
so there will be no sign of abrasion 
that could be proof of anything.” 

I took out a cigarette and lit it 
with trembling fingers, while he 
watched me. Blowing out a stream- 
er of smoke and jabbing in his 
direction with my fingers, I said, 
“I’m learning a few things, Res- 
nick. Already — I’m learning. I 
wonder how much it will take to 
break you down.” 

I pushed his head back and tried 
to put my thumb against his eye- 
ball. He closed his eyes tightly and 
I forced his right eye open and 
pressed the ball of my thumb 
against the exposed eyeball. 

“Not too much or it will make 
your eye bloodshot,” I said, in 
hardly more than a whisper. “Evi- 
dence, you know. Who’s going to 
believe that the Captain did such 
a thing? Not even the crew! Sure, 
they’ll agree with you to keep from 
being beat up. That is, if you have 
any stomach for that sort of thing 
when I get through with you. I’m 
just beginning, you know.” 

I lifted my thumb from his eye 
and squeezed his nostrils together, 
watching the terror build up in 
him, watching his struggles, watch- 
ing him grow weaker and weaker, 
and releasing him at the last mo- 
ment before he lost consciousness, 
and watching his chest heave as he 
sucked in lungsful of air. 

“I just thought of something,” I 
said to him. “You wouldn’t dare 
retaliate after I let you go. To 
strike me would be treason, punish- 
able by life imprisonment, wouldn’t

it? And what would be your de- 
fense? That the Captain had tor- 
tured you? Who would believe 
that? Who are your witnesses? See 
how I have stolen your weapons?” 
I pried his left eye open and 
pressed against it with a thumbnail. 
“A half hour ought to do it,” I 
taunted. “No marks. I have to be 
very careful so that an examination 
by the ship’s doctor won’t show 
a thing.” 

In ten minutes — or was it ten 
eternities? — he became a quivering 
mass of flesh. 

I did things to him that left him 
too weak to move. At the end of 
half an hour I pulled the tape 
off his mouth and listened to him 
blubber. I took the tape off his 
ankles, and the belt off his wrists. 
I tortured him some more and he 
took it. 

“And when I call for you over 
the intercom,” I said, “if you don’t 
come at once I have you for gross 
insubordination to your Captain. 
And if you so much as touch one 
member of the crew again I’ll call 
you, boy. I’ll call you.” 

Finally I let him go. 

A FTER HE HAD gone I trem- 
. bled like a leaf. Slowly a little 
bit of sanity returned to me, and 
with it a realization of what I had 
done. Nausea overcame me and I 
staggered into the washroom and 
got rid of my breakfast, then re- 
turned to my desk. 

For hours I sat there while my 
mind picked up the threads of life 
and began functioning again. There 
was still the feeling that Resnick 



was omniscient, that he would be 
able to topple me into disgrace. But 
with it, gradually, came the realiza- 
tion that he wouldn’t, that he 
couldn’t. 

I had used his own psychological 
weapons on him, building up in him 
a fear psychosis that he couldn’t 
successfully fight. I had turned the 
tables. 

I couldn’t really believe it just 
yet, but I couldn’t disbelieve it 
either. For the next three days I 
went about my customary routines 
with a calm exterior, waiting for 
the storm to break, but it never did. 

Finally, to test it, I deliberately 
went on a tour of inspection 
through the ship, until I came to 
where Resnick was working, along 
with several others of the crew. As 
I entered the compartment and saw 
him look up, I saw the instinctive 
cringing that he couldn’t help. In 
a flash of inspiration I saw that his 
sadism was a cover for his own 
cowardice, a compensation mech- 
anism. 

I knew then that I had won. 
After one long silent moment I 
turned my back on him and left 
the compartment. 

As I walked by myself to the 
central tube and pulled myself up 
to the Captain’s deck, for the first 
time I began to realize what being 
Captain meant. It means a lot of 
things, of course, but most of all it 
means facing up to one’s command, 
being in charge. 

I knew that I would never again 
be afraid — least of all afraid of 
Oscar Resnick. Nor would I ever 
again be afraid of fear. In the fu- 
ture I might be faced with the

EDDI 




Philip Duncan , the St. Louis at- 
torney and former FBI agent , who 
wrote the definitive “History of 
Espionage ”, observes that in all the 
records dealing with spies and 
counterspies there is no more signifi- 
cant case than that of Dr. John 
O’Hara Smith, an electronics re- 
search engineer. Duncan maintains 
that Dr. Smith, whose rather quix- 
otic name is real and not assumed, 
contributed more to the advance- 
ment of espionage and counter- 
espionage methods than any one 
person in history. 

For a period of more than a year, 
the case of Dr. John O’Hara Smith 
was known to only a few security 
and defense officials. The first pub- 
lic reference to it came on Novem- 
ber 22, 1956, when an assistant to 
Secretary of Defense Wilson ob- 
liquely commented on it in testi- 
mony before the House Military 
Affairs Committee. Subsequently, 
more details were leaked to several 
Washington correspondents, and 
then vigorously denied. A brief ac- 
count of the matter appeared on an 
inside page of the New York Times, 
but aroused no general interest. 

As a matter of fact, so little is 
known about the entire case that 
several of the people who were in 
on its early phases are still not sure 
whether Dr. John O’Hara Smith 
is alive or dead, or whether he was 
a spy or counterspy. 




However , on the basis of in- 
formation now declassified , plus 
two highly technical papers pre- 
sented to the Institute of Research 
Engineers, anyone sufficiently in- 
terested can reconstruct most of the 
case. 

I T BEGAN AT approximately 
7:15 P.M., August 11, 1955, 
when Dr. John O’Hara Smith re- 
turned with a bag of groceries to 
his house trailer in the Mira Mar 
Trailer Park, overlooking a long 
blue reach of the Pacific Ocean, 
some twelve miles south of Los 
Angeles. He put the groceries on the 
drainboard beside his spotless two- 
bumer butane stove, carefully 
flicked away a speck of dust and 
then stepped eagerly toward the 
rear of his trailer, where an intricate 
assembly of tubes and wires occu- 
pied what normally would have 
been the dining area. 

Dr. Smith flipped on a switch, 
and then received what he later 
called, in his precise, pedantic way, 
a split-second premonition of dan- 
ger. 

The Go-NoGo panel light flashed 
and went out; the transistor looked 
grey instead of red ; the wires to the 
binary-coded digitizer were crossed ; 
the extra module in the basic as- 
sembly had not been there that 
morning . 

Dr. Smith methodically cata- 
logued these details, and he stepped 
backward, just a breath of a mo- 
ment before the low hum sharpened 
to a whine. He tripped, and in fall- 
ing his left shoulder knocked open 
the door to the small toilet closet. 
Instinctively, he writhed the upper 

76 



part of his body through the narrow 
doorway. His thick-lensed glasses 
fell underneath him, leaving him 
practically blind. 

His elbows and knees were still 
making frenzied, primordial crawl- 
ing movements when the detonation 
brought a wave of oblivion that al- 
most, but not quite, preceded the 
pain. 

A squad car from the Los An- 
geles County Sheriff’s Department 
turned in the first report: 

John O'Hara Smith, male, white, 
about 45; critically injured by ex- 
plosion in house trailer; removed 
by ambulance to General Hospital; 
explosion occurred at . 

Two days later, the Sheriff’s De- 
partment apparently closed the case 
with a one-line addition to its 
original report: 

Explosion believed to have been 
caused by leaking butane connec- 
tion. 

But, in the interval, other agen- 
cies had entered the case. 

The first was the Industrial Se- 
curity Office attached to the 
Western Division of the Air Force’s 
Research and Development Com- 
mand in the once suburban com- 
munity of Inglewood, California. 

When Chief Security Officer 
Amos Busch received a call at 
11:32 the morning after the explo- 
sion, he automatically noted the 
time on his desk pad. The call was 
from Pacific Electronics, Inc., a 
subcontracting firm in nearby El 
Segundo. 

The president and owner of 
Pacific Electronics was on the 
phone. In a tone that betrayed con- 

FRANK RILEY 




siderable agitation, he identified 
himself as Wesley Browne. 

“One of my research engineers — 
my best engineer, dammit — was 
nearly killed last night in an ex- 
plosion . maybe he’s dead now,” 
reported Browne, his words breath- 
lessly treading on each other. 
“There’s something damn funny 
about this . .” 

Amos Busch wrote : Research en- 
gineer . explosion . nearly 
killed. Then he asked judicially: 

“What do you mean by ‘damn 
funny’, Mr. Browne?” 

“This engineer was working on 
our vernier actuating cylinder for 
the Atlas guided missile ... Just two 
days ago, he — he said he wanted 
me to know where his files were . 
in case anything happened to 
him . .” 

Amos Busch was a jowly, greying 
man who gave the appearance of 
being slow moving. But before the 
president of Pacific Electronics, 
Inc., hung up, Busch had already 
used another phone and the inter- 
com to put in motion a chain reac- 
tion that would deliver to his desk 
the security report on Dr. John 
O’Hara Smith. 

There was nothing out of order 
in the report. There couldn’t have 
been, or Dr. Smith wouldn’t have 
been cleared for the ballistic missile 
program. According to the report, 
he had lived aloofly for all of his 
adult years. Even as a boy, his sole 
interest had been to tinker with 
mechanical projects. His grades and 
IQ were high above the norm, and 
his attitude towards his classmates 
varied between impatience and out- 
right sarcasm. “I always thought 



John was a lonely boy,” a former 
teacher had recalled to an FBI 
officer during the security check. 
“He never had anything in common 
with other youngsters.” After ob- 
taining his Ph.D. in electrical en- 
gineering from the University of 
Wisconsin, he had worked for Allis- 
Chalmers Research Division in Mil- 
waukee and lived with his mother 
until her death in 1951, when he 
bought a house trailer and moved 
to the coast. He had no close 
friends, no record of even a remote 
connection with any communist or 
communist-front group. 

Security Officer Busch decided to 
visit the trailer, or what remained 
of it. He was not an electronics 
man, or even a normally incom- 
petent do-it-yourself mechanic, but 
when he saw the shattered tangle of 
wires and tubes, along with the 
obvious remnant of a short-wave re- 
ceiver, Amos Busch promptly called 
Major General David Sanders, 
commander of the USAF’s Western 
Development Division. 

General Sanders scratched his 
tanned bald head, and said, 

“We’d better get the FBI in on 
this, Amos.” 

The FBI went to work with a 
thoroughness that made John 
O’Hara Smith’s previous security 
investigation look like the processing 
of an application to join the 
Kiwanis. While agents sifted every 
detail of his life since the day of 
his birth, he was moved to a private 
room at General Hospital and three 
nurses cleared for security were as- 
signed to care for him. 

For eight days, Smith was in a 
coma. On the morning of the ninth 



EDDIE 



77 




day, he groaned, turned to one side 
and rolled back again. The nurse on 
duty put down her magazine and 
moved quickly to his bedside. She 
moistened a cloth and wiped the 
perspiration from his high forehead, 
brushing back the thinning tangle 
of fine, brown hair. 

His eyes blinked open, stared at 
her. He whispered: 

“Eddie . what happened . 
to Eddie?” 

Remembering her instructions 
from the FBI, the nurse turned to 
make certain the door was closed. 

“Was Eddie in the trailer with 
you?” she asked, bending closer to 
catch his reply. 

He gave her a look of utter dis- 
gust, and tried to moisten his 
cracked lips with the tip of his 
tongue. But he drifted off again 
without replying. 

This incident was duly recorded 
in the FBI’s growing dossier, along 
with another conversation that took 
place in the office of Wesley Browne 
at Pacific Electronics, Inc. After 
carefully reviewing John O’Hara 
Smith’s work record, FBI agent 
Frank Cowles inquired: 

“Is there anything — anything at 
all, Mr. Browne — that you would 
consider out of the ordinary about 
Smith’s recent actions?” 

There was a trace of uneasiness 
in Browne’s manner, but he tried to 
cover it by looking annoyed. 

“I don’t know why in the devil 
you fellows are spending so much 
time on Smith! . He sure as hell 
didn’t blow himself up!” 

“Of course not,” Cowles said, 
placatingly. “But we never know 
where a lead will come from . .” 

78 



He repeated the question. 
Browne hesitated. 

“I suppose,” he began, shifting 
his big bulk uncomfortably, “this 
will sound kind of odd . but you 
know we’ve got the subcontract to 
produce this actuating cylinder for 
the Atlas . .” 

The agent nodded. 

“Well, six months before we 
were asked to submit specs and bids 
on such a cylinder, Smith came to 
me and said he had an idea for 
something the Air Force might 
soon be needing . .” 

Agent Cowles maintained his air 
of polite attention, but his cool grey 
eyes narrowed. Browne shifted 
again, and continued: 

“I told him to go ahead — you 
never can tell what these research 
guys will come up with . .” 

“And what did he come up with, 
Mr. Browne?” 

“You won’t believe this, maybe 
— but he came up with the design 
for the complete vernier hydraulic 
actuating cylinder — including the 
drive sector gear — at least three 
months before we had the faintest 
idea such an item would even be 
needed!” 

The FBI man’s ball-point pen 
moved swiftly. 

“Anything else?” 

Browne instinctively lowered his 
voice : 

“Smith even suggested that the 
cylinder would help to offset the 
roll and yaw in an intercontinental 
ballistic missile!” 

A brittle edge came into the 
agent’s courteous tone: 

“Did you report this to security?” 
In spite of the airconditioning 

FRANK RILEY 




unit in the window, the president 
and owner of Pacific Electronics, 
Inc., seemed to feel that the room 
was getting very warm. He ran a fat 
forefinger under his white collar. 

“No,” he admitted. “We got the 
contract, of course — it was a cinch! 
— and I just wrote it off as a lucky 
break . You can see how Fd 
feel, can’t you?” 

“Yes,” said Cowles, “I can.” 

Bit by bit, a new picture of the 
meticulous, professorial Dr. Smith 
began to emerge from the FBI dos- 
sier. 

During the working week, his 
habit had been to keep his trailer 
in a small park just off Sepulveda 
Blvd., a half-mile from the Pacific 
Electronics plant. After work on 
Fridays, he invariably left for the 
weekend, usually for any one of a 
dozen scenic trailer parks along the 
coast between San Diego and Santa 
Barbara. He always went alone. No 
one had ever seen or met “Eddie”. 
Outside of working hours, Smith’s 
only association with his profession- 
al colleagues was through the Insti- 
tute of Research Engineers. He at- 
tended monthly meetings, and occa- 
sionally wrote dry, abstract articles 
on theoretical research for the In- 
stitute’s quarterly journal. 

Under microscopic study and 
chemical analysis, investigators de- 
termined that nitro-glycerine had 
caused the explosion. The fused 
mass of electronics wreckage in 
Smith’s trailer were identified as 
parts of a computer assembly. 
Thousands of dollars had been 
spent on components over the 
past three years. Purchases, usually 
for cash, were traced to various 



electronic supply companies in 
the greater Los Angeles area. 

Dr. Smith’s bank account showed 
a balance of only $263.15. But the 
big find came from a safety deposit 
box in the same branch bank. 
There, along with a birth certifi- 
cate, his mother’s marriage license, 
an insurance policy, his doctor’s de- 
gree from the University of Wis- 
consin and an unused passport, was 
a duplicate set of computer memory 
tapes. 

It took the FBI forty-eight hours 
to play a few selected segments from 
these tapes, which obviously had 
been recorded over a period of sev- 
eral years. 

Two notations made by Agent 
Cowles indicate the type of material 
contained on the tapes: 

“If a deliberate attempt were 
m^de to run a thermonuclear test 
explosion within the frontiers of 
Russia, in such a way as to avoid 
detection, it would almost certainly 
be successful . .” 

“The Soviet Union may soon de- 
velop a new ratio of fusion to fission 
energy in high yield weapons and 
will require additional data . .” 
FBI agents listening to these play- 
backs were convinced, almost to a 
man, that they had stumbled across 
the hottest espionage trail since the 
arrest of Klaus Fuchs and the case 
of the Rosenbergs. 

A round-the-clock security guard 
was placed outside the hospital 
room of John O’Hara Smith, while 
Federal authorities waited impa- 
tiently to see whether he would live 
or die. Smith would answer, or leave 
unanswered, a lot of vital questions. 



EDDIE 



79 




S ECURITY NOTWITH- 
standing, it was the day after 
Labor Day before the medical staff 
of General Hospital would permit 
the first direct questioning of Dr. 
Smith. And then the interrogators 
were instructed: 

“Only a few minutes.” 

Three men filed quietly into 
Smith’s room as soon as the nurse 
removed his luncheon tray. They 
stood in a semi-circle around the 
foot of his bed. 

Agent Frank Cowles opened a 
black leather folder the size of a 
small billfold and presented his cre- 
dentials. He introduced General 
Sanders and Security Officer Busch. 
It was the first time any of the men 
had seen John O’Hara Smith. The 
reports had called him pudgy, but 
now he had lost twenty pounds and 
his cheek bones were gaunt under 
his pallid skin. He wore unusually 
thick, dark-rimmed glasses that 
magnified his eyes and gave him an 
owlish appearance. He returned 
their scrutiny with a mixture of 
assurance and impatience, like a 
professor waiting for his class to 
come to order. 

“Good morning, gentlemen,” he 
said tartly. “It’s about time some- 
one came to see me about this . 

Cowles cleared his throat and 
suggested cautiously: 

“Then you’re willing to give us 
a statement, Dr. Smith?” 

“Don’t talk drivel, man! How are 
you going to know anything about 
it if I don’t make a statement!” 
Though still weak, Dr. Smith’s 
voice had a high, imperious quality. 
Clearly, he did not wish to waste 

80 



time or strength on mere conver- 
sation. 

The three men exchanged glanc- 
es. Cowles and Amos Busch took 
out notebooks. 

“Now, Dr. Smith,” Cowles be- 
gan, “what is your view as to the 
nature of the explosion in your 
trailer and the reason for it?” 

“I’m an electronics research en- 
gineer, not an expert in explosives,” 
Smith retorted with some asperity. 
“But as to the reason, I’m sure 
they wanted to destroy Eddie and 
me!” 

He glared, as if daring anybody 
to challenge this statement. 

“Eddie?” ventured Cowles. 

“I try to speak plainly, Mr. 
Cowles ... I said ‘Eddie and me’!” 

General David Sanders rested 
two large hands on the foot of the 
white iron bedstead and squeezed 
until his knuckles bulged ominously. 
A volatile man, he had trouble with 
his own temper even without being 
provoked. But his voice was decep- 
tively calm: 

“Dr. Smith, do I gather that 
someone else was in the trailer with 
you at the time of the explosion?” 

Smith grimaced expressively, and 
answered as if speaking to an eight- 
year-old: 

“No, General Sanders ... I was 
quite alone.” 

After thirty years in the Air 
Force, Amos Busch was not used 
to hearing a Major General spoken 
to in this way. It violated his sense 
of propriety. 

“Dr. Smith,” he exploded, “just 
who or what in the hell is or was 
Eddie?” 

With what was remarkably close 
FRANK RILEY 




to an air of incredulity, Smith 
looked slowly from one to the 
other. 

“I gather you gentlemen haven’t 
read my latest article.” 

“Not thoroughly,” Cowles ad- 
mitted. 

“Then you don’t know of my re- 
search work with an educatable 
computer,” Smith said accusingly. 
Seeing that they didn’t, he added: 
“I have named it ‘Eddie’!” 

“What . what is an educatable 
computer?” ventured Cowles. 

It was clear that Dr. Smith wel- 
comed this question. His eyes 
glowed behind their thick lenses, 
and his high voice dropped its 
edge of sharpness. 

“Eddie is a computer with a 
capacity to learn,” he replied 
proudly. “It learns from assimila- 
tion of information and deductive 
reasoning — at a rate at least 10,000 
times that of the human mind! 
That’s why Eddie comes up with 
so many answers! . The only 
problem is, we seldom know what 
questions the answers answer.” 

His three interrogators had the 
look of men leaning into a heavy 
wind. General Sanders recovered 
first, and demanded: 

“What the devil was it made 
for then?” 

“Eddie was not designed for any 
specific task — that’s why Eddie is 
so valuable . and dangerous!” 
Dr. Smith rolled out this last 
word as if he relished it. 

“Do you realize,” he went on, 
with careful emphasis, “that Eddie 
has solved problems we won’t even 
know exist for another thousand 
years!” 



This pronouncement was greeted 
by a moment of strained silence. 
General Sanders finally said, 
“H-m-m-m.” 

He looked at Busch, who looked 
at Cowles, who asked: 

“Does Eddie solve any problems 
closer to our own time, Dr. Smith?” 
“Of course . .” 

“Did Eddie come up with the 
idea for that Atlas stabilizing cyl- 
inder?” 

“Certainly.” 

General Sanders moved a step 
closer to the bed. 

“Any other ideas like that?” he 
inquired eagerly. 

Dr. Smith’s smile was neither 
wholly supercilious nor merely self- 
assured. It was a little of both, 
plus a lot of pure satisfaction at 
being stage center with his favorite 
subject. He cocked his head back 
and stared down his stump of a 
nose. 

“You’re working on a missile de- 
fense system for bombers, aren’t 
you?” he challenged General 
Sanders. 

“What about it?” hedged the 
General. 

“Have you learned how to design 
a finned missile which can be 
launched across the bomber’s air- 
stream without being thrown off 
course?” 

General Sanders ignored a warn- 
ing glance from Amos Busch. 

“Do you . does this Eddie 
know how to do it?” 

“Eddie says it doesn’t matter!” 
“What?” 

“Eddie says what difference does 
it make if the missile is thrown off 
course by the airstream — as long 

81 



EDDIE 




as you can reorient it into a com- 
pensated trajectory. We were work- 
ing on a new gyroscope principle 
that might do the trick . 

FBI Agent Cowles was always 
the personification of courtesy, but 
he could assert himself when neces- 
sary. He did so now. 

“Excuse me, General,” he inter- 
rupted, “but first there are some 
other matters we must go into with 
Dr. Smith.” 

The General nodded reluctantly. 
He took out an envelope and made 
some notes of his own on the back 
of it. 

“Now, Dr. Smith,” said Cowles, 
“let’s get back to the explosion . 
Why do you feel someone wanted 
to destroy you and Eddie?” 

“I believe they had copied Ed- 
die’s circuit design and wanted to 
make sure another one wasn’t built 
* — at least in the immediate future.” 

“Why not?” 

Dr. John O’Hara Smith showed 
a neat flair for timing as he waited 
just long enough to build suspense, 
before answering: 

“Because Eddie knew that our 
security system for safeguarding the 
missile program is about as up to 
date as the horse and buggy!” 

His words couldn’t have been 
better chosen to startle his audi- 
ence. Amos Busch took them as a 
personal affront. 

“Horse and buggy!” he snorted. 
“You’d better spell that out, Dr. 
Smith!” 

Smith’s reply was prompt and 
precise : 

“Eddie has concluded that hu- 
man methods and minds alone are 
not enough to cope with security 

82 



issues in an area where even the 
simplest technical problems must 
be handled by intricate computing 
devices . 

His owlish eyes moved from one 
man to another, trying to judge 
whether they were following him. 

“You see, Gentlemen,” he went 
on, “the technology we are dealing 
with is so unbelievably complex 
that the possibilities for espionage 
are multiplied infinitely beyond the 
capacity of a human intellect to 
grasp and evaluate . 

“For example,” demanded Gen- 
eral Sanders. 

“For example,” Smith retorted 
with equal sharpness, “what good 
does it do to surround ballistic 
missile plants with security regula- 
tions if the missile itself can be 
stolen right out of the air?” 

“Fantastic!” said General San- 
ders. 

“Nuts,” said Amos Busch. 

Agent Cowles said nothing. 

John O’Hara Smith sank back 
against his pillow, panting a little. 
His high forehead glistened with 
sweat. When he gathered the 
strength to speak again, he directed 
his words to General Sanders: 

“General, these ICBM missiles 
being fired into the Atlantic Ocean 
from the coast of Florida . Are 
you sure you know what’s hap- 
pened to all of them?” 

“I think so,” the General an- 
swered calmly. 

“And what about your own X-15 
project, General?” 

The question was almost a taunt. 

General David William Sanders 
had jumped with his paratroopers 
into France on a morning in June, 

FRANK RILEY 




1944. He had risen in rank through 
the test of battle and the more ex- 
cruciating ordeal of the Pentagon. 
He was a rock-jawed, six-foot, two- 
hundred pound man whom little 
could shock and nothing could de- 
ter. But he had never faced a chal- 
lenge like the seconds of silence that 
followed Dr. Smith’s mocking 
question. 

There was nothing he dared say, 
yet in saying nothing he was saying 
everything. FBI Agent Frank 
Cowles looked at him, then looked 
quickly away. Security Officer 
Busch studied his own hands as 
though discovering them for the 
first time. 

The tableau remained frozen and 
silent until the door opened and a 
doctor said, 

“That’s all for today, gentle- 
men.” 

The three men left without a 
word. 

Dr. John O’Hara Smith closed 
his eyes. On his pale lips was the 
suggestion of a smile. 

When they were alone in the 
General’s staff car, Amos Busch 
exhaled and said, 

“I’ll be damned.” 

“I gather,” observed Cowles dri- 
ly, “that something called an X-15 
has turned up missing.” 

“A week ago,” sighed General 
Sanders. “Somewhere in the Mo- 
jave Desert near Lancaster ... It 
was a very elementary prototype — 
the actual X-15 won’t be ready for 
another three years . .” 

“Any idea what happened to it?” 

“It was on a routine test flight 
and ran out of the tracking screen 

EDDIE 



— headed northwest . We haven’t 
found a splinter from it! But there’s 
a lot of rough country around 
there.” 

“Who knows it was lost?” 

“Just the local base and our 
headquarters staff. The Pentagon, 
too, of course.” 

“And Dr. Smith,” added Amos 
Busch, incredulously. 

The staff car detoured off the 
freeway to deliver Cowles to the 
Federal Building. 

“What do you make of this, 
Frank?” the General asked him. 

“I’m just supposed to be gather- 
ing information.” 

“Oh, hell! We’ve been talking 
and you’ve been thinking — what?” 

Cowles grinned. 

“I’ve been thinking how lucky 
it is I don’t have to make a decision 
about Smith!” 

“So?” 

“So we’ll question him again 
tomorrow ... As long as he’s will- 
ing to talk, the more he says, the 
better.” 

But, next morning, the medical 
staff again exercised its veto power. 
John O’Hara Smith had developed 
an infection and fever during the 
night. There could be no further 
questioning for the time being. 

On the second day, when his 
fever ebbed, Dr. Smith irascibly or- 
dered a pad of paper and began an 
interminable series of sketches. The 
nurse managed to sneak out a few 
of them, and FBI experts sat up 
all night vainly trying to figure out 
what they meant. 

The following evening, when the 
last visitor’s bell had sounded and 
the patients were bedded down for 

83 




the night, Dr. Smith was staring un- 
blinkingly into the dark shadows 
of his room. He had been given a 
sleeping pill at 9:30, but had held 
it under his tongue until the nurse 
left, and then had put it on the 
night table behind his thick- 
rimmed glasses. He seemed to be 
struggling with a problem. Once he 
turned on the night light, put on 
his glasses and made several rapid 
sketches that vaguely resembled a 
spider web. 

A half hour later, his eyes began 
to droop. He picked up the sleeping 
pill, rolled it between his thumb and 
forefinger, then put it back on the 
table. His breathing became deeper. 

A sound startled him awake. It 
was an odd sound, not a part of 
the subdued hospital noises. It was 
a persistent, metallic, scraping 
sound, and it came from outside 
his window. 

Dr. John O’Hara Smith grabbed 
his glasses and rolled out of bed. He 
bunched up his pillow under the 
covers and crawled into the deeper 
darkness of the corner to the left 
of the window, which was open 
several inches. He crouched there, 
knees quivering from weakness. 

There followed an interval of 
almost inaudible prying at the 
screen, broken by periods of silence 
as someone outside the second- 
story window apparently paused to 
listen. Finally, the screen was re- 
leased with a faint pop. The lower 
half of the double-hung window 
eased upwards. 

Again there was silence, save for 
the distant clatter of the self-service 
elevator. 

Abruptly, a pencil-thin beam of 



light shot through the room, toward 
the bed. It focussed on the mound 
made by the pillow. 

Short tongues of flame leaped out 
three times, with soft, spitting 
sounds. The pillow and the tangle 
of blankets twitched realistically. 

The beam of light winked out; 
the screen plopped back into place. 
There were a few hasty, sliding 
noises of retreat, and that was all. 

John O’Hara Smith’s breath 
came in short, strained gasps, as 
though he were choked up with 
asthma. When he got control of 
himself, he eased back the edge of 
the drape and looked out the win- 
dow. It was nearly twenty feet to 
the ground. A car turned off the 
boulevard, and came up the side 
street. The glow of its headlights 
briefly silhouetted the ladder angled 
against the side of the hospital. 

Dr. Smith sat on the edge of 
the bed to think things over. His 
left thumb probed the holes in the 
blanket ana pillow. This seemed 
to make up his mind. 

He got his clothes from the closet 
and dressed as quickly as he could 
force his hands to move and co- 
ordinate. His trousers hung so loosly 
that the last hole in his belt made 
no difference. He pulled the belt 
tight and knotted it. 

Next, he carefully folded his 
sketches and put them in the inside 
pocket of his coat. As an after- 
thought, he also put the sleeping 
pill in his pocket. Then he drank 
half a glass of water and painfully 
edged himself out the window. His 
chest scraped the ledge, and it was 
all he could do to strangle an out- 
cry of pain.

FRANK RILEY 




At the foot of the ladder, he stag- 
gered and nearly fell. But after a 
moment’s rest, he squared his 
shoulders and walked across a cor- 
ner of the lawn, into the shadows 
and the night. 

HE LOS ANGELES Mirror- 
News got further than any 
other paper with the story of Dr. 
John O’Hara Smith’s mysterious 
disappearance from General Hos- 
pital, leaving behind a bed riddled 
with three bullets. In fact, the Mir- 
ror-News story had cleared the 
copy desk and was on its way down 
to the composing room before it 
was killed by the managing editor 
“for security reasons”. 

An all-points police bulletin was 
sent out, but no one was optimistic 
about immediate results. When you 
can’t admit a man is missing, when 
you can’t publish his photograph, 
you deprive yourself of the eyes and 
ears of the public, which turn up 
seventy-five percent of the leads in 
missing persons cases. 

Security considerations posed 
three alternatives: 

If Dr. Smith was telling the 
truth, then it was better to let who- 
ever had twice tried to kill him 
wonder whether the second attempt 
had been successful. 

If Smith had broken with an 
espionage ring, and had been 
marked for death by former asso- 
ciates, the various agencies con- 
cerned with security wanted a 
chance to find him first. 

If Smith was playing some de- 
vious game of his own, let him 
make the next move. 



As days went by, telephone cir- 
cuits from Washington to Los 
Angeles carried messages that grew 
increasingly uncomplimentary. FBI 
headquarters hinted that certain 
field representatives might be trans- 
ferred from Southern California to 
southern Kansas if results in the 
Smith case were not forthcoming 
promptly. The Air Force suggested 
that if both Dr. Smith and the 
X-15 prototype continued to be 
among the misusing, it would not 
be wise to present the pending pro- 
motion of General Sanders to the 
White House. 

The General was moodily digest- 
ing this thought, while half-listen- 
ing to a discussion at a morning 
staff conference, when an aide 
whispered : 

“A call from the North American 
Lancaster plant, Sir. It’s urgent — 
and personal . .” 

General Sanders excused himself 
and hurried into his adjoining pri- 
vate office. 

“Sanders,” he barked. 

The high, imperious voice that 
replied was instantly recognizable: 

“General Sanders, I suggest you 
don’t try to have this call traced, 
or we might not be able to finish 
our conversation!” 

The General pressed his inter- 
com button and held the connec- 
tion open, waiting for a chance to 
use it. 

“Go ahead, Smith,” he said. 

“I’ll come directly to the point,” 
said Smith. “I want two things: A 
place to work in safety and the 
funds to build another Eddie!” 

“And what makes you think you 
can get them from me?” 




EDDIE 



85 




“Because Eddie can help you 
find the X-15.” 

The General hunched closer to 
the intercom, raising his voice. 

“Smith/* he stalled, “why don’t 
you come in and talk things over?” 
“I do not intend to sit around 
waiting to be killed while your 
security bunglers try to decide 
whether I’m telling the truth!” 

A Staff Sergeant looked in the 
door. 

“Is anything wrong, Sir?** 

The General motioned for 
silence, then scrawled on a note 
pad: 

“Trace this call!” 

“Now, Dr. Smith,” he said, “if 
you’re telling us the truth, you’ve 
got nothing to worry about . .” 
“General,” Smith replied acidly, 
“do you know any better way of 
convincing you than to let Eddie 
find the X-15?” 

“Well, I—” 

“Goodby, General. You think it 
over — and I’ll call you later. Your 
word will be sufficient!” 

The phone clicked, and General 
Sanders cursed bitterly. Later, he 
talked it over with Amos Busch, 
who nodded agreement to the Gen- 
eral’s proposal. 

“Sure,” he said. “It’s worth a 
gamble — and we’ll have Smith 
where we want him!” 

When John O’Hara Smith 
phoned that afternoon, the General 
said promptly: 

“Come on in, Dr. Smith — you’ve 
got a deal.” 

The available records on this 
phase of the case show that a Dr. 
J. O. Smith and three “assistants” 
were added to the payroll of a small 

86 



Pasadena electronics firm on Sep- 
tember 17, 1955. They were in- 
stalled in one wing on the top floor 
of the building. The entrance to 
this wing was sealed off with the 
familiar sign: “Restricted — Per- 

mission to enter granted only on a 
need-to-know basis”. 

Apparently, few needed to know, 
for Smith and his assistants seldom 
had visitors. Deliveries of electron- 
ics components were received by 
one of the assistants. The four men 
arrived together, and left together. 
They brought their lunch. 

Dr. Smith, of course, had been 
interrogated briefly when he had 
turned himself in at USAF Western 
Division Headquarters. But only the 
General and Amos Busch had 
questioned him this time. 

“Look, Smith,” said Amos, “if 
we’re supposed to protect you, I 
want to know from what — and why 
it’s necessary . .” 

John O’Hara Smith looked al- 
most embarrassed. 

“I suppose I made the same er- 
ror that is so often made in declassi- 
fying information . .” 

“How’s that?” 

“When information is declassi- 
fied, it’s done without mathemati- 
cally computing the infinite number 
of possible ways such information 
may be useful to a hostile govern- 
ment ... Of course, you need an 
Eddie to make such a computa- 
tion!” 

“What’s this got to do with trying 
to knock you off?” Busch de- 
manded. 

“It’s quite evident that someone 
read my article in the Research 
Engineers’ journal more carefully 

FRANK RILEY 




than you did! As a matter of fact, 
Eddie actually warned me that any- 
one hostile to the United States 
could not possibly allow my work 
to continue!” 

Amos Busch and General San- 
ders exchanged wary glances. 

“All right,” said General Sanders, 
“We’ll let that go for the moment 
— but what made you ask about the 
X-15 in the first place?” 

“Eddie suggested that if the 
ICBM missiles could theoretically 
be stolen over the mid-Atlantic, it 
would be vastly less difficult to steal 
an X-15 over the Mojave Desert!” 

As the two Air Force men di- 
gested this statement, along with 
the indisputable fact that an X-15 
had disappeared, John O’Hara 
Smith blandly informed them: 

“Incidentally, gentlemen, you’ll 
have to get Eddie’s duplicate tapes 
for me.” 

Busch reddened, and could not 
resist asking: 

“Including those short-wave 
broadcasts from Moscow Radio?” 

“Naturally!” Dr. Smith snapped. 
“I’m sure Eddie extracts a great 
deal of useful information from 
them!” 

This second interrogation, like 
the previous one in the hospital, 
ended on a triumphant note for the 
exasperating Dr. Smith. When they 
were alone, General Sanders turned 
to Busch and sighed: 

“We’ve got a double security 
problem, Amos! If word of this 
deal with Smith gets back to Wash- 
ington, I’ll be laughed right out of 
the service!” 

But the General didn’t begin to 
grasp the full implications of his 

EDDIE 



predicament until the afternoon of 
Oct. 7, when Dr. Smith phoned to 
say Eddie was completed. 

“Good,” grunted the General. 
“Get going, then!” 

“We’ll need more information 
first.” 

“What kind of information?” 
General Sanders demanded sus- 
piciously. 

His suspicions were reinforced by 
Smith’s terse dictum: 

“Eddie must have all the facts 
on the X-15.” 

“Impossible!” 

Dr. Smith’s sniff indicated he 
nurtured utter disbelief in the con- 
cept of the impossible. 

“Eddie operates on facts,” he re- 
minded the General. 

General Sanders didn’t sleep 
much that night. Neither did Amos 
Busch. They talked and argued 
until three in the morning, when 
the General poured one last drink 
and raised his glass. 

“O.K.,” he said grimly. “I’ve 
gone this far and I’ve got to go the 
rest of the way!” 

They drank, and he continued: 

“At least, now I won’t have to 
worry about being laughed out of 
the service — I’ll get court-martialed 
out!” 

He jabbed viciously at an ice- 
cube with his forefinger. 

“But there’s one thing I’ll do 
first,” he promised. 

“What’s that, Sir?” 

“Strangle Smith with my bare 
hands!” 

General Sanders sat on a metal 
folding chair in front of Eddie, the 
educatable computer, and stared 

87 




belligerently at the roughly-finished 
aluminum facade. 

Eddie didn’t look like much — 
certainly nothing like $13,456.12 
worth of components paid for out 
of the General’s contingency fund. 
Speed had been the primary con- 
sideration in rebuilding Eddie. The 
exterior case was unpainted, and 
rather inexpertly held together with 
metal screws. There were no knobs 
on the front panel controls. The vo- 
cader grill was open; the input 
microphone simply rested on the 
workbench beside the case. The en- 
tire assembly measured about three 
feet long, two feet deep and 
eighteen inches high. 

“O.K., what do I do now?” 
rasped the General. 

“Just start talking — into the 
mike.” 

General Sanders took a sheaf of 
papers from his briefcase. He glared 
at Smith: 

“You get the hell out of here! 
This is classified information!” 

Dr. Smith smiled mockingly. On 
his way out of the room, he paused. 

“The circuits will stay open — 
take as long as you wish.” 

Feeling like a combination of fool 
and Benedict Arnold, General 
Sanders cleared his throat and be- 
gan to read: 

“The North American X-15 is 
one of several projects now nearing 
the hardware stage that will take 
living men as well as instruments 
into the fourth environment of 
military activity, that of space. 

“As soon as the satellite project 
completes preliminary exploration 
of the massive high energy spec- 
trometer, the X-15’s system should 

88 



be ready to fly within two years. 
X-15s A, B, and G will explore 
3000 mph, 50 mi. up; 4500 mph, 
100 mi. up; and 6000 mph and 
over, 150 mi. up and out . .” 

General Sanders jerked open his 
tie. His tanned bald head was damp 
with sweat. He glanced around the 
empty workroom, set his jaw stub- 
bornly and continued: 

“Meanwhile, tests are in progress 
with a pilot model of X-15 to work 
out an entirely new vehicle system 
slow enough to maintain laminar 
flow in the boundary layer and fast 
enough to maintain control effec- 
tiveness at near sea-level environ- 
ment. Unlike the ICBM which 
need only remain lethal for a few 
seconds, both the X-15 and its per- 
sonnel must return to fly again . .” 

For three hours, General Sanders 
read steadily from his file material. 
During the last half hour, his voice 
grew husky, his throat dry and raw. 

When he finished, he went to the 
door and shouted : 

“All right, Smith . Come in 
here and put this damn thing to 
work!” 

Smith came in and informed him 
imperturbably : 

“Not so fast, General! Eddie will 
still require a great deal more in- 
formation.” 

“More? Dammit, I covered ev- 
erything!” 

“Everything you know about the 
X-15,” Dr. Smith agreed, “but Ed- 
die is now venturing into a new 
field and must have more than 
technical electronics and avionics 
data. He needs complete reports on 
the progress of the search to date, 
as well as the weather, topography, 

FRANK RILEY 




economy, history and current hap- 
penings in the entire peripheral 
area. I have built a supplemental 
circuit to accommodate this sort of 
material . .” 

General Sanders groaned. 

“How the hell do I get into these 
things ?” 

During the next ten days, Eddie 
scanned microfilm on all the news- 
papers published since X-15’s dis- 
appearance. Also marshalled before 
the scanner was every pertinent 
reference work available at public, 
private and university libraries in 
California. 

At length, even John O’Hara 
Smith seemed satisfied. He shut off 
the scanner, turned on the selector 
mechanism and the vocader switch. 

For two hours, Eddie did 
nothing, except hum contentedly, 
like a miniature washing machine. 
Occasionally, a weird, flickering 
pattern of multi-colored lights 
would trace across the scanning 
screen. 

At 11:06 A.M., October 19, 
1955, a flat, toneless voice came 
from the vocader grill: 

“Laminar flow equilibrium tem- 
perature at mach 8.0, altitude 150,- 
000 ft., of a point 10 ft. back 
from the leading edge is 1000 de- 
grees Fahrenheit, assuming skin has 
0.85 emissivity.” 

There was a small, whirring 
noise, and the vocader circuit 
clicked off. 

“What the devil does that 
mean?” demanded the General. 

“Your aerophysicists might like 
to know!” came back the tart reply. 

At 1:34, Eddie clicked into ac- 
tion again : 

EDDIE 



“In flight between two planets, 
the theory of minimum energy orbit 
should be discarded in favor of 
acceleration at reduced speed for 
calculated periods of time.” 

“By the time we’re flying between 
planets,” General Sanders com- 
mented bitterly, “the record of my 
court-martial will be ancient his- 
tory!” 

Twenty minutes later, Eddie 
added: 

“In the operation of small ex- 
ploration vehicles, the fuel cell of 
the 4-H Clubs in Hanford and Bit- 
teroot Creek will compete with the 
chemical energy of recombination 
for the prize sweet potato trophy.” 

Even John O’Hara Smith looked 
startled. But he recovered his ap- 
lomb instantly. 

“Must be a circuit crossover,” he 
explained. “No trouble to adjust 
it ...” 

While he probed into the interior 
of Eddie with a glass-handled 
screwdriver, General Sanders took 
out a fresh cigarette and shredded 
it between his fingers. 

At 2:51, Eddie had this to re- 
port: 

“Just as the basic physical pre- 
cept of invariancy to reflection is 
not necessarily true, Newton’s laws 
of motion may not always apply 
under certain circumstances. This 
would make it possible to penetrate 
and misdirect a navigational system 
based on the concept of inertial 
guidance.” 

General Sanders had been tilted 
back in his chair, half dozing. He 
bounced forward with a jar. 

“What was that?” 

Dr. Smith replayed this portion 

89 




of the output tape. 

“We talked about that at the 
hospital/’ he sternly recalled to the 
General. “And if the long-range 
missiles fired from Florida can be 
taken over in flight, what’s to pre- 
vent their being guided to a sub- 
marine at sea?” 

The General frowned in deep 
concentration, then relaxed and 
shook his head. 

“Even if something like that 
would be possible, we’ve got 
nothing to worry about. Every mis- 
sile carries a device which can be 
used to destroy it if the missile goes 
off course.” 

John O’Hara Smith shook his 
head like a teacher confronted with 
a pupil who was not too bright. 

“Now, General, if an inertial 
guidance system can be penetrated, 
a destructor can be blocked.” 

“That’s a mighty big if,” the 
General shot back. 

Dr. Smith smiled sardonically. 

“It may not be so big when Ed- 
die tells us what happened to the 
X-15!” 

“When!” the General groaned. 
Then he came back to the problem 
of intercepted ICBM missiles. Half 
seriously, half sarcastically, he 
asked : 

“What does Eddie think we 
should do about those missiles?” 

“Undoubtedly there are other 
guidance systems that can’t be 
broken so easily . meanwhile, Ed- 
die suggests booby-trapping the 
missiles so they’ll explode when 
tampered with.” 

General Sanders closed his eyes 
again, and tilted back his chair. 
The frown between his eyes 

90 



deepened. 

It was six o’clock, and the early 
dusk was closing in on the work- 
room, before another statement 
came from Eddie. In its character- 
istic monotone, the educatable com- 
puter said: 

“The existing developmental 
missile program will not be affected 
by the rising divorce rate in Bakers- 
field and Kern County.” 

Dr. John O’Hara Smith pursed 
his lips in disapproval. 

“Eddie’s not behaving at all well! 
I’m afraid that new circuit relay 
will take some working over . .” 

General Sanders climbed slowly 
to his feet. He picked up his hat. 

“O.K., Smith,” he said, “You 
sold me a bill of goods, and I 
bought it! Now I’m turning you 
and this whole damn mess back to 
the FBI! Let Cowles go crazy for 
awhile!” 



A S FRANK COWLES sat in the 
General’s office and heard what 
had been going on, he said mildly: 
“Well, I guess you had to take 
the gamble.” 

“Thanks,” said General Sanders. 
“I hope the Pentagon will look at 
it the same way — but I doubt it!” 
“We’ve got a problem, too, Gen- 
eral,” Cowles pointed out. “When 
everything’s said and done, there’s 
absolutely no charge we can file 
against Smith.” 

“But he just can’t walk away — 
not with all he — or that miserable 
Eddie — knows about the X-15!” 
Cowles smiled faintly. 

“I would imagine that Eddie now 
belongs to the Air Force.” 

FRANK RILEY 




“We’ll break the damn thing up 
for scrap!” 

The General’s intercom buzzed. 
An aide’s voice said apologetically: 

“That Dr. Smith is calling you 
again, Sir.” 

“Tell him to go to hell!” 

A few seconds later, the inter- 
com buzzed again. 

“Dr. Smith on the line, Sir — He 
says it’s something about the X-15 
missile.” 

General Sanders looked as 
though he wanted to sweep the in- 
tercom off his desk. 

“Why not talk to him,” Cowles 
suggested. “I’d like to hear this.” 

The General picked up his 
phone, and said with deceptive 
calm: 

“All right, Smith . make it 
short.” 

“It was the logging truck,” Dr. 
Smith replied, in his most superior 
manner. 

“Huh?” 

“Eddie’s circuit is coordinated 
now. He says that the same after- 
noon the X-15 disappeared, a pas- 
senger car ran into the back of a 
logging truck northbound on High- 
way 395, about fifty miles from the 
Lancaster base. Two people were 
killed 

“Smith, what kind of pipedream 
are you peddling now?” 

“General, the truck was loaded 
with redwood logs and heading 
north!” 

“I don’t give a damn where it 
was going!” 

“Wait, General!” Dr. Smith’s 
tone was almost a command. “Ed- 
die wants to know why a logging 
truck was traveling toward the red- 



wood country with a load of logs. 
He also points out that the X-15 
is about the size of a redwood log, 
and could be concealed perfectly in 
the middle of a load!” 

The General seemed to be swal- 
lowing something angular and un- 
pleasant. 

“We’ll check that truck,” he said, 
at last. “But remember, Smith, 
you’ve had it — you’ll never hook 
me again!” 

He put down the phone, and said 
to Cowles: 

“You get on the merry-go-round 
this time!” 

The California Highway Patrol 
in Mojave had the report on the 
accident. Clearly, it had been the 
fault of the passenger car. The 
truck driver was identified in the 
report as Art Backus, an independ- 
ent hauler, working out of Eureka, 
located on the far northern tip of 
the California coast, about eight 
hundred miles from the scene of 
the accident. 

A routine check by the FBI dis- 
closed that Backus had done time 
in San Quentin on a morals charge 
involving a minor girl. He had 
driven trucks for a dozen lumber 
companies in northwest California 
until the past summer, when he had 
bought a new truck and trailer, for 
cash, and gone into business for 
himself. 

Two FBI agents stepped up to 
him in a roadside cafe on Highway 
1, between Eureka and Trinidad 
Bay. A gaunt, stooped man, he 
nearly collapsed when the agents 
showed him their identifications. 
He was broken, and ready to talk, 



EDDIE 



91 




even before mention was made of 
the fact that the penalty for peace- 
time espionage is death. 

Backus guided the FBI to an a- 
bandoned sawmill, some two miles 
inland, where the X-15 had been 
taken apart, minutely photo- 
graphed, and then sunk in the old 
log pond. 

The men who had hired Backus 
and dismantled the X-15 had left 
the area several weeks earlier. They 
were remembered with friendliness 
by the residents of Trinidad Bay, 
who described them as “real nice 
guys and good fishermen, too.” 
They had told Backus they would 
be back in the late autumn for the 
steelhead run, and perhaps would 
have some more hauling business 
for him at that time. 

The FBI offered Backus one 
chance for life. He accepted it, with 
abject eagerness. 

Beyond this point, there are no 
more available records on the case 
of Dr. John O’Hara Smith, and 
Eddie, the educatable computer. 
But several items, not apparently 
related in any way, make interest- 
ing speculation. 

On January 3, 1956, the Air 
Force reported that a Thor inter- 
mediate-range ballistic missile, 
launched from Patrick Air Force 
Base, Florida, had been destroyed 
when it appeared to be wandering 
off course. 

About the same date, a Pana- 
manian freighter, riding the gulf- 
stream toward the West Indies, 



radioed a report of sighting a mas- 
sive oil slick and a scattering of 
debris, some of it bearing Russian 
insignia. No survivors were found. 

The U.S. State Department so- 
licitously inquired of the Soviet 
Union if any of its vessels had been 
lost in the winter storms of the 
Caribbean. The Soviet Union testily 
replied that no Soviet vessels could 
have been lost, since Soviet vessels, 
as a matter of sound international 
principle, confined their operations 
to their own territorial waters. 

During Easter Week of 1956, the 
FBI announced the arrests of four 
men on charges of espionage: A 
druggist in Tucson, Arizona; an im- 
porter in San Francisco; a retired 
real-estate operator in Los Angeles; 
an obscure trucker in northern 
California. All pleaded guilty in or- 
der to escape the gas chamber. The 
details of the charges against them 
were not disclosed, except to mem- 
bers of a Federal Grand Jury. 

Two other published items are 
worth noting: 

The May, 1956, issue of the 
journal published by the Institute 
of Research Engineers reported 
that one of its members, Dr. J. O. 
Smith, had recovered from injuries 
suffered in the explosion of a bu- 
tane stove and had accepted a gov- 
ernment research position in Wash- 
ington, D.C. 

The other item was a paragraph 
in Aviation Weekly, congratulating 
Major General David William San- 
ders on his promotion to Brigadier 
General. END

If secrecy can be carried, to the brink of madness, what can hap- 



pen when imprisonment and time are added to super secrecy? 



SECURITY 



W E, SAM LEWIS thought as 
he lay in the dark trying to 
sober up, are the living dead. 

It was a death without honor. 
It was a death of dusty, sterile 
stupidity. It was wretched, shame- 
ful, a human waste, and far too 
ridiculous a business to bear any 
longer. 

The hell with the war. The hell 
with the government. The hell with 
Secret Project X, Y, Z, or D, or 
whatever infantile code letter iden- 
tified the legalized tomb in which 
Sam and the others had been in- 



carcerated too long. 

He flung his hand around in the 
dark in a gesture of self-contempt. 
And his hand found the soft con- 
tours of a woman’s breast. Her 
warm body moved, sighed beside 
him as he turned his head and 
stared at the dim outline of Pro- 
fessor Betty Seton’s oval face, soft 
and unharried in sleep. Unharried, 
and unmarried, he thought. 

Good God. He detached his 
hand, slipped out of bed and stood 
in the middle of the floor, found his 
nylon coverall and sandals, dressed

silently, and opened the door to get 
out of Betty’s apartment, but fast. 

He glanced back, his face hot 
with bitterness and his mouth twist- 
ing with disgust. She moved slight- 
ly, and he knew she was awake and 
looking at him. 

“Darling,” she said thickly, “don’t 



go- 






She was awake but still drifting 
in the euphoria of Vat 69. 

He felt both sad and very mean. 
Then he shut the door behind him, 
ran out into the desert night. The 
line of camouflaged barracks on one 
side, the grounds including the lab 
buildings, all loomed up darkly un- 
der the starlight. He took a deep 
breath. 

Now, he asked himself, have you 
the guts to get out, tell them off, 
make the gesture? It won’t do any 
good. Nobody else will care or un- 
derstand. They’re too numb and re- 
signed. You’ll never get past the 
fence. The Guards will haul you in 
to the Wards and work you over. 
They’ll work over what’s left until 
what’s left won’t be worth carrying 
over to the incinerator with the 
other garbage in the morning. 
You’ll be brainwashed and cleared 
until you’re on mental rock bottom 
and won’t even know what direc- 
tion up is, and you won’t give a 
damn. 



But don’t you have the guts even 
to make the gesture, just for the 
sake of what’s left of your integrity, 
before they dim down your futile 
brain cells to a faint glow of final 
and perpetual mediocrity? 

Betty and he had clung to some 
integrity, had made a point of not 
getting too intimate, a kind of chal- 



lenge, a hold-out against the deca- 
dence of the Project. What was left 
now of any self-respect? 

A security Guard with his white 
helmet and his white leather har- 
ness and his stungun, sauntered by 
and Lewis ducked into the shadows 
beside the barracks. His heart 
skipped several thumps as the 
Guard paused, looked at the en- 
trance to Betty’s apartment. Maybe 
someone had reported his liaison 
with Betty. 

Beautiful and desirable as she 
was, and as much as he wanted to 
marry her, he had not been able to 
marry Betty Seton. If the war ever 
ended, if the security curtain was 
ever lifted, if they were ever let out 
of compulsive Government employ- 
ment, then they would get married. 
That was what they had kept tell- 
ing one another during # quick secret 
meetings. 

If , if, if— 

Somewhere along the trail of this 
last alcoholic binge, one or both of 
them had abandoned what they had 
both considered an important tradi- 
tion. It wasn’t much, but they had 
clung to it against temptation, 
knowing that once they gave in, it 
wasn’t much further to the bottom 
of skidhill. 

Betty Seton had been a world 
famous physicist. Sam Lewis had 
been a top-rate atomics engineer. 
And what are we now, he thought, 
watching the Guard, except just a 
couple of alky bums looking for a 
few extra kicks to keep us from ad- 
mitting we’re dead? 

A request for a marriage license 
had never been answered. Betty 
Seton did not have “Q” clearance 



94 



BRYCE WALTON 




for some reason. Sam had full clear- 
ance and worked in The Pit, the 
highest “Q” security section in the 
Project. And never the twain could 
meet. If their little tryst was dis- 
covered, Betty Seton would be taken 
to the mental wards and ‘cleared’, 
a polite term for having any secur- 
ity info you might have picked up 
cleaned out of your brain along 
with a great many other character- 
istics that made you a distinct per- 
sonality. It was just one of those 
necessary evils. It had to be done. 
For security. Psychological murder 
in the name of Security. 

The Guard walked on and dis- 
appeared around the corner of the 
end barracks building. 

Lewis started walking aimlessly 
in the dark, up and down in front 
of the barracks, past the blacked 
out windows and doors and the 
shadowy hulks of the lab buildings, 
and beyond that the camouflaged 
entrances to other subterranean 
labs, the synthetic food plants, the 
stores, and supplies. The Project 
was self-sustaining; in complete, se- 
cure and sterile isolation from the 
world, from all of humanity. 

He headed for Professor Melvin 
Lanier’s apartment. Tonight the 
big party was at Lanier’s. There 
was a drunken brawl going on all 
the time at someone’s apartment. 
There was nothing else to do. 

Liquor, tranquillizing drugs, wife- 
swapping, dope addiction, dream- 
pills, sleeping tablets, and that was 
it. That was what the Project had 
come to. Experimental work at the 
Project had wobbled to a dead end. 

Only the pathetic and meaning- 
less motions remained. 



Still, he thought, as he walked in 
through the open door of Lanier’s 
apartment, there is a war on. H- 
bombs and A-bombs outlawed, but 
anything less than that was sporting. 

He wanted to do what he could, 
but he was squelched ; just as every- 
one else here was smothered and 
rendered useless by regulations and 
a Government of complete and ab- 
solute secrecy carried to its ultimate 
stupid denominator in the hands of 
political and military incompetents. 

Still, there is a war on, he 
thought again as he walked into 
the big living room filled with arti- 
ficial light and even more artificial 
laughter. Was it possible to do 
something, just some little thing, to 
shake loose this caged brain? 

A few more drinks, he thought, 
will help me reach another com- 
pletely indecisive decision. 

In another two hours he would 
have to report back to the Pit. No 
reason for it now. It was just his 
job, his patriotic duty. Progress in 
nuclear developments and reactor 
technology in the Pit had ground 
to a dismal halt for him over seven 
months ago. 

Yes, no doubt about it, he needed 
a few more shots to make palatable 
for a while longer his standing 
membership in the walking dead. 

Through shadows in the garden, 
shapes wavered about drunkenly to 
the throb of hi-fi. Lewis went to the 
robotic barkeep and started drink- 
ing. This time, however, he didn’t 
feel any effects. He stood looking 
around, ashamed, made sicker by 
what he saw: some of the world’s 
finest minds, top scientists, reduced 



SECURITY 



95 




to shallow burbling buffoons. 

Dave Nemerov, Nobel Prize Win- 
ner in physics, weaved up to Sam 
and looked at him out of bleary 
eyes. “Hi, Sammy. All full of gloom 
again, boy?” 

Nemerov, a chubby little man 
dressed in short s and nothing else, 
frowned with drunken exaggera- 
tion. “Easy does it, Sajnmy. You 
might find the security boys giving 
you a lobotomy rap.” 

A drop of sweat ran down the 
side of Lewis’ high-boned cheek. 

“Well, what’s the great physicist 
been doing for his country?” Lewis 
asked. He knew that Nemerov 
hadn’t even been in his lab for over 
a month. He even remembered 
when Nemerov had griped about 
the shortage of technically trained 
personnel, the policy of secrecy that 
clouded, divided and obstructed his 
work, hampered his research until 
it finally was no longer worth the 
struggle. His story was the story of 
everyone in the Project. He couldn’t 
get information from other depart- 
ments and projects, because of se- 
crecy. They were all cut off from 
one another. No information was 
ever released from the restricted list. 
Most important documents were 
secret, and had remained out of 
reach. 

The only declassified documents 
available in the project were grade- 
school stuff that everybody had 
known twenty years ago. 

For an instant, Nemerov ap- 
peared almost sober, and complete- 
ly saddened. 

“I’ve forgotten what I was work- 
ing on,” Nemerov said. 

“Have another drink then,” 



Lewis said, “and you’ll forget that 
you’ve forgotten.” 

They clinked glasses. “Smile, 
Sammy,” Nemerov said. “It can’t 
last forever. We’ll soon get the 
word. The war will be over.” 

“What war?” Lewis whispered. 

“Ssshhh, Sammy, for God’s 
sake!” Nemerov moistened his lips 
and looked around, but there 
weren’t any Guards at the party. 
There never were. The Guards had 
a barracks of their own in the Com- 
mander’s private sector. They never 
talked to civilians. They never at- 
tended parties. They kept strictly to 
themselves. So did the Commander. 
For almost a year now, as far as 
Lewis knew, no civilian in the Proj- 
ect had seen the Commander. His 
reports were issued daily. Occa- 
sionally his voice was heard on the 
intercom. 

“Wonder who is winning the war 
out there?” Lewis said, to no one in 
particular. He thought of Betty. 
Some whiskey spilled from the shot 
glass. 

“I wish you would shut up, Nem- 
erov said hoarsely. 

It still seemed incredible to Lewis, 
that the military psychologists had 
decided among themselves that, for 
the sake of security, all intercom- 
munication between the Project 
and the outside was to be cut off. 
No news, no television, no radio, no 
nothing. For security, and also on 
the theory that scientists could work 
better completely cloistered up like 
medieval monks. Not even a phone- 
call. Absolute, one-hundred percent 
isolation. Legalized catatonia. 

They had choked this Project to 
death, and he wondered how many 

BRYCE WALTON 



96 




others were dead, and where they 
were. He didn’t know where this 
Project was, except that it was on 
the desert. He didn’t even know 
for sure what desert. He had been 
drugged when he was brought here 
two years ago, for security you 
know. 

Nemerov never mentioned his 
wife and kids any more. From the 
behavior of Nemerov and most of 
the others, you would think the out- 
side^ no longer existed. 

Cardoza, the cybernetic genius, 
came up, his eyes glazed with the 
effects of some new narcotic that 
Oliver Dutton, world renowned bio- 
chemist, had cooked up for want 
of anything better to do. 

The wives of two other scientists 
hung on Cardoza’s arms, their 
bodies mostly bare, their eyes 
dulled as they wandered about the 
room like radar for the promise of 
some emotional oasis in the waste- 
land. 

“How you fellas like my robotic 
barkeep?” Cardoza yelled. 

“It pours a nice glass of whiskey,” 
Lewis said. 

“This is only the beginning,” 
Cardoza said, his mouth glistening 
and wet under his hopped-up eyes. 
“That barkeep’s a perfect servant 
and can never make a mistake. 
Spent the last year building it. It 
can mix anything.” 

“It’ll practically win the war for 
us,” Lewis said. Nemerov wiped at 
his sweating face. The two straying 
wives stared dumbly. 

Cardoza winced. “Don’t be cut- 
ting, my friend,” he said to Lewis. 
His mouth turned down at the cor- 
ners. “I tried, just as the rest of us 

SECURITY 



tried. To go on and develop what I 
was sent here to develop, I need 
“Q” clearance. I can’t get it be- 
cause when the war started I wasn’t 
a citizen. Is that clear, Lewis?” 
“Forget it,” Lewis said. 

“That’s what I intend to keep on 
doing,” Cardoza said. “Meanwhile, 
my little robotic barkeep is only the 
beginning. I’m working on other 
even more ingenious automata. One 
will do card tricks. Another is a 
tight-wire artist. And one can even 
tell fortunes.” 

“How about one that can drag 
humans out of a hat?” Lewis asked. 

“Come on, ladies,” Cardoza said 
as he moved away. “Let’s go play 
Dr. McWilliams’ new Q-X game.” 
“Ohhh,” one of the wives said, 
giggling. “Something new?” 

“Yeah,” Lewis said to her, think- 
ing of the fact that at one time, 
long ago and far away, McWil- 
liams had been working on a theory 
supposed to have been aimed far 
beyond Einstein. “McWilliams’ new 
mathmatical game. This one’s also 
played in the dark. Mixed couples 
of course. Q-X, the big mathmati- 
cal discovery of the age. People get 
lost in pairs and later in the dark 
they add up to bigger numbers.” 



L EWIS shoved off from the bar, 
and walked toward the far cor- 
ner of the garden where he saw old 
Shelby Stenger, the great atomics 
expert, flat on his belly, lying in the 
moonlight with fountain water mist- 
ing his face, snoring like a tired old 
dog, with a little thread of drool 
hanging out of the comer of his 
mouth. 

97 




Mac Brogarth, nuclear physicist, 
came waltzing grotesquely across the 
garden and toppled backward into 
the pool under the fountain and lay 
there too weak even to raise his 
head out of the water. He would 
have drowned if Lewis hadn’t lifted 
it out for him. 

The old man in Lewis’ arms 
looked up at Lewis with a passing 
light of tragic sobriety. 

“Sam Lewis,” he said. “That’s 
you, isn’t it, Sam? I had a cabin up 
near Lake Michigan and I was go- 
ing up there to finish important 
work. I’ll never get back there, Sam. 
I know now that I never will. I 
never will.” 

Lewis stood up. Without seeing 
or hearing anyone, he walked out 
into the dry coolness of the starlit 
desert night. 

He walked between the barracks, 
past the messhall toward the labs, 
turned down the length of that 
ominous looking hulk which con- 
cealed The Pit, and the Monster 
with which Lewis had worked until 
there was no use working any more. 
Beyond that, he saw the electric 
fence, and the white helmeted 
Guards standing at rigid attention. 

He walked over there, his shoes 
crunching on sand and gravel, and 
looked into the Guard’s face. It was 
a mask, expressionless, and rigid. 
Its eyes were hardly human, Lewis 
thought. It had many of the char- 
acteristics of Cardoza’s robotic bar- 
keep. 

Lewis knew that the security 
Guards had been worked over in 
the Wards until there was no pos- 
sibility of their being security risks. 
Any classified thought, even if it 



penetrated one side of their heads, 
quickly drained through the sieved 
brain and out the other side. 

“Carry on, soldier,” Lewis said. 
The Guard didn’t seem to hear. 

Lewis walked back toward the 
lab building covering The Pit. 

The conflict was like a knife 
slicing him apart inside. What if he 
made a grandstand gesture now? 
It would be much worse perhaps 
than merely being sent into the 
Wards for a little mental working 
over. He would be found guilty of 
sabotage, tried by the Commander’s 
kangaroo court martial, found 
guilty of being a traitor to his coun- 
try, a foreign agent probably. He 
would be placed inside a gas cham- 
ber on a stool and a little gas pellet 
would be dropped on his lap. 

And anyway, aside from his own 
punishment, would it be morally 
right? Maybe I’m the one who is 
crazy, he thought. Maybe it’s hell 
out there, reduced to God knew 
what kind of social chaos. Maybe 
we’re about to win. Maybe we’re 
about to lose. Maybe as bad as it is, 
it’s the best one could expect dur- 
ing the greatest crisis. 

He went inside, and took the ele- 
vator down one floor into the lead- 
lined Pit. 

He walked up to the control 
panel and looked through the thick 
layers of shielding transparent teflo- 
nite into the Pit, watching the 
Monster indirectly through the big 
lenticular screen disc above the 
control panel. 

The Monster stood in the lead- 
lined Pit, inactive, as it had been 
inactive for months. And even be- 



98 



BRYCE WALTON 




for that, during the months when 
Lewis was learning to control the 
Monster until it seemed an exten- 
sion of his own nervous system, its 
work had become useless, due to 
unobtainable documents and per- 
sonnel, not to mention lack of com- 
munication with other research 
centers. 

The Monster was part of a gen- 
eral plan to compensate for the out- 
lawing of A- and H-bombs. The 
most deadly conceivable compro- 
mise. The Pit was a deadly sea of 
radioactivity in which only a me- 
chanical robot monster could work. 
Outside the Pit, Lewis directed the 
Monster whose duty was the con- 
struction of drone planes. A few 
had been built, but they weren’t 
quite effective, and now it was im- 
possible to go on with the experi- 
mentation. The parts were all there. 
Everything was there except cer- 
tain vital classified documents that 
could not be cleared into this par- 
ticular Project. 

Thousands of drone planes were 
to have been built, and perhaps 
were being built in some other 
Project, but not in this one. Thou- 
sands of drone planes with raw, un- 
shielded atomic engines, light and 
inordinately powerful with an in- 
definite cruising range, remote con- 
trolled, free of fallible human 
agency, loaded with bacteriological 
bombs, the terrible gas known as 
the G-agent, and in addition, load- 
ed ‘spray’ tanks that would spew 
deadly gamma rays and neutrons 
over limitless areas of atmosphere. 

Lewis moved his hands over the 
sensitive controls, and through the 
lenticular disc, watched The Mon- 

SECURITY 



ster respond with the delicate ges- 
tures of a gigantic violinist. The 
Monster was a robot, ten times big- 
ger than Cardoza’s barkeep, and 
when Lewis moved his hands, the 
Monster moved its own huge man- 
dibles as its electro-magnum, col- 
loid brain, picked up Lewis’ mental 
directions. 

The Monster was immune to 
radiation, and bacteriological hor- 
rors. It swam in death as uncon- 
cerned as a lovely lady wallowed 
in a pink bubble-bath. 

Lewis sat in the twilight of the 
Pit making the monster move about 
in its futile rounds. Lewis loved the 
Monster and felt the wasteful trag- 
edy of its magnificent potential. A 
wonder of the world, a reaffirma- 
tion of man’s imagination and his 
powers of reason, the Monster was 
built for what might seem horribly 
destructive ends, but its potential 
was for limitless achievement of the 
best and most far-reaching in man. 
Yet here it was, doing nothing at 
all. Standing in a sea of radioactive 
poison, a gigantic symbol of man’s 
stupidity to man. 

Could a man know the truth and 
continue to deny it, and still remain 
sane? You could go on living that 
way. You could take happy pills, 
sleeping pills, dream-pills and stay 
lushed-up on government liquor. 
But sooner or later you would have 
to face the horrible empty waste. 
After that loomed the face of mad- 
ness. 

And yet, Lewis thought, how do 
I know that I know the truth? I’m 
cut off. No info, no communication. 
For all I know we’re the only peo- 
ple left in the world. An oasis of 

99 




secrecy surrounded by desert. 

Lewis walked back up to the first 
floor, and out into the night, head- 
ing for Betty Seton’s spartment. 
Maybe she was sober enough now 
to talk this thing over. The hell with 
security regulations. Just the same, 
he walked along in the shadow next 
to the building to avoid any eye- 
witness of his proposed rendezvous. 

Science, he thought, was really 
another name for freedom. It 
couldn’t function without freedom 
of thought, freedom of inquiry. You 
couldn’t mix it up with security and 
cut off communication, because 
communication is the essence of sci- 
ence. An idea is universal, and how 
can you go on thinking when you’re 
no longer a part of the world? 

Whatever the decision arrived at 
in Lewis’ own heart might otherwise 
have been, he was never to know. 
His decision was made for him by 
an hysterical laugh, the sound of 
scuffling on boards, and another 
laugh. He came around the corner 
of the barracks and saw the Guard 
manhandling Betty Seton down the 
steps of her apartment building. 

T HE GUARD was big, built like 
a wedge, with a flat bulldog 
face bunched up under his white 
helmet. The Guard’s brain had been 
carefully honed down to an efficient, 
completely unintelligent but precise 
fighting machine level. He neither 
knew nor cared why he did any- 
thing. But he was handicapped by 
having Betty Seton in one hand. He 
was whirling, raising his stungun 
with the other hand, when Lewis 
hit him. 

100 



Lewis drove in with his weight 
behind first a solid long blow that 
broke a rigid wall of muscle in the 
Guard’s belly, turned it to soft clay. 
Betty fell free and lay laughing on 
the gravel. Her face was a white 
smear in the starlight. 

Lewis brought his knee up into 
the Guard’s face as he bent over, 
sank another one into the soft belly, 
kicked the Guard in the crotch, 
stamped on his booted foot, came 
back and ran forward again, driv- 
ing his shoulder again into the 
Guard’s belly. The Guard’s feet hit 
the bottom step, he smashed into 
the boards, and his helmet flew off 
as his headed thudded on the 
stanchion. 

The Guard just shook his shaven 
head, started to get up heavily, 
reaching again for his stungun, his 
face expressionless. Lewis heard 
footsteps pounding around the cor- 
ner, slashing on gravel. 

More Guards. Dehumanized and 
insensitive, they were almost as in- 
vulnerable as so many robots — 

He turned, ran past Betty Seton, 
stilly lying there with only a thin 
housecoat around her, not laughing 
now, but looking suddenly sober 
and horrified. 

“Betty!” 

She stared up at him. A block 
away he could hear the Guards 
coming and he kept on running. He 
yelled back. 

“Get a jeep. Get Brogarth, Car- 
doza, Nemerov, anybody. We’re 
breaking out of here.” 

“Where?” he heard her yelling 
after him as he went around the 
corner. 

He glanced back around the cor- 
BRYCE WALTON 




ner and saw the herd of mechanized 
human beings slogging toward him. 

“Near the gate/’ Lewis said. 

He ran toward the Pit. 

He ran down the steps, into the 
console room and looked into the 
lenticular disc where a ghostly blue 
radiance shadowed the walls. 

“We’re going to do ourselves 
some good after all, Monster,” 
Lewis said tightly. 

He gripped the controls and sent 
the Monster its last set of orders. It 
hurled tons of drone plane motors 
into the shielding walls, and its 
huge mandibles ripped open the 
shielding and peeled it away like a 
food canister. Smoke began to boil. 
Flames crackled in blue arcs. Steel 
beams crumbled like wax. Globs of 
concrete fell in a cloud of dust swirl- 
ing debris. 

Lewis grabbed the intercom, 
dialed the Commander’s office. No 
answer. He got through the ex- 
change and got the Commander’s 
apartment. He heard a drunken 
whine and behind that the drunken 
depraved laughter of officers and 
their wives and the sound of bongo 
drums. 

“The Monster’s breaking out of 
the Pit,” Lewis said. “It’s shooting 
out more than enough deadly radio- 
activity to kill all of you if you don’t 
get the hell out and get out fast.” 

“What, what’s that?” 

“If you think I’m having a night- 
mare,” Lewis continued, “take a 
look out the window, Commanded.” 

Lewis dropped the intercom. The 
Monster could go quite a distance 
before it stopped, its remote control 
radius probably not exceeding three 
miles. 



The Monster went out of the Pit, 
taking walls and flooring with it. 
The entire structure trembled, 
beams fell, ceilings crumbled, and 
the Monster went through the 
smoking debris like a juggernaut. 

A Guard lay crushed under a 
steel beam. Lewis took the stungun 
from his hand and went up the 
debris choked stairs. Outside, he 
saw figures streaming out into the 
starlight, and the lab buildings 
bursting into flames. He also saw 
the Monster, glowing with bluish 
radiance, moving straight ahead to- 
ward the electric fence. 

The siren was screaming and 
howling. Shadows seemed to be 
streaming toward air-raid shelters. 
That was all right. The security 
curtain was torn down. They could 
come back up later into the light 
and wonder what had happened 
and find out where they really were. 

Guards were running about like 
ugly toys out of control, looking, lis- 
tening for commands. 

Lewis ran through thickening 
smoke, and saw the jeep by the 
South Gate. Betty was in it, together 
with Brogarth and Nemerov. 

“Hurry, hurry, run,” he heard 
Betty scream. 

The Guard was cutting at an 
angle toward Lewis, between him 
and the jeep. Beyond the Guard was 
a gaping hole in the fence and on 
the other side of that he could see 
the gigantic flickering nimbus of the 
Monster still walking toward the 
East. 

Lewis kept running. Five feet 
away he brought up the stungun 
and shot the Guard in the face.

LEARNING THEORY 

BY JAMES MCCONNELL 



I AM WRITING this because I presume He wants me 
to. Otherwise He would not have left paper and pencil 
handy for me to use. And I put the word “He” in capitals 
because it seems the only thing to do. If I am dead and 
in hell, then this is only proper. However, if I am merely 
a captive somewhere, then surely a little flattery won’t 
hurt matters. 

As I sit here in this small room and think about it, I 
am impressed most of all by the suddenness of the whole 
thing. At one moment I was out walking in the woods 
near my suburban home. The next thing I knew, here I 
was in a small, featureless room, naked as a jaybird, with 
only my powers of rationalization to stand between me 
and insanity. When the “change” was made (whatever 
the change was), I was not conscious of so much as a

momentary flicker between walking taneous anesthetic or He has solved 
in the woods and being here in this the problem of instantaneous trans- 
room. Whoever is responsible for all portation of matter. I would prefer 
of this is to be complimented — to think it the former, for the latter 
either He has developed an instan- leads to too much anxiety. 




As I recall, I was immersed in 
the problem of how to teach my 
class in beginning psychology some 
of the more abstruse points of 
Learning Theory when the transi- 
tion came. How far away life at the 
University seems at the moment: I 
must be forgiven if now I am much 
more concerned about where I am 
and how to get out of here than 
about how freshmen can be cajoled 
into understanding Hull or Tol- 
man. 

Problem # 1 : Where am I? For 
an answer, I can only describe this 
room. It is about twenty feet square, 
some twelve feet high, with no 
windows, but with what might be 
a door in the middle of one of the 
walls. Everything is of a uniform 
gray color, and the walls and ceiling 
emit a fairly pleasant achromatic 
light. The walls themselves are of 
some hard material which might 
be metal since it feels slightly cool 
to the touch. The floor is of a softer, 
rubbery material that yields a little 
when I walk on it. Also, it has a 
rather “tingly” feel to it, suggesting 
that it may be in constant vibra- 
tion. It is somewhat warmer than 
the walls, which is all to the good 
since it appears I must sleep on the 
floor. 

The only furniture in the room 
consists of what might be a table 
and what passes for a chair. They 
are not quite that, but they can 
be made to serve this purpose. On 
the table I found the paper and the 
pencil. No, let me correct myself. 
What I call paper is a good deal 
rougher and thicker than I am 
used to, and what I call a pencil is 
nothing more than a thin round 

104 



stick of graphite which I have 
sharpened by rubbing one end of it 
on the table. 

And that is the sum of my sur- 
roundings. I wish I knew what He 
has done with my clothes. The suit 
was an old one, but I am worried 
about the walking boots. I was very 
fond of those boots — they were 
quite expensive and I would hate 
to lose them. 

The problem still remains to be 
answered, however, as to just where 
in the hell I am — if not in hell it- 
self! 

Problem #2 is a knottier one — 
Why am I here? Were I subject to 
paranoid tendencies, I would 
doubtless come to the conclusion 
that my enemies had kidnapped me. 
Or perhaps that the Russians had 
taken such an interest in my re- 
search that they had spirited me 
away to some Siberian hideout and 
would soon appear to demand ei- 
ther cooperation or death. Sadly 
enough, I am too reality oriented. 
My research was highly interesting 
to me, and perhaps to a few other 
psychologists who like to dabble in 
esoteric problems of animal learn- 
ing, but it was scarcely startling 
enough to warrant such attention 
as kidnapping. 

So I am left as baffled as before. 
Where am I, and why? 

And who is He? 

I have decided to forego all at- 
tempts at* keeping this diary ac- 
cording to “days” or “hours.” Such 
units of time have no meaning in 
my present circumstances, for the 
light remains constant all the time 
I am awake. The human organism 

JAMES MC CONNELL 




is not possessed of as neat an in- 
ternal clock as some of the lower 
species. Far too many studies have 
shown that a human being who is 
isolated from all external stimula- 
tion soon loses his sense of time. So 
I will merely indicate breaks in the 
narrative and hope that He will un- 
derstand that if He wasn’t bright 
enough to leave me with my wrist- 
watch, He couldn’t expect me to 
keep an accurate record. 

Nothing much has happened. I 
have slept, been fed and watered, 
and have emptied my bladder and 
bowels. The food was waiting on 
the table when I awoke last time. 
I must say that He has little of the 
gourmet in Him. Protein balls are 
not my idea of a feast royal. How- 
ever, they will serve to keep body 
and soul together (presuming, of 
course, that they are together at the 
moment) . But I must object to my 
source of liquid refreshment. The 
meal made me very thirsty, and I 
was in the process of cursing Him 
and everybody else when I noticed 
a small nipple which had appeared 
in the wall while I was asleep. At 
first I thought that perhaps Freud 
was right after all, and that my 
libido had taken over control of my 
imagery. Experimentation con- 
vinced me, however, that the thing 
was real, and that it is my present 
source of water. If one sucks on the 
thing, it delivers a slightly cool and 
somewhat sweetish flow of liquid. 
But really, it’s a most undignified 
procedure. It’s bad enough to have 
to sit around all day in my birthday 
suit. But for a full professor to have 
to stand on his tip-toes and suck on 
an artificial nipple in order to ob- 

LEARNING THEORY 



tain water is asking a little too 
much. I’d complain to the Manage- 
ment if only I knew to whom to 
complain! 

Following eating and drinking, 
the call to nature became a little 
too strong to ignore. Now, I was 
adequately toilet-trained with in- 
door plumbing, and the absence of 
same is most annoying. However, 
there was nothing much to do but 
choose a corner of the room and 
make the best of a none too 
pleasant situation. (As a side- 
thought, I wonder if the choosing 
of a comer was in any way in- 
stinctive?). However, the upshot of 
the whole thing was my learning 
what is probably the purpose of the 
vibration of the floor. For the ex- 
creted material disappeared 
through the floor not too many 
minutes later. The process was a 
gradual one. Now I will be faced 
with all kinds of uncomfortable 
thoughts concerning what might 
possibly happen to me if I slept 
too long: 

Perhaps this is to be expected, 
but I find myself becoming a little 
paranoid after all. In attempting to 
solve my Problem #2, why I am 
here, I have begun to wonder if 
perhaps some of my colleagues at 
the University are not using me as 
a subject in some kind of experi- 
ment. It would be just like Mc- 
Cleary to dream up some fantastic 
kind of “human-in-isolation” ex- 
periment and use me as a pilot ob- 
server. You would think that he’d 
have asked my permission first. 
However, perhaps it’s important 
that the subject not know what’s 
happening to him. If so, I have one 

105 




happy thought to console me. If 
McCleary is responsible for this, 
he’ll have to take over the teaching 
of my classes for the time being. 
And how he hates teaching Learn- 
ing Theory to freshmen: 

You know, this place seems 
dreadfully quiet to me. 

Suddenly I have solved two of 
my problems. I know both where 
I am and who He is. And I bless 
the day that I got interested in the 
perception of motion. 

I should say to begin with that 
the air in this room seems to have 
more than the usual concentration 
of dust particles. This didn’t seem 
particularly noteworthy until I 
noticed that most of them seemed to 
pile up along the floor against one 
wall in particular. For a while I 
was sure that this was due to the 
ventilation system — perhaps there 
was an out-going airduct there 
where this particular wall was 
joined to the floor. However, when 
I went over and put my hand to 
the floor there, I could feel no 
breeze whatsoever. Yet even as I 
held my hand along the dividing 
line between the wall and the floor, 
dust motes covered my hand with 
a thin coating. I tried this same ex- 
periment everywhere else in the 
room to no avail. This was the 
only spot where the phenomenon 
occurred, and it occurred along the 
entire length of this one wall. 

But if ventilation was not re- 
sponsible for the phenomenon, 
what was? All at once there popped 
into my mind some calculations I 
had made when the rocket boys had 
first proposed a manned satellite 

106 



station. Engineers are notoriously 
naive when it comes to the per- 
formance of a human being in most 
situations, and I remembered that 
the problem of the perception of 
the satellite’s rotation seemingly had 
been ignored by the slip-stick crowd. 
They had planned to rotate the 
doughnut-shaped satellite in order 
to substitute centrifugal force for 
the force of gravity. Thus the outer 
shell of the doughnut would appear 
to be “down” to anyone inside the 
thing. Apparently they had not re- 
alized that man is at least as sensi- 
tive to angular rotation as he is to 
variations in the pull of gravity. As 
I figured the problem then, if a 
man aboard the doughnut moved 
his head as much as three or four 
feet outwards from the center of 
the doughnut, he would have be- 
come fairly dizzy! Rather annoying 
it would have been, too, to have 
been hit by a wave of nausea every 
time one sat down in a chair. Also, 
as I pondered the problem, it be- 
came apparent that dust particles 
and the like would probably show 
a tendency to move in a direction 
opposite to the direction of the ro- 
tation, and hence pile up against 
any wall or such that impeded their 
flight. 

Using the behavior of the dust 
particles as a clue, I then climbed 
atop the table and leapt off. Sure 
enough, my head felt like a mule 
had kicked it by the time I landed 
on the floor. My hypothesis was 
confirmed. 

So I am aboard a spaceship: 

The thought is incredible, but in 
a strange way comforting. At least 
now I can postpone worrying about 

JAMES MC CONNELL 




heaven and hell — and somehow I 
find the idea of being in a space- 
ship much more to the liking of a 
confirmed agnostic. I suppose I owe 
McCleary an apology — I should 
have known he would never have 
put himself in a position where he 
would have to teach freshmen all 
about learning: 

And, of course, I know who 
“He” is. Or rather, I know who He 
isn't, which is something else again. 
Surely, though, I can no longer 
think of Him as being human. 
Whether I should be consoled at 
this or not, I have no way of telling. 

I still have no notion of why I 
am here, however, nor why this 
alien chose to pick me of all people 
to pay a visit to His spaceship. What 
possible use could I be? Surely if 
He were interested in making con- 
tact with the human race, He would 
have spirited away a politician. Af- 
ter all, that’s what politicians are 
for! Since there has been no effort 
made to communicate with me, 
however, I must reluctantly give up 
any cherished hopes that His pur- 
pose is that of making contact with 
genus homo . 

Or perhaps He’s a galactic scien- 
tist of some kind, a biologist of 
sorts, out gathering specimens. 
Now, that’s a particularly nasty 
thought. What if He turned out to 
be a physiologist, interested in cut- 
ting me open eventually, to see 
what makes me tick? Will my in- 
nards be smeared over a glass slide 
for scores of youthful Hims to peer 
at under a microscope? Brrrr! I 
don’t mind giving my life to 
Science, but I’d rather do it a little 
at a time. 



If you don’t mind, I think I’ll go 
do a little repressing for a while. 

Good God! I should have known 
it! Destiny will play her little tricks, 
and all jokes have their cosmic 
angles. He is a psychologist! Had I 
given it due consideration, I would 
have realized that whenever you 
come across a new species, you 
worry about behavior first, physi- 
ology second. So I have received the 
ultimate insult — or the ultimate 
compliment. I don’t know which. I 
have become a specimen for an 
alien psychologist! 

This thought first occurred to me 
when I awoke after my latest sleep 
(which was filled, I must admit, 
with most frightening dreams). It 
was immediately obvious that some- 
thing about the room had changed. 
Almost as once I noticed that one 
of the walls now had a lever of 
some kind protruding from it, and 
to one side of the lever, a small hole 
in the wall with a container beneath 
the hole. I wandered over to the 
lever, inspected it a few moments, 
then accidentally depressed the 
thing. At once there came a loud 
clicking noise, and a protein ball 
popped out of the hole and fell into 
the container. 

For just a moment a frown 
crossed my brow. This seemed 
somehow so strangely familiar. 
Then, all at once, I burst into wild 
laughter. The room had been 
changed into a gigantic Skinner 
Box! For years I had been studying 
animal learning by putting white 
rats in a Skinner Box and following 
the changes in the rats’ behavior. 
The rats had to learn to press the 



LEARNING THEORY 



107 




lever in order to get a pellet of 
food, which was delivered to them 
through just such an apparatus as 
is now affixed to the wall of my cell. 
And now, after all of these years, 
and after all of the learning studies 
I had done, to find myself trapped 
like a rat in a Skinner Box! Perhaps 
this was hell after all, I told myself, 
and the Lord High Executioner’s 
admonition to “let the punishment 
fit the crime” was being followed. 

Frankly, this sudden turn of 
events has left me more than a little 
shaken. 



1 SEEM TO be performing ac- 
cording to theory. It didn’t take 
me long to discover that pressing 
the lever would give me food some 
of the time, while at other times all 
I got was the click and no protein 
ball. It appears that approximately 
every twelve hours the thing de- 
livers me a random number of pro- 
tein balls — the number has varied 
from five to fifteen so far. I never 
know ahead of time how many pel- 
lets — I mean protein balls — the 
apparatus will deliver, and it spews 
them out intermittently. Sometimes 
I have to press the lever a dozen 
times or so before it will give me 
anything, while at other times it 
gives me one ball for each press. 
Since I don’t have a watch on me, 
I am never quite sure when the 
twelve hours have passed, so I 
stomp over to the lever and press 
it every few minutes when I think 
it’s getting close to time to be fed. 
Just like my rats always did. And 
since the pellets are small and I 
never get enough of them, occa- 

108 



sionally I find myself banging away 
on the lever with all the compulsion 
of a stupid animal. But I missed the 
feeding time once and almost 
starved to death (so it seemed) be- 
fore the lever delivered food the 
next time. About the only consola- 
tion to my wounded pride is that 
at this rate of starvation, I’ll lose 
my bay window in short order. 

At least He doesn’t seem to be 
fattening me up for the kill. Or 
maybe he just likes lean meat! 

I have been promoted. Ap- 
parently He in His infinite alien 
wisdom has decided that I’m intelli- 
gent enough to handle the Skinner- 
type apparatus, so I’ve been pro- 
moted to solving a maze. Gan you 
picture the irony of the situation? 
All of the classic Learning Theory 
methodology is practically being 
thrown in my face. If only I could 
communicate with Him! I don’t 
mind being subjected to tests nearly 
as much as I mind being underesti- 
mated. Why, I can solve puzzles 
hundreds of times more complex 
than what He’s throwing at me. 
But how can I tell Him? 

As it turns out, the maze is much 
like our standard T-mazes, and is 
not too difficult to learn. It’s a 
rather long one, true, with some 23 
choice points along the way. I spent 
the better part of half an hour 
wandering through the thing the 
first time I found myself in it. Sur- 
prisingly enough, I didn’t realize 
the first time out what I was in, 
so I made no conscious attempt to 
memorize the correct turns. It 
wasn’t until I reached the final 
turn and found food waiting for 

JAMES MC CONNELL 




me that I recognized what I was 
expected to do. The next time 
through the maze my performance 
was a good deal better, and I was 
able to turn in a perfect per- 
formance in not too long a time. 
However, it does not do my ego any 
good to realize that my own white 
rats could have learned the maze 
a little sooner than I did. 

My “home cage,” so to speak, 
still has the Skinner apparatus in it, 
but the lever delivers food only oc- 
casionally now. I still give it a whirl 
now and again, but since I’m get- 
ting a fairly good supply of food at 
the end of the maze each time, I 
don’t pay the lever much attention. 

Now that I am very sure of what 
is happening to me, quite naturally 
my thoughts have turned to how I 
can get out of this situation. Mazes 
I can solve without too much diffi- 
culty, but how to escape apparently 
is beyond my intellectual capacity. 
But then, come to think of it, there 
was precious little chance for my 
own experimental animals to get 
out of my clutches. And assuming 
that I am unable to escape, what 
then? After He has finished putting 
me through as many paces as He 
wishes, where do we go from there? 
Will He treat me as I treated most 
of my non-human subjects — that is, 
will I get tossed into a jar contain- 
ing chloroform? “Following the 
experiment, the animals were sacri- 
ficed,” as we so euphemistically re- 
port in the scientific literature. This 
doesn’t appeal to me much, as you 
can imagine. Or maybe if I seem 
particularly bright to Him, He may 
use me for breeding purposes, to 
establish a colony of His own. Now, 

LEARNING THEORY 



that might have possibilities . 

Oh, damn Freud anyhow! 

And damn Him too! I had just 
gotten the maze well learned when 
He upped and changed things on 
me. I stumbled about like a bat in 
the sunlight for quite some time 
before I finally got to the goal box. 
I’m afraid my performance was 
pretty poor. What He did was just 
to reverse the whole maze so that 
it was a mirror image of what it 
used to be. Took me only two trials 
to discover the solution. Let Him 
figure that one out if He’s so smart! 

My performance on the maze re- 
versal must have pleased Him, be- 
cause now He’s added a new com- 
plication. And again I suppose I 
could have predicted the next step 
if I had been thinking along the 
right direction. I woke up a few 
hours ago to find myself in a totally 
different room. There was nothing 
whatsoever in the room, but oppo- 
site me were two doors in the wall 
— one door a pure white, the other 
jet black. Between me and the 
doors was a deep pit, filled with 
water. I didn’t like the looks of the 
situation, for it occured to me right 
away that He had devised a kind of 
jumping stand for me. I had to 
choose which of the doors was open 
and led to food. The other door 
would be locked. If I jumped at the 
wrong door, and found it locked, 
I’d fall in the water. I needed a 
bath, that was for sure, but I didn’t 
relish getting it in this fashion. 

While I stood there watching, I 
got the shock of my life. I meant it 
quite literally. The bastard had 

109 




thought of everything. When I used 
to run rats on jumping stands, to 
overcome their reluctance to jump, 
I used to shock them. He’s follow- 
ing exactly the same pattern. The 
floor in this room is wired but good. 
I howled and jumped about and 
showed all the usual anxiety be- 
havior. It took me less than two 
seconds to come to my senses and 
make a flying leap at the white 
door, however. 

You know something? That 
water is ice-cold! 



1 HAVE NOW, by my own cal- 
culations, solved no fewer than 
87 different problems on the jump- 
ing stand, and I’m getting sick and 
tired of it. Once I got angry and 
just pointed at the correct door — 
and got shocked for not going ahead 
and jumping. I shouted bloody 
murder, cursing Him at the top of 
my voice, telling Him if He didn’t 
like my performance, He could 
damn’ well lump it. All He did, of 
course, was to increase the shock. 

Frankly, I don’t know how much 
longer I can put up with this. It’s 
not that the work is difficult. If He 
were giving me half a chance to 
show my capabilities, I wouldn’t 
mind it. I suppose I’ve contem- 
plated a thousand different means 
of escaping, but none of them is 
worth mentioning. But if I don’t 
get out of here soon, I shall go stark 
raving mad! 

For almost an hour after it hap- 
pened, I sat in this room and just 
wept. I realize that it is not the 
style in our culture for a grown man 

110 



to weep, but there are times when 
cultural taboos must be forgotten. 
Again, had I thought much about 
the sort of experiments He must 
have had in mind, I most probably 
could have predicted the next step. 
Even so, I most likely would have 
repressed the knowledge. 

One of the standard problems 
which any learning psychologist is 
interested in is this one — will an 
animal learn something if you fail 
to reward him for his performance? 
There are many theorists, such as 
Hull and Spence, who believe that 
reward (or “reinforcement,” as 
they call it) is absolutely necessary 
for learning to occur. This is mere 
stuff and nonsense, as anyone with 
a grain of sense knows, but none- 
theless the “reinforcement” theory 
has been dominant in the field for 
years now. We fought a hard battle 
with Spence and Hull, and actually 
had them with their backs to the 
wall at one point, when suddenly 
they came up with the concept of 
“secondary reinforcement.” That is, 
anything associated with a reward 
takes on the ability to act as a 
reward itself. For example, the 
mere sight of food would become 
a reward in and of itself — almost 
as much a reward, in fact, as is the 
eating of the food. The sight of 
food, indeed! But nonetheless, it 
saved their theories for the moment. 

For the past five years now, I 
have been trying to design an ex- 
periment that would show beyond 
a shadow of a doubt that the sight 
of a reward was not sufficient for 
learning to take place. And now 
look at what has happened to me! 

I’m sure that He must lean to- 



JAMES MC CONNELL 




wards Hull and Spence in His 
theorizing, for earlier today, when 
I found myself in the jumping 
stand room, instead of being re- 
warded with my usual protein balls 
when I made the correct jump, I — 
I’m sorry, but it is difficult to write 
about even now. For when I made 
the correct jump and the door 
opened and I started towards the 
food trough, I found it had been 
replaced with a photograph. A 
calendar photograph. You know the 
one. Her name, I think, is Monroe. 

I sat on the floor and cried. For 
five whole years I have been at- 
tacking the validity of the secondary 
reinforcement theory, and now I 
find myself giving Him evidence 
that the theory is correct! For I 
cannot help “learning” which of the 
doors is the correct one to jump 
through. I refuse to stand on the 
apparatus and have the life shocked 
out of me, and I refuse to pick the 
wrong door all the time and get an 
icy bath time after time. It isn’t 
fair! For He will doubtless put it 
all down to the fact that the mere 
sight of the photograph is function- 
ing as a reward, and that I am 
learning the problems merely to 
be able to see Miss What’s-her- 
name in her bare skin ! 

I can just see Him now, sitting 
somewhere else in this spaceship, 
gathering in all the data I am giv- 
ing Him, plotting all kinds of learn- 
ing curves, chortling to Himself be- 
cause I am confirming all of His 
pet theories. I just wish . 

Almost an hour has gone by since 
I wrote the above section. It seems 
longer than that, but surely it’s been 

LEARNING THEORY 



only an hour. And I have spent the 
time deep in thought. For I have 
discovered a way out of this place, 
I think. The question is, dare I do 
it? 

I was in the midst of writing that 
paragraph about His sitting and 
chortling and confirming His 
theories, when it suddenly struck 
me that theories are born of the 
equipment that one uses. This has 
probably been true throughout the 
history of all science, but perhaps 
most true of all in psychology. If 
Skinner had never invented his 
blasted box, if the maze and the 
jumping stand had not been de- 
veloped, we probably would have 
entirely different theories of learn- 
ing today than we now have. For if 
nothing else, the type of equipment 
that one uses drastically reduces the 
type of behavior that one’s subjects 
can show, and one’s theories have 
to account only for the type of be- 
havior that appears in the labora- 
tories. 

It follows from this also that any 
two cultures that devise the same 
sort of experimental procedures will 
come up with almost identical 
theories. 

Keeping all of this in mind, it’s 
not hard for me to believe that He 
is an iron-clad reinforcement theo- 
rist, for He uses all of the various 
paraphernalia that they use, and 
uses it in exactly the same way. 

My means of escape is therefore 
obvious. He expects from me con- 
firmation of all His pet theories. 
Well, he won’t get it any more! I 
know all of His theories backwards 
and forwards, and this means I 
know how to give Him results that 

111 




will tear His theories right smack in 
half! 

I can almost predict the results. 
What does any learning theorist do 
with an animal that won’t behave 
properly, that refuses to give the 
results that are predicted? One gets 
rid of the beast, quite naturally. 
For one wishes to use only healthy, 
normal animals in one’s work, and 
any animal that gives “unusual” re- 
sults is removed from the study but 
quickly. After all, if it doesn’t per- 
form as expected, it must be sick, 
abnormal, or aberrant in one way 
or another . 

There is no guarantee, of course, 
what method He will employ to dis- 
pose of my now annoying presence. 
Will He “sacrifice” me? Or will He 
just return me to the “permanent 
colony”? I cannot say. I know only 
that I will be free from what is now 
an intolerable situation. 

Just wait until He looks at His 
results from now on! 

FROM: Experimenter-in-Chief, 

Interstellar Labship PSYCH- 145 
TO: Director, Bureau of Science 

Thlan, my friend, this will be an 
informal missive. I will send the 
official report along later, but I 
wanted to give you my subjective 
impressions first. 

The work with the newly dis- 
covered species is, for the moment, 
at a standstill. Things went exceed- 
ingly well at first. We picked what 
seemed to be a normal, healthy ani- 
mal and smattered it into our 
standard test apparatus. I may have 
told you that this new species 
seemed quite identical to our usual 
laboratory animals, so we included 



a couple of the “toys” that our 
home animals seem so fond of — thin 
pieces of material made from wood- 
pulp and a tiny stick of graphite. 
Imagine our surprise, and our 
pleasure, when this new specimen 
made exactly the same use of the 
materials as have all of our home 
colony specimens. Could it be that 
there are certain innate behavior 
patterns to be found throughout the 
universe in the lower species? 

Well, I merely pose the question. 
The answer is of little importance 
to a Learning Theorist. Your friend 
Verpk keeps insisting that the use 
of these “toys” may have some 
deeper meaning to it, and that per- 
haps we should investigate further. 
At his insistence, then, I include 
with this informal missive the 
materials used by our first subject. 
In my opinion, Verpk is guilty of 
gross anthropomorphism, and I 
wish to have nothing further to do 
with the question. However, this 
behavior did give us hope that our 
newly discovered colony would yield 
subjects whose performances would 
be exactly in accordance with 
standard theory. 

And, in truth, this is exactly what 
seemed to be the case. The animal 
solved the Bfian Box problem in 
short order, yielding as beautiful 
data has I have ever seen. We then 
shifted it to maze, maze-reversal 
and jumping stand problems, and 
the results could not have confirmed 
our theories better had we rigged 
the data. However, when we 
switched the animal to secondary 
reinforcement problems, it seemed 
to undergo a strange sort of change. 
No longer was its performance up 



112 



JAMES MC CONNELL 




to par. In fact, at times it seemed 
to go quite berserk. For part of the 
experiment, it would perform 
superbly. But then, just as it seemed 
to be solving whatever problem we 
set it to, its behavior would subtly 
change into patterns that obviously 
could not come from a normal 
specimen. It got worse and worse, 
until its behavior departed radically 
from that which our theories pre- 
dicted. Naturally, we knew then 
that something had happened to the 
animal, for our theories are based 
upon thousands of experiments with 
similar subjects, and hence our 
theories must be right. But our 
theories hold only for normal sub- 
jects, and for normal species, so it 
soon became apparent to us that we 
had stumbled upon some abnormal 
type of animal. 

Upon due consideration, we re- 
turned the subject to its home 
colony. However, we also voted al- 
most unanimously to request from 
you permission to take steps to 
destroy the complete colony. It is 
obviously of little scientific use to 
us, and stands as a potential danger 
that we must take adequate steps 
against. Since all colonies are under 
your protection, we therefore re- 



quest permission to destroy it. 

I must report, by the way, that 
Verpk’s vote was the only one which 
was cast against this procedure. He 
has some silly notion that one 
should study behavior as one finds 
it. Frankly, I cannot understand 
why you have seen fit to saddle me 
with him on this expedition, but 
perhaps you have your reasons. 

Verpk’s vote notwithstanding, 
however, the rest of us are of the 
considered opinion that this whole 
new colony must be destroyed, and 
quickly. For it is obviously diseased 
or some such — as reference to our 
theories has proven. And should it 
by some chance come in contact 
with our other colonies, and infect 
our other animals with whatever 
disease or aberration it has, we 
would never be able to predict their 
behavior again. I need not carry the 
argument further, I think. 

May we have your permission to 
destroy the colony as soon as possi- 
ble, then, so that we may search out 
yet other colonies and test our 
theories against other healthy ani- 
mals? For it is only in this fashion 
that science progresses. 

Respectfully yours,

ROUTINE EMERGENCY 



I ’M STRICTLY A shovel man in 
this life we have here. I’m a 
worker, not a leisure-crowded man 
BY with a zip-car who can use these 

big roads the way they were meant 
DAVID R. BUNCH to be used. I’m a clearance man. 




Been in some phase of that work 
for about fifty years. And I’d say 
we’re a helluva lot more efficient at 
it today than we used to be. It’s not 
so much new methods, though that 
helps, as it is a state of mind. The 
way you look at a thing is the de- 
ciding vote on almost any question, 
don’t you think? 

Well, we used to lay ’em all out 
nice and straight, and take some of 
’em in if we thought they had a 
chance, and patch up the rig if 
possible, and take down numbers 
and names and make a man-sized 
incident of the whole proceedings. 
As you can see, that took time, was 
inefficient, and held up the arterial 
flow, as you might say, a good deal. 
Now, what do we do today? Say, 
just let me give you a run-down on 
a little job we had this morning, 
and maybe that’ll explain the serv- 
ice. As I said before, my job is 
clearance. Without me these record 
traffic flow movements we have to- 
day wouldn’t be possible, and ex- 
cuse me, I’m not bragging. Sure, 
I’m proud of my job, just as a 
plumber might be, or any other 
honest union worker who’s dealing 
in an important commodity or serv- 
ice and doing it right and getting 
honest pay, and not having to strain 
to do it. I guess you might say my 
commodity is speed. My job is clear- 
ance, as I believe I said before. 

Anyway we were sitting around 
the station this morning, the on- 
crew was, watching the board, play- 
ing the usual cards, passing the 
usual ribs, swapping the usual tales. 
The off -crew was upstairs sponging 
their boots, cleaning up, getting 
ready for prayers and bed. Things 



had hardly settled down when the 
board came up with our number 
and the spot we were to go to. 
We weren’t excited like those fire- 
men are expected to get everytime, 
because the board comes up with 
our number, on the average, about 
twenty-five times a day. And you 
just don’t get excited about your 
work that many times a day, day- 
in-day-out, unless you’re crazy. We 
loaded into the big yellow clearance 
rig, which is about the most efficient 
vehicle of its kind yet devised, and 
fed it the position we were expected 
to go to. When we press the right 
numbers and road names, a spot of 
light formed in the brains of the 
vehicle and soon appears on a sen- 
sitized map of the county where we 
operate. That spot of light marks 
the position of our job. And since 
all the alarms were already on out 
there automatically, our rig would 
home in on the sound without a 
bit of trouble. 

I may as well tell you now we 
call our rig Big Soup. Now don’t 
get the idea we’re sentimental in 
our crews, but still it just seems 
natural to name our rigs, since 
we’re with them so much, and I 
guess we do get attached to them, 
like a crew for a ship, sort of. Well, 
the Big Soup went on out this 
morning in a most routine way, and 
we were all feeling routine and sort 
of yawnish, because it was rather 
early, and we’d had a very hard day 
yesterday. A lot of calls, I mean. 
When we pulled up to the spot, it 
looked like a very usual job, and it 
was, except for one thing that made 
it a little unusual, but not very un- 
usual, and I’ll tell you about that 




after awhile, if I don’t forget it. 

I let down the front end take- 
ups, Jug let down the rear end take- 
ups, and Tanks and John were each 
operating one of the sides. Jake, the 
senior clearance man, was holding 
Big Soup on to the spot and mov- 
ing her a little whenever necessary 
to do the job. You see, we’re a 
standard five-man crew. And Big 
Soup looked something like a great 
ripe pumpkin now laid down in 
four sections on the highway, with 
a big pot in the middle brewing the 
stew. The four sections probing out 
over the pavement and feeling 
along the embankments were like 
big vacuum cleaners whisking what- 
ever loose things they came in con- 
tact with into the pot. 

After awhile we had the job 
cleaned up except for a little shovel 
work caused by rough ground af- 
fecting the efficiency of the take- 
ups, and we all helped on that, even 
Jake, who I’d say is about the best 
crew leader I’ve ever worked with. 
We cleaned things all up fine, sec- 
tioned the Big Soup up into her 
usual globe-on-wheels condition, 
and then came on back to sponge 
our boots, and watch the board be- 
tween jobs, and play a little cards, 
naturally. Oh, we horsed around a 
bit too, you know the way a close- 
knit crew will. Kidded each other 
about our work, our wives, big 
taxes, mothers-in-law, etc. And 
Jake, of course, had to make out 
the reports according to the num- 
ber plates involved and notify the 
people most concerned and have 
the cups for the burial ready when 
they should arrive. And he had to 
have the contents of Big Soup as- 



sayed for metal and make a report 
on that before it could be dumped 
in the unit mix for shipment to the 
big steel mills. I’ll say right now 
I wouldn’t be a crew leader for the 
little extra that’s in it, though I will 
say I’m pretty proud of my work 
and I think it’s important what I’m 
doing to keep the big roads clear. 

And now you want to know what 
was unusual about this job this 
morning, but not very unusual, that 
I said I’d tell you about if I didn’t 
forget it. Well, it was about a burial 
cup. You see, in our work we just 
melt everything together as we go, 
don’t have time for anything else 
you might say, and just dip out a 
cup of the mixture for decent burial 
when required. Usually we only 
dip two cups, one to each of the 
next-of-kin of the two parties in- 
volved. But I have seen instances, 
in these multiple affairs, usually 
caused by fog, where we might have 
to dip as many as twenty cups, and 
that takes steel! Because it’s mostly 
metal, after all, the way we do it. 
I suppose it is a comfort to the 
bereaved to know that the old de- 
cencies have at least been nodded 
at. — But I do run on. — You see, 
when one party, a woman, came 
for the burial cup this morning she 
just accepted it in the usual way 
and said she’d see to it that friend 
husband got a decent plot, which 
was, she said, the very least she 
could do, though God knew when 
she would ever be able to afford 
another zip-car. But the other party, 
a man, put up quite a fuss when he 
came for his cup, because we’d 
slouched our job, he said. Seems his 
wife’s old lady, his mother-in-law 



116 



DAVID R. BUNCH 




you might say, at the incident had 
somehow got over an embankment 
and out into a cornfield and had 
struggled home with only a broken 
hip to show for it. He wanted to 
know if we wanted to come after 
her, since by rights he felt that she 
should have been vacuumed up too 
and in the soup, since she was out 
there cluttering up the arteries, or 
had been. But we said gosh no! we 
couldn’t do that, it wasn’t any part 
of our job to do that, though if 
she’d been in the way at the time of 
the clean-up we’d certainly have 
vacuumed her. We finally convinced 



him he should take his cup of the 
wife and kids and the family zip- 
car on home for decent burial and 
quit such unseemly fuss. 

As you can see, we can’t afford to 
get mixed up in any family senti- 
ment in our job. And most people 
don’t expect it nowadays anyway. 
Our job is just to vacuum up the 
bodies and broken zip-cars as fast as 
we can after a wreck on the high- 
way and keep the big lanes clear. 
It’s a fair job, we got a union, and 
it’s considered priority work. Heck, 
the young guys even get deferred in 
it in time of war. END

into action. “But I’m not.” 

A new thought struck him. “The 
Rumanian — Grigorescu. Was he 
part of the illusion too?” 

“No,” Hadafield said. The esper 
glanced up. “He’s real. He was just 
playing along; he knew what was 
going on here.” 

“Rumania’s free,” Nourse said. 
“We’ve been in contact with them 
for months, through Hadafield. We 
can hide there, for a while. We’re 
building a video transmitter in 
Canada, and we hope to relay our 
programs through all of America. 
The barriers are going to come 
down, John. It may take ten years, 
but it’ll happen— and there’ll be a 
free and united world once again. 
The first blow was struck tonight 
The people saw our show; they’re 
reading our handbills. They’re start- 
ing to wonder.” 

ROUTINE EMERGENCY 



Amory stood up. He was a trifle 
unsteady on his legs. “Maybe,” he 
said, “we’ll need to bring Cargh 
back some day— to stun the world 
into action. We may need to trump 
up a common enemy to unite us all. 
I hope not, though.” 

He shook his head. “But now 
we’ll have to hide. We can’t stay 
here. Security’ll be on our tails any 
minute.” 

“Did they follow you here?” 
Nourse asked. 

“Yes. But the local banditti ex- 
terminated them.” 

The whirring of a copter’s vanes 
was audible overhead. “Here’s Ky- 
man,” Beckett said. “We can leave 
now. And in three days we’ll be in 
Europe.” 

Amory nodded. “Yes,” he said. 
“But we’ll be coming back.” END

SECU RITY 

(Continued from page 101) 

Lewis jumped under the wheel of 
the jeep, slammed it into gear and 
they headed down the concrete 
strip and straight for the gap in the 
fence. 

“What happened to Cardoza?” 
Lewis asked. 

Brogarth said from the back seat, 
“He said he didn’t want to be 
labeled a security risk and be exe- 
cuted for sabotage.” 

Nemerov was drunk and he kept 
mumbling incoherently, and some- 
times giving out with bits and pieces 
of half remembered poetry. 

About a mile out in the sand and 
next to a wall of sandstone, they 
waited for any signs of pursuit. 
There were none. They rested there 
until morning, only an hour and a 
half away, and when they looked 
back toward the location of the 
Project, they could see nothing that 
looked any different from sand, 
brush, rocks and red sandstone. 

“Perfect camouflage,” Nemerov 
said as the jeep started up again. 
“You could walk within fifty feet of 
that fence and never know there 
was any Project there.” 

Later a hot wind came up and 
they ran into the Monster lying 
dead on its face with dust devils 
dancing over it. 

An old prospector leading a bur- 
ro came around the wall of sand- 
stone and looked at the Monster, 
then at the occupants of the jeep. 

“Howdy, folks,” he said. 

“Hello,” Lewis said. “We’re lost. 
Where are we and which way do 

118 



we go to get to civilization?” 

“What’s that thing?” the pros- 
pector asked, looking at the Mon- 
ster. 

“A scientific experiment that was 
never finished,” Lewis said. 

“What I figured,” the prospector 
said. “You scientists out here al- 
ways up to something.” He pointed 
to the right. “Keep going that way 
and you’ll find a narrow road. Fol- 
low it and you’ll hit the middle of 
the valley and a highway right into 
the Chocolate Mountains.” 

Lewis knew where he was. The 
Chocolate Mountains walled off the 
rushing Colorado River from the 
Imperial Valley and Los Angeles 
farther on. 

“Thanks,” Lewis said. 

“How’s the war going these 
days?” Betty asked. 

The prospector scratched his 
head and replaced his felt hat. He 
looked at them oddly. 

“You must have been holed up in 
the hills a long time, Miss. There 
ain’t been any war for two years. 
They started one, but the first 
couple of days scared everybody too 
much and they called the whole 
thing off. Where you folks been 
anyways, to the Moon?” 

“Practically,” Lewis said. 

As the jeep moved away, Nem- 
erov turned and looked back at 
the Monster and the old prospector 
who still stood there gazing at it. 

“ ‘My name,’ ” Nemerov said, 
“ ‘is Ozymandias, King of Kings. 
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and 
despair. Round the decay of that 
colossal wreck, boundless and bare 
the lone and level sands stretch far 
away.’ ” E N D 





I just read Dave E. Fisher’s amus- 
ing story entitled THE BIRDS 
AND THE BEES in a recent issue 
of IF and — see here, I’m tired of 
that stupid phrase, “the birds and 
the bees” which is supposed to rep- 
resent “the facts of life” or the be- 
ginnings of the sex instruction of 
the young. There was a picture of 
the same title recently starring 
George Gobel and there are con- 
stant references to the birds and 
bees on TV and in print. 

Well for heaven’s sake, has any- 
one ever tried to explain sex by talk- 
ing about the birds and the bees? 
What have the birds and the bees 
to do with it? 

IT’S THE BEES AND THE 
FLOWERS. Will you get that 
through your head? IT’S THE 
BEES AND THE FLOWERS. 

The bee travels to one flower and 
picks up pollen from the stamens. 
The pollen contains the male sex 

11 



cells of the plant. The bee then 
travels to another flower (of the 
same species) and the pollen 
brushes off onto the pistil, which 
contains the female sex cells of the 
plant. The pollen particle sends a 
process down the length of the pis- 
til and eventually the male sex cell 
and the female sex cell unite to 
form a fertilized cell which devel- 
opes into a seed and, eventually, 
into a new plant (of the same spe- 
cies) . 

Now in the human being the male 
cells must also be brought into con- 
tact with the female sex cell, but we 
don’t rely on bees to do it for us. 
However, I will leave out the gory 
details, even though the poor simps 
who think the birds and the bees 
have something to do with it need 
the instruction badly. 

And what’s this about “Y’s” arti- 
cle on guided missiles? For years 
now, the United States has been 
calling for international inspection 
on armaments and the Soviet Union 
has been refusing. Do you mean 
that the Soviet Union has been right 
all along and that we have been 
foolish or hypocritical or both? 
Good heavens, I find this unset- 
tling. 

— Isaac Asimov 
Boston, Mass. 

Neither fools nor hypocrites Isaac . 
“Y” points out that it's so darned 
easy to hide them and change them 
from peaceful to warlike purposes , 
that ostensibly we'd not have any 
proof that all armaments were be- 
ing inspected , nor that the peaceful 
ones we were allowed to see 
wouldn't be turned against us.

Among science fiction writers it is 
generally accepted that interstellar 
travel by hyperspatial shortcuts is 
possible because distances are a lot 
less that way. On closer inspection 
this sounds like circular reasoning 
— which it is — but I have never 
read a story with an explanation of 
the theory behind hyperspatial in- 
terstellar travel, which didn’t, in 
the final analysis, boil down to the 
one just mentioned. Some writers, I 
admit, explain that our space is so 
kinky that it is possible to travel be- 
tween points light-years apart by 
only going nominal distances in hy- 
perspace; but that still doesn’t ex- 
plain the kinks. 

Now I suggest that although it is 
impossible for anything to travel 
any distance in ordinary space with- 
out diminution of intensity and the

passage of time. Thought can and 
does do it. Since the intensity of 
parapsychological phenomena is 
completely independent of the dis- 
tance between cause and effect. 
Thought must travel through the 
kinks of hyperspace. And if thought 
can do it, why not interstellar 
spaceships? 

At least that’s as close as I can 
get to explaining this neat little 
trick that authors never quite do ex- 
plain. 

— A. D. Barnhart 
Cleveland, Ohio 

I’m pretty sick of the time ma- 
chine. All the mechanical devices 
etc. that authors dream up as a 
gimmick seem to require enormous 
flows of energy, plenty of electronic 
gadgetry etc., all of which leads the 
poor slob who invents it into some 
sort of trouble. Now I find that the 
time machine I carry around on my 
shoulders (and I have been carry- 
ing it for some “time” now) func- 
tions with the small amount of 
energy contained in three square 
meals a day. It seems to require no 
more energy for me to “go back” 
twenty years in time than it requires 
to “go back” twenty minutes; this 
movement seems to be instantaneous 
and without effort. It is my consid- 
ered opinion that the more stories 
and articles that are written about 
time travel, the longer it will take 
for the public to realize that their 
own minds are the only time ma- 
chines that they will ever know, or 
that will ever be known.
