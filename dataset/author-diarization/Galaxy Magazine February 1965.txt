"-phe astronomer Fred Hoyle, 
A for whom the undersigned 
has shared with many other 
science-fiction fans a very special 
interest (see Algis Budrys’s col- 
umn in this issue), has always 
struck us as A Man to Keep an 
Eye On. You never know what 
he is going to come up with next. 
He not only thinks like a science- 
fiction writer; he even writes like 
a science-fiction writer. He 
writes, in fact, both science-fic- 
tion ( The Black Cloud, Ossian’s 
Ride, etc.) and now the sort of 
extrapolative not-quite-fact that 
is sometimes called “non-fiction 
science fiction”. 

No doubt the sort of thing that 
Fred Hoyle will ultimately be 
measured by is whether some of 
his grander attempts to explain 
the beginnings of everything, 
such as his Steady-State theory 
of the permanent process of crea- 
tion of matter and the revision of 
Einstein’s laws he proposed a few 
months ago in London, turn out 
to meet the tests of prediction 
and observation. In a way, this is 
a pity. He is doing something 
quite apart from those things, 



and doing it very well. He is 
writing books like Of Men and 
Galaxies, just published by the 
University of Washington Press. 

Says Hoyle: “My experience 
with scientific problems, in par- 
ticular those in astronomy, is that 
where alternative possibilities 
exist it is never the possibility 
that leads to a dead end, the pos- 
sibil’ty that lacks interesting con- 
sequences, that turns out to be 
correct. It seems to be an over- 
riding feature of all physical laws 
that they become more elegant, 
simpler in a way, as we get to 
know them better, but that their 
consequences become more var- 
ied and complex.” This is 
“science-fiction writer thinking” 
if we ever heard any — imagine 
choosing among alternative as- 
trophysical theories on the basis 
of which one is going to be the 
most fun — and what makes it 
most dear to our hearts is that, 
for Fred Hoyle at least, it clearly 
works. 

Interesting book. Interesting 
man. Wonder how we can go 
about getting him to write for

BY CORDWAINER SMITH 

ILLUSTRATED BY FINLAY 



Underpeople can't give orders to humans. 
But this girl was not only an underperson 
— she was immensely , frighteningly more! 



I 

U A t two seventy-five in the 
morning,” said the Ad- 
ministrator to Casher O’Neill, 
“you will kill this girl with a 
knife. At two seventy-seven, a 
fast ground car will pick you up 
and bring you back here. Then 
the power cruiser will be yours. 
Is that a deal?” 



He held out his hand as if he 
wanted Casher O’Neill to shake 
it then and there, making some 
kind of an oath or bargain. 

Casher did not slight the man, 
so he picked up his glass and 
said, “Let’s drink to the deal 
first.” 

The Administrator’s quick, 
restless, darting eyes looked 
Casher up and down very sus- 



piciously. The warm sea-wet air 
blew through the room. The Ad- 
ministrator seemed wary, sus- 
picious, alert, but underneath his 
slight hostility there was another 
emotion, of which Casher could 
perceive just the edge. Fatigue 
with its roots in bottomless des- 
pair? Despair set deep in irre- 
coverable fatigue? 

That other emotion, which 
Casher could barely discern, was 
very strange indeed. On all his 
voyages back and forth through 
the inhabited worlds, Casher had 
met many odd types of men and 
women. He had never seen any- 
thing like this Administrator be- 
fore — brilliant, erratic, boastful. 
His title was “Mr. Commission- 
er” and he was an ex-Lord of 
the Instrumentality. 

HT'hough no longer a Lord, he 
* nevertheless represented the 
Instrumentality on this planet of 
Henriada, where the population 
had dropped from six hundred 
million persons down to some 
forty thousand. Indeed, local 
government had disappeared into 
limbo and this odd man, with 
the title of “Administrator”, was 
the only law and cavil authority 
which the planet knew. 

Nevertheless, he had a surplus 
power cruiser and Casher O’Neill 
was determined to get that 
cruiser as a part of his long plot 
to return to his home planet of 



Mizzer and to unseat the usurp- 
er, Colonel Wedder. 

, T v he Administrator stared 
sharply, wearily at Casher 
and then he, too, lifted his glass. 
The green twilight colored his 
liquor and made it seem like 
some strange poison. It was only 
Earth-byegarr, though a little on 
the strong side. 

With a sip, only a sip, the 
older man relaxed a little. “You 
may be out to trick me, young 
man. You may think I am an old 
fool running an abandoned plan- 
et. You may even be thinking 
that killing this girl is some kind 
of a crime. It is not a crime at 
alL I am the Administrator of 
Henriada and I have ordered 
that girl killed every year for 
the last eighty years. She isn’t 
even a girl, to start with. Just 
an underperson. Some kind of 
an animal turned into a domes- 
tic servant I can appoint you a 
deputy sheriff, if you like. Or 
chief of detectives. That might 
be tetter. I haven't had a chief 
erf detectives for a hundred years 
and more. You are my chief of 
detectives. Go in tomorrow. The 
house is not hard to find. It’s 
the biggest and best house left 
on this planet. Go in tomorrow 
morning. Ask for her master and 
be sure that you use the correct 
title, ‘Mister and Owner Murray 
Madigan.’ The robots will tell 



ON THE STORM PLANET 



7 



you to keep out. If you persist, 
she will come to the door. That’s 
when you will stab her through 
the heart, right there in the 
doorway. My ground car will 
race up one metric minute later. 
You jump in and come back 
here We’ve been through this 
before. Why don’t you agree? 
Don't you know who I am?” 

“I know perfectly _well,” smil- 
ed Casher O’Neill, “who you 
are, Mr. Commissioner and Ad- 
ministrator. You are the honor- 
able Rankin Meiklejohn, once 
of Earth Two. After all, the In- 
strumentality itself gave me a 
permit to land on this planet 
on private business. They knew 
who I was, too, and what I want- 
ed. There’s something funny 
about all this. Why should you 
give me a power cruiser — the 
best ship, you yourself say, in 
your whole fleet — just for kill- 
ing one modified animal which 
looks and talks like a girl? Why 
me? Why the visitor? Why the 
man from off- world? Why should 
you care whether this particular 
underperson is killed or not? If 
you’ve given the order for her 
death eighty times in eighty 
years, why hasn’t it been carried 
out long ago? Mind you, Mr. 
Administrator, I’m not saying no. 
I want that cruiser very much 
indeed. But what’s the deal? 
What’s the trick? Is it the house 
you want?” 



“Beauregard? No, I don’t 
want Beauregard. Old Madigan 
can rot in it for all I care. It’s 
between Ambiloxi and Mottile, 
on the Gulf of Esperanza. You 
can’t miss it. The road is good. 
You could drive yourself there.” 

“What is it, then?” Casher’s 
voice had an edge of persistence 
to it. 

Hjphe Administrator’s response 
was singular indeed. He fill- 
ed his huge inhaler-glass with 
the potent byegarr. He stared 
over the full glass at Casher 
O’Neil) as if he were an enemy. 
He drained the glass. Casher 
knew that that much liquor, tak- 
en suddenly, could kill the nor- 
mal human being. 

The Administrator did not fall 
over dead. 

He did not even become no- 
ticeably more drunk. 

His face turned red and his 
eyes almost popped out, as the 
harsh 160-proof liquor took ef- 
fect, but he still did not say 
anything. He just stared at 
Casher. Casher, who had learned 
in his long exile to play many 
games, just stared back. 

The Administrator broke first. 

He leaned forward and burst 
into a birdlike shriek of laughter. 
The laughter went on and on 
until it seemed that the man had 
hogged all the merriment in the 
galaxy. Casher snorted a little 



GALAXY 



laugh along with the man, more 
out of nervous reflex than any- 
thing else, but he waited for the 
Administrator to stop laughing. 

The Administrator finally got 
control of himself. With a broad 
grin and a wink at Casher, he 
poured four fingers more of the 
byegarr into his glass, drank it 
down as if it were a sip of cream, 
and then — only very lightly un- 
steady — stood up, came over 
and patted Casher on the shoul- 
der. 

"You’re a smart boy, my lad. 
I’m cheating you. I don’t care 
whether the power cruiser is 
there or not. I’m giving you 
something which has no value 
at all to me. Who’s ever going 
to take a power cruiser off this 
planet? It’s ruined. It’s aban- 
doned. And so am I. Go ahead, 
you can have the cruiser for 
nothing. Just take it, free. Un- 
conditionally.” 

This time it was Casher who 
leaped to his feet and stared 
down into the face of the fever- 
ish, wanton little man. 

“Thank you, Mr. Administra- 
tor!” he cried, trying to catch the 
hand of the Administrator to 
seal the deal. 

Rankin Meiklejohn looked aw- 
fully sober for a man with that 
much liquor in him. He held his 
right hand behind his back and 
would not shake. 

“You can have the cruiser all 



right. But kill that girl first! 
Just as a favor to me.” 

“Why?” said Casher, his voice 
loud and cold, trying to wring 
some sense out of the chattering 
man. 

“Just — just — just because I 
say so,” stammered the Admini- 
strator. 

“Why?” said Casher, cold and 
loud again. 

Hphe liquor suddenly took over 
inside the Administrator. He 
groped back for the arm of his 
chair, sat down suddenly and 
then looked up at Casher. He 
was very drunk indeed. The 
strange emotion, the elusive fa- 
tigue-despair, had vanished from 
his face. He spoke straightfor- 
wardly. Only the excessive care 
of his articulation would have 
shown a passer-by that he was 
drunk. 

“Because, you fool,” said Mei- 
klejohn, “those people, more 
than eighty in eighty years, that 
I have sent to Beauregard with 
orders to kill the girl. Those peo- 
ple — ” he repeated, and stop- 
ped speaking, clamping his lips 
together. 

“What happened to them?” 
asked Casher calmly. 

The Administrator grinned. “I 
don’t know what happened,” said 
tiie Administrator. “For the life 
of me, I don’t know. Not one of 
them ever came back.” 



10 



GALAXY 



“What happened to them? Did 
she kill them?” cried Casher. 

“How would I know?” said 
the drunken man, getting visibly 
more sleepy. 

“Why didn’t you report it?” 
This seemed to rouse the Ad- 
ministrator. “Report that one 
little girl had stopped me, the 
planetary Administrator? Just 
one little girl, and not even a 
human being! They would have 
sent help, and laughed at me. By 
the Bell, young man. I’ve been 
laughed at enough! i need no 
help from outside. You’re going 
in there tomorrow morning at 
two seventy-five, with a knife. 
And a ground car waiting.” 

He stared fixedly at Casher 
and then suddenly fell asleep in 
his chair. Casher called to the 
robots to show him to his room; 
they tended to the master as 
well. 

II 

r I 'he next morning at two sev- 
-*• enty-five sharp, nothing 
happened. Casher walked down 
the baroque corridor, looking into 
beautiful barren rooms. All the 
doors were open. 

Through one door he heard a 
sick, deep bubbling snore. 

It was the Administrator, sure 
enough. He lay twisted in his 
bed. A small nursing machine 
beside him, her white enameled 



body only slightly rusty. She 
held up a mechanical hand for 
silence and somehow managed 
to make the gesture seem light, 
delicate and pretty, even from 
a machine. 

Casher walked lightly back to 
his own room, where he ordered 
hotcakes, bacon and coffee. He 
studied a tornado through the 
armored glass of his window 
while the robots prepared his 
food. The elastic trees clung to 
the earth with a fury which 
matched the fury of the wind. 
The trunk of the tornado reach- 
ed like the nose of a mad ele- 
phant down into the gardens, 
but the flora fought back. A few 
animals whipped upward and 
out of sight. The tornado then 
came straight for the house, but 
did not damage it outside of 
making a lot of noise. 

“We have two or three hun- 
dred of those a day,” said a but- 
ler robot. “That is why we store 
all spacecraft underground and 
have no weather machines. It 
would cost more, the people said, 
to make this planet livable than 
the planet could possibly yield. 
The radio and news are in the 
library, sir. I do not think that 
the honorable Rankin Meikle- 
jolin will wake until evening, 
say seven-fifty or eight o’clock.” 

“Can I go out?” 

“Why not, sir? You are a true 
man. You do what you wish.” 



ON THE STORM PLANET 



11 



“I mean, is it safe for me to 
go out?” 

“Oh, no, sir! The wind would 
tear you apart or carry you 
away.” 

“Don’t people ever go out?” 

“Yes, sir. With ground cars 
or with automatic body armor. 
I have been told that if it weighs 
fifty tons or better, the person 
inside is safe. I would not know, 
sir. As you see, I am a robot. I 
was made here, though my brain 
was formed on Earth Two. I 
have never been outside this 
house.” 

Casher looked at the robot. 
This one seemed unusually talk- 
ative. He chanced the opportuni- 
ty of getting some information. 

“Have you ever heard of 
Beauregard?” 

“Yes, sir. It is the best house 
on this planet. I have heard 
people say that it is the solidest 
building on Henriada. It belongs 
to the Mister and Owner Murray 
Madigan. He is an Old North 
Australian, a renunciant who left 
his home planet and came here 
when Henriada was, a busy 
world. He brought all his wealth 
with him. The underpeople and 
robots say that it is a wonderful 
place on the inside.” 

“Have you seen it?” 

“Oh, no, sir, I have never left 
this building.” 

“Does the man Madigan ever 
come here?” 



The robot seemed to be trying 
to laugh, but did not succeed. 
He answered, very unevenly, 
“Oh, no, sir. He never goes any- 
where.” 

“Can you tell me anything 
about the female who lives with 
him?” 

“No, sir,” said the robot. 

“Do you know anything about 
her?” 

“Sir, it is not that. I know a 
great deal about her.” 

“Why can’t you talk about 
her, then?” 

“I have been commanded not 
to, sir.” 

“I am,” said Casher O’Neill, 
“a true human being. I here- 
with countermand those orders. 
Tell me about her.” 

The robot’s voice became for- 
mal and cold. “The orders can- 
not be countermanded, sir.” 

“Why not?” snapped Casher. 
“Are they the Administrator’s?” 

“No, sir.” 

“Whose, then?” 

“Hers,” said the robot softly, 
and left the room. 

/'-'lasher O’Neill spent the rest 
^ 1 of the day trying to get in- 
formation; he obtained very lit- 
tle. 

The Deputy Administrator was 
a young man who hated his 
chief. 

When Casher, who dined with 
him, the two of them having a 



12 



GALAXY 



poorly cooked state luncheon in 
a dining room which would have 
seated five hundred people, tried 
to come to the point by asking 
bluntly, “What do you know 
about Murray Madigan?”, he 
got an answer which was blunt 
to the point of incivility. 

“Nothing.” 

“You never heard of him?” 
cried Casher. 

“Keep your troubles to your- 
self, mister visitor,” said the 
Deputy Administrator. “I’ve got 
to stay on this planet long 
enough to get promoted off. You 
can leave. You shouldn’t have 
come.” 

“I have,” said Casher, “an 
all-world pass from the Instru- 
mentality.” 

“All right,” said the young 
man, “that shows that you are 
more important than I am. Let’s 
not discuss the matter. Do you 
like your lunch?” 

Casher had learned diplomacy 
in his childhood, when he was 
the heir apparent to the Dicta- 
torship of Mizzer. When his hor- 
rible uncle, Kuraf, lost the ruler- 
ship, Casher had approved of 
the coup by the Colonels Wed- 
der and Gibna, but now Wedder 
was supreme and enforcing a 
period of terror and virtue. Cash- 
er thus knew courts and cere- 
mony, big talk and small talk, 
and on this occasion he let the 
small talk do. The young De- 



puty Administrator had only out 
ambition, to get off the planet 
Henriada and never to see or 
hear of Rankin Meiklejohn 
again. 

Casher could understand the 
point. 

Only one curious thing hap- 
pened during dinner. 

Toward the end, Casher slip- 
ped in the question, very infor- 
mally: “Can underpeople give 
orders to robots?” 

“Of course,” said the young 
man. “That’s one of the reasons 
we use underpeople. They have 
more initiative. They amplify 
our orders to robots on many 
occasions.” 

Casher smiled. “I didn’t mean 
it quite that way. Could an un- 
derperson give an order to a 
robot which a real human being 
could not then countermand?” 

The young man started to 
answer, even though his mouth 
was full of food. He was not a 
very polished young man. Sud- 
denly he stopped chewing and 
his eyes grew wide. Then, with 
his mouth half full, he said: 

“You are trying to talk about 
this planet, I guess. You can’t 
help it. You’re on the track. Stay 
on the track, then. Maybe you 
will get out of it alive. I refuse 
to get mixed up with it, with 
you, with him and his hateful 
schemes. All I want to do is to 
leave when my time comes.” 



ON THE STORM PLANET 



13 



The young man resumed 
chewing, his eyes steadfastly on 
his plate. 

T>efore Casher could pass off 
the matter by making some 
casual remark, the butler robot 
stopped behind him and leaned 
over. 

“Honorable sir, I heard your 
question. May I answer it?” 

“Of course,” said Casher, soft- 
ly- 

“The answer, sir,” said the 
butler-robot, softly but clearly, 
“to your question is no, no, never. 
That is the general rule of the 
civilized worlds. But on this 
planet of Henriada, sir, the an- 
swer is yes.” 

“Why?” said Casher. 

“It is my duty, sir,” said the 
robot butler, “to recommend to 
you this dish of fresh artichokes 
I am not authorized to deal with 
other matters.” 

“Thank you,” said Casher, 
straining to keep himself lot' mg 
imperturbable. 

Nothing much happened that 
night, except that Meiklejohn got 
up long enough to get drunk all 
over again. Though he invited 
Casher to come and drink with 
him, he never seriously discuss- 
ed the girl except for one out- 
burst. 

“Leave it till tomorrow. Fair 
and square. Open and above- 
board. Frank and honest. That’s 



me. I’ll take you around Beau- 
regard myself. You’ll see it’s 
easy. A knife, eh? A travelled 
young man like you would know 
what to do with a knife. And a 
little girl, too. Not very big. 
Easy job. Don’t give it another 
thought. Would you like some 
apple juice in your byegarr?” 

Casher had taken three con- 
traintoxicant pills before going 
to drink with the ex-Lord, but 
even at that he could not keep 
up with Meiklejohn. He accept- 
ed the dilution of apple juice 
gravely, gracefully and grate- 
fully. 

The little tornadoes stamped 
around the house. Meiklejohn, 
now launched into some drunken 
story of ancient injustices which 
had been done to him on other 
worlds, paid no attention to 
them. In the middle of the night, 
past nine-fifty in the evening, 
Casher woke alone in his chair, 
very stiff and uncomfortable. 
The robots must have had stand- 
ing instructions concerning the 
Administrator, and had appar- 
ently taken him off to bed. Cash- 
er walked wearily to his own 
room, cursed the thundering ceil- 
ing and went to sleep again. 

Ill 

nphe next day was very differ- 
ent indeed. 

The Administrator was as sob- 



14 



GALAXY 



er, brisk and charming as if he 
had never taken a drink in his 
life. 

He had the robots call Casher 
to join him at breakfast and said, 
by way of greeting, “I’ll wager 
you thought I was drunk last 
night.” 

“Well . said Casher. 

“Planet fever, that’s what it 
was. Planet fever. A bit of al- 
cohol keeps it from developing 
too far. Let’s see. It’s three-sixty 
now. Could you be ready to 
leave by four?” 

Casher frowned at his watch, 
which had the conventional 
twenty-four hours. 

The Administrator saw the 
glance and apologized. “Sorry! 
My fault, a thousand times. I’ll 
get you a metric watch right 
away. Ten hours a day, a hun- 
dred minutes an hour. We’re 
really very progressive on Hen- 
riada.” 

He clapped his hands and or- 
dered that a watch be taken to 
Casher’s room, along with a 
watch-repairing robot to adjust 
it to Casher’s body rhythms. 

“Four, then” he said, rising 
briskly from the table. “Dress 
for a trip by ground car. The 
servants will show you how.” 

There was a man already wait- 
ing in Casher’s room. He looked 
like a plump, wise ancient Hin- 
du, as shown in the archeology 
books. He bowed pleasantly and 



said, “My name is Gosigo. I am 
a forgetty, settled on this plan- 
et, but for this day I am your 
guide and driver from this place 
to the mansion of Beauregard.” 
Forgetties were barely above 
underpeople in status. They were 
persons convicted of various 
major crimes, to whom the courts 
of the worlds or the Instrumen- 
tality had allowed total amnesia 
instead of death or some pun- 
ishment worse than death, such 
as the planet Shayol. 

Casher looked at him curious- 
ly. The man did not carry with 
him the permanent air of be- 
wilderment which Casper had 
noticed in many forgetties. Go- 
sigo saw the glance and inter- 
preted it. 

“I’m well enough, now, sir. 
And I am strong enough to 
break your back if I had the 
orders to do it.” 

“You mean, damage my spine? 
What a hostile, unpleasant thing 
to do!” said Casher. “Anyhow, 
I rather think I could kill you 
first if you tried it. Whatever 
gave you such an idea?” 

“The Administrator is always 
threatening people that he will 
have me do it to them.” 

C t T T ave you ever really bro- 
ken anybody’s back?” 
asked Casher, looking Gosigo 
over very carefully and re-judg- 
ing him. The man, though short- 



ON THE STORM PLANET 



15 



er than himself, was luxuriously 
muscled. Like many plump men, 
he looked pleasant on the out- 
side but could be very formid- 
able to an enemy. 

Gosigo smiled briefly, almost 
happily. “Well, no, not exactly.” 

“Why haven’t you? Does the 
Administrator always counter- 
mand his own orders? I should 
think that he would sometimes 
be too drunk to remember to 
do it.” 

“It’s not that,” said Gosigo. 

“Why don’t you, then?” 

“I have other orders,” said 
Gosigo, rather hesitantly. “Like 
the orders I have today. One set 
from the Administrator, one set 
from the Deputy Administrator 
and a third set from an outside 
source.” 

“Who’s the outside source?” 

“She has told me not to ex- 
plain just yet.” 

Casher stood stock still. “Do 
you mean who I think you 
mean?” 

Gosigo nodded very slowly, 
pointing at the ventilator as 
though it might have a micro- 
phone in it. 

“Can you tell me what your 
orders are?” 

“Oh, certainly. The Admini- 
strator has told me to drive you 
to Beauregard, to take you to 
the door, to watch you stab the 
undergirl and to call the second 
ground car to your rescue. The 



Deputy Administrator has told 
me to take you to Beauregard 
and to let you do as you please, 
bringing you back here by way 
of Ambiloxi if you happen to 
come out of Mister Murray’s 
house alive.” 

“And the other orders?” 

“To close the door upon you 
when you enter and to think of 
you no more in this life, because 
you will be very happy.” 

“Are you crazy?” cried Cash- 
er. 

“I am a forgetty,” said Gosi- 
go, with some dignity, “but I 
am not insane.” 

“Whose orders are you going 
to obey, then?” 

Gosigo smiled a warmly hu- 
man smile at him. “Doesn’t that 
depend on you, sir, and not on 
me? Do I look like a man who 
is going to kill you soon?” 

“No, you don’t,” said Casher. 
“Do you think what you look 
like to me?” went on Gosigo, 
with a purr. “Do you really think 
that I would help you if I 
thought that you would kill a 
small girl?” 

“You know it!” cried Casher, 
feeling his face go white. 

“Who doesn’t?” said Gosigo. 
“What else have we got to talk 
about, here on Henriada? Let me 
help you on with these clothes, 
so that you will at least survive 
the ride.” With this he handed 
shoulder padding and a padded 



W 



GALAXY 



helmet to Casher, who began to 
put on the garments, very clum- 
sily. 

Gosigo helped him. 

TXT'hen Casher was fully 

” dressed, he thought that he 
had never dressed this elabor- 
ately for space itself. The world 
of Henriada must be a tumult- 
uous place if people needed this 
kind of clothing to make a short 
trip. 

Gosigo had put on the same 
kind of clothes. 

He looked at Casher, friendily, 
with an arch smile which came 
close to humor. “Look at me, 
honorable visitor. Do I remind 
you of anybody?” 

Casher looked honestly and 
carefully, and then said, “No, 
you don’t.” 

The man’s face fell. “It’s a 
game,” he said. “I can’t help 
trying to find out who I really 
am. Am I a Lord of the In- 
strumentality who has betrayed 
his trust? Am I a scientist who 
twisted knowledge into unimag- 
inable wrong? Am I a dictator 
so foul that even the Instrumen- 
tality, which usually leaves 
things alone, had to step in and 
wipe me out? Here I am, healthy, 
wise, alert. I have the name Go- 
sigo on this planet. Perhaps I 
am a mere native of this planet, 
who has committed a local 
crime. I am triggered. If anyone 



ever did tell me my true name 
or my actual past, I have been 
conditioned to shriek loud, fall 
unconscious and forget anything 
which might be said on such an 
occasion. People told me that I 
must have chosen this instead of 
death. Maybe. Death sometimes 
looks tidy to a forgetty.” 

“Have you ever screamed and 
fainted?” 

“I don’t even know that," said 
Gosigo, “no more than you know 
where you are going this very 
day.” 

Casher was tied to the man’s 
mystifications, so he did not let 
himself be provoked into a use- 
less show of curiosity. Inquisi- 
tive about the forgetty himself, 
he asked, 

“Does it hurt?” he asked. 
“Does it hurt to be a forgetty?” 

“No,” said Gosigo, “it doesn’t 
hurt, no more than you will.” 

Gosigo stared suddenly at 
Casher. His voice changed tone 
and became at least one octave 
higher. He clapped his hands to 
his face and panted through his 
hands as if he would never speak 
again. 

“But, oh! the fear — the eerie, 
dreary fear of being me." 

He still stared at Casher. 

Quieting down at last, he pull- 
ed his hands away from his face, 
as if by sheer force, and said in 
an almost-normal voice, “Shall 
we get on with our trip?” 



ON THE STORM PLANET 



17 



G osigo led the way out into the 
bare bleak corridor. A per- 
ceptible wind was blowing 
through it, though there was no 
sign of an open window or door. 
They followed a majestic stair- 
case, with steps so broad that 
Casher had to keep changing 
pace on them, all the way down 
to the bottom of the building. 
This must at some time have 
been a formal reception hall. 
Now it was full of cars. 

Curious cars. Land vehicles of 
a kind which Casher had never 
seen before. They looked a little 
bit like the ancient “fighting 
tanks” which he had seen in pic- 
tures. They also looked a little 
like submarines of a singularly 
short and ugly shape. They had 
high spiked wheels, but their 
most complicated feature was a 
set of giant corkscrews, four on 
each side, attached to the car by 
intricate but operational appa- 
ratus. Since Casher had been 
landed right into the palace by 
planoform, he had never had oc- 
casion to go outside among the 
tornadoes of Henriada. 

The Administrator was wait- 
ing, wearing a coverall on which 
was stencilled his insignia of 
rank. 

Casher gave him a polite bow. 
He glanced down at the hand- 
some metric wristwatch which 
Gosigo had strapped on his wrist, 
outside the coverall. It read 3:95. 



Casher bowed to Rankin 
Meiklejohn and said: 

“I’m ready, sir, if you are.” 

“Watch him!” whispered Gos- 
igo, half a step behind Casher. 

The Administrator said, 
“Might as well be going.” His 
voice trembled. 

Casher stood polite, alert, im- 
mobile. Was this danger? Was 
this foolishness? Could the Ad- 
ministrator already be drunk 
again? 

Casher watched the Adminis- 
trator carefully but quietly, wait- 
ing for the older man to precede 
him into the nearest ground car, 
which had its door standing 
opened. 

Nothing happened, except that 
the Administrator began to turn 
pale. 

There must have been six or 
eight people present. The others 
must have seen the same sort of 
thing before, because they 
showed no sign of curiosity or 
bewilderment. The Administra- 
tor began to tremble. Casher 
could see it, even through the 
bulk of the travelwear. The 
man’s hands shook. 

The Administrator said, in a 
high nervous voice: “Your knife, 
you have it with you?” 

Casher nodded. 

“Let me see it,” said the Ad- 
ministrator. 

Casher reached down to his 
boot and brought out the beau- 



18 



GALAXY 



tiful superbly balanced knife. Be- 
fore he could stand erect, he felt 
the clamp of Gosigo’s heavy fin- 
gers on his shoulder. 

“Master,” said Gosigo to 
Meiklejohn, “tell your visitor to 
put the weapon away. It is not 
allowed for any of us to show 
weapons in your presence.” 

C asher tried to s uirm out of 
the heavy grip without los- 
ing his balance or his dignity. He 
found that Gosigo was know- 
ledgeable about karate too. The 
forgetty held ground, even when 
the two men waged an immobile, 
invisible sort of wrestling match, 
the leverage of Casher’s shoul- 
der working its way hither and 
yon against the strong grip of 
Gosigo’s powerful hand. 

The Administrator ended it; he 
said, “Put away your knife,” in 
that high funny voice of his. 

The watch had almost reached 
4:00 but no one had yet gotten 
into the car. 

Gosigo spoke again, and when 
he did there was a contemptuous 
laugh from the Deputy Admin- 
istrator, who had stood by in or- 
dinary indoor clothes. 

“Master, isn’t it time for 
‘one for the road’?” 

“Of course, of course,” chat- 
tered the Administrator. He be- 
gan breathing almost normally. 

“Join me,” he said to Casher. 
“It’s a local custom.” 



Casher had let his knife slip 
back into his bootsheath; when 
the knife dropped out of sight 
Gosigo had released his shoul- 
der; he now stood facing the Ad- 
ministrator and rubbing his 
shoulder. He said nothing, but 
shook his head gently, showing 
that he definitely did not want a 
drink. 

One of the robots brought the 
Administrator a glass which ap- 
peared to contain at least a liter 
and a half of water. The Admin- 
istrator said, very politely, “Sure 
you won’t share it?” 

This close, Casher could smell 
the reek of it. It was pure bye- 
garr, and at least 160 proof. He 
shook his head again, firmly but 
also politely. 

The Administrator lifted the 
glass. 

Casher could see the muscles 
of the man’s throat work as the 
liquid went down. He could hear 
the man breathing heavily be- 
tween swallows. The white liquid 
went lower and lower in the gi 
gantic glass. 

At last it was all gone. 

The Administrator cocked his 
head sidewise and said to Cash- 
er in a parrot- like voice, “Well, 
toodle-oo!” 

“What do you mean, sir?” said 
Casher. 

The Administrator had a pleas- 
ant glow on his face. Casher was 
surprised that the man was not 



ON THE STORM PLANET 



19 



dead after that big and sudden 
a drink. 

“I just mean, g’by. I’m not 
feeling . well.” 

With that he fell straight for- 
ward, as stiff as a rock tower. 
One of the servants, perhaps an- 
other forgetty, caught him before 
he hit the ground. 

“Does he always do this?” said 
Casher to the miserable and con- 
temptuous Deputy Administra- 
tor. 

“Oh, no,” said the Deputy. 
“Only at times like these.” 

“What do you mean, ‘like 
these’?” 

“When he sends one more 
armed man against the girl at 
Beauregard. They never come 
back. You won’t come back, 
either. You could have left ear- 
lier, but you can’t now. Go along 
and try to kill the girl. I’ll see 
you here about 5:25 if you suc- 
ceed. As a matter of fact, if you 
come back at all, I’ll try to wake 
him up. But you won’t come 
back. Good luck. I suppose that’s 
what you need.” 

C asher shook hands with the 
man without removing his 
gloves. Gosigo had already 
climbed into the driver’s seat of 
the machine and was testing the 
electric engines. The big cork- 
screws began to plunge down. 
But before they touched the 
floor Gosigo had reversed them 



and thrown them back into the 
“up” position. 

The people in the room ran 
for cover as Casher entered the 
machine, though there was no im- 
mediate danger in sight. Two of 
the human servants dragged the 
Administrator up the stairs, the 
Deputy Administrator following 
them rapidly. 

“Seat belt,” said Gosigo. 

Casher found it and snapped 
it to. 

“Head belt,” said Gosigo. 

Casher stared at him. He had 
never heard of a head belt. 

“Pull it down from the roof, 
sir. Put the net under your chin.” 

Casher glanced up. 

There was a net fitted snug 
against the roof of the vehicle, 
just above his head. He started 
to pull it down, but it did not 
yield. Angrily, he pulled harder, 
and it moved slowly downward. 
“By the Bell and Bank, do they 
want to hang me in this!” he 
thought to himself as he dragged 
the net down. There was a strong 
fibre belt attached to each end 
of the net, while the net itself was 
only fifteen to twenty centi- 
meters wide. He ended up in a 
foolish position, holding the head 
belt with both hands lest it snap 
back into the ceiling and not 
knowing what to do with it. Gos- 
igo leaned over and, half-impa- 
tiently, helped him adjust the 
web under his chin. It pinched 



20 



GALAXY 



for a moment and Casher felt as 
though his head were being 
dragged by a heavy weight. 

“Don’t fight it,” said Gosigo. 
“Relax.” 

Casher did. His head was lifted 
several centimeters into a foam 
pocket, which he had not pre- 
viously noticed, in the back of 
the seat. After a second or two, 
he realized that the position was 
odd but comfortable. 

Gosigo had adjusted his own 
head belt and had turned on the 
lights of the vehicle. They blazed 
so bright that Casher almost 
thought they might be a laser, 
capable of charring the inner 
doors of the big room. 

The lights must have keyed 
the door. 

IV 

^Tpwo panels slid open and a 
wild uproar of wind and 
vegetation rushed in. It was 
rough and stormy but far below 
hurricane velocity. 

The machine rolled forward 
clumsily and was out of the house 
and on the road very quickly. 

The sky was brown, bright 
luminous brown, shot through 
with streaks of yellow. Casher 
had never seen a sky of that 
color on any other world he had 
visited, and in his long exile he 
had seen many planets. 

Gosigo, staring straight ahead, 



was preoccupied with keeping 
the vehicle right in the middle 
of the black, soft, tarry road. 

“Watch it!” said a voice speak- 
ing right into his head. 

It was Gosigo, using an inter- 
com which must have been built 
into the helmets. 

Casher watched, though there 
was nothing to see except for the 
rush of mad wind. Suddenly the 
ground car turned dark, spun up- 
side down, and was violently 
shaken. An oily, pungent stench 
of pure fetor immediately dren- 
ched the whole car. 

Gosigo pulled out a panel with 
a console of buttons. Light and 
fire, intolerably bright, burned 
in on them through the wind- 
shield and portholes on the side. 

The battle was over before it. 
began. 

The ground car lay in a sort of 
swamp. The road was visible 
thirty or thirty-five meters away. 

There was a grinding sound 
inside the machine and the 
ground car righted itself. A sin- 
gular sucking noise followed, then 
the grinding sound stopped. 
Casher could glimpse the big 
corkscrews on the side of the car 
eating their way into the ground. 

At last the machine was steady, 
pelted only by branches, leaves, 
and what seemed like kelp. 

A small tornado was passing 
over them. 

Gosigo took time to twist his 

21 



ON THE STORM PLANET 



head sidewise and to talk to 
Casher. 

“An air-whale swallowed us 
and I had to burn our way out.” 

“A what?” cried Casher. 

“An air-whale,” repeated Gos- 
igo calmly on the intercom. 
“There are no indigenous forms 
of life on this planet, but the im- 
ported Earth forms have changed 
wildly since we brought them in. 
The tornadoes lifted the whales 
around enough so that s^me of 
them got adapted to flying. They 
were the meat-eating kind, so 
they like to crack our ground 
cars open and eat the goodies in- 
side. We’re safe enough from 
them for the time being, provid- 
ed we can make it back to the 
road. There are a few wild men 
who live in the wind, but they 
would not become dangerous to 
us unless we found ourselves 
really helpless. Pretty soon I can 
unscrew us from the ground and 
try to get back on the road. It’s 
not really too far from here to 
Ambiloxi.” 

The trip to the road was a long 
one, even though they could see 
the road itself all the times that 
they tried various approaches. 

The first time, the ground car 
tipped ominously forward. Red 
lights showed on the panel and 
buzzers buzzed. The great spiked 
wheels spun in vain as they 
chewed their way into a bottom- 
less quagmire. 



Gosigo, calling back to his pas- 
senger, cried, “Hold steady! 
We’re going to have to shoot our- 
selves out of this one backward!” 
Casher did not know how he 
could be any steadier, belted, 
hooded and strapped as he was, 
but he clutched the arms of his 
seat. 

'TT'he world went red with fire 
^ as the front of the car spat 
flame in rocket-like quantities. 
The swamp ahead of them 
boiled into steam, so that they 
could see nothing. 

Gosigo changed the windshield 
over from visual to radar, and 
even with radar there was not 
much to be seen — nothing but a 
gray swirl for formless wraiths, 
and the weird lurching sensation 
as the machine fought its way 
back to solid ground. The con- 
sole suddenly showed green and 
Gosigo cut the controls. They 
were back where they had been, 
with the repulsive burnt entrails 
of the air-whale scattered among 
the coral trees. 

“Try again,” said Gosigo, as 
though Casher had something to 
do with the matter. 

He fiddled with the controls 
and the ground car rose several 
feet. The spikes on the wheels 
had been hydraulically extended 
until they were each at least 150 
centimeters long. In sensation, 
the car felt like a large enclosed 



22 



GALAXY 



bicycle as it teetered on its big 
wheels. The wind was strong and 
capricious but there was no tor- 
nado in sight. 

“Here we go,” said Gosigo. The 
ground car pressed forward in a 
mad rush, hastening obliquely 
through the vegetation and mak- 
ing for the highway on Casher’s 
right. 

A bone-jarring crash told them 
that they had not made it. For 
a moment he was too dizzy to 
see where they were. 

He was glad of his helmet and 
happy about the web brace which 
held his neck. That crash would 
have killed him if he had not 
had full protection. 

Gosigo seemed to think the 
trip normal. His classic Hindu 
features relaxed in a wise smile 
as he said, “Hit a boulder. Fell 
on our side. Try again.” 

Casher managed to gasp, “Is 
the machine unbreakable?” 

There was a laugh in Gosigo’s 
voice when he answered. “Al- 
most. We’re the most vulnerable 
in it.” 

Again fire spat at the ground, 
this time from the side of the 
ground car. It balanced itself 
precariously on the four high 
wheels. Gosigo turned on the 
radar screen to see through the 
steam which their own jets had 
called up. 

There the road was, plain and 
near. 



“Try again!” he shouted, as 
the machine lunged forward and 
then performed a veritable ballet 
on the surface of the marsh. It 
rushed, slowed, turned around 
on a hummock, gave itself an 
assist with the jets and then 
scrambled through the water. 

Casher saw the inverted cone 
of a tornado, half a kilometer or 
less away, veering toward them. 

Gosigo sensed his unspoken 
thought, because he answered: 
“Problem: who gets to the road 
first, that or we?” 

The machine bucked, lurched, 
twisted, spun. 

Casher could see nothing any 
more from the windscreen in 
front, but it was obvious that 
Gosigo knew what he was doing. 

There was the sickening, stom- 
ach-wrenching twist of a big drop 
and then a new sound was heard 
— a grinding as of knives. 

G osigo, unworried, took his 
head out of the head net 
and looked over at Casher with 
a smile. “The twister will prob- 
ably hit us in a minute or two, 
but it doesn’t matter now. We’re 
on the road and I’ve bolted us 
to the surface.” 

“Bolted?” gasped Casher. 
“You know, those big screws 
on the outside of the car. They 
were made to go right into the 
road. All the roads here are neo- 
asphaltum and self-repairing. 



24 



GALAXY 



There will be traces of them 
here when the last known person 
on the last known planet is dead. 
These are good roads.” He 
stopped for the sudden hush. 
“Storm’s going over us.” It be- 
gan again before he could finish 
his sentence. Wild raving winds 
tore at the machine which sat so 
solid that it seemed bedded in 
permastone. 

Gosigo pushed two buttons 
and then calibrated a dial. He 
squinted at his instruments and 
then pressed a button mounted 
on the edge of his navigator’s 
seat. There was a sharp explos- 
ion, like a blasting of rock by 
chemical methods. 

Casher started to speak but 
Gosigo held out a warning hand 
for silence. 

He turned his dials quickly. 
The windscreen faded out, radar 
came on and then went off. At 
last a bright map — bright red in 
background, with sharp gold 
lines — appeared across the whole 
width of the screen. There were 
a dozen or more bright points on 
the map. Gosigo watched these 
intently. 

The map blurred, faded, dis- 
solved into red chaos. 

Gosigo pushed another button 
and then could see out of the 
front glass screen again. 

“What was that?” said Casher. 

“Miniaturized radar rocket. I 
sent it up twelve kilometers for 



a look around. It transmitted a 
map of what it saw and I put it 
on our radar screen. The tor- 
nadoes are heavier than usual, 
but I think we can make it. Did 
you notice the top right of the 
map? 

“The top right?” said Casher. 
“Yes, the top right. Did you 
see what was there?” 

“Why, nothing,” said Casher. 
“Nothing was there.” 

“You’re utterly right,” said 
Gosigo. “What does that mean 
to you?” 

“I don’t understand you,” said 
Casher. “I suppose it means that 
there is nothing there.” 

“Right again. But let me tell 
you something. There never is.” 
• “Never is what?” 

“Anything,” said Gosigo. 
“'’'here never is anything cm the 
maps at that point. That’s east 
of Ambiloxi. That’s Beauregard. 
It never shows on the maps. 
Nothing happens there.” 

“No bad weather — ever ?” said 
Casher. 

“Never,” said Gosigo. 

“Why not?” said Casher. 
“She will not permit it,” said 
Gosigo firmly, as though his 
words made sense. 

ttAT'ou mean, her weather ma- 
’ chines work?” said Cash- 
er, grasping for the only rational 
explanation possible. 

“Yes,” said Gosigo. 



ON THE STORM PLANET

“Why?” Casher asked, more 
perplexed than ever. 

“She pays for them.” 

“How can she?” exclaimed 
Casher. “Your whole world of 
Henriada is bankrupt!” 

“Her part isn’t.” 

“Stop mystifying me,” said 
Casher. “Tell me who she is and 
what this is all about.” 

“Put you head in the net,” said 
Gosigo. “I am not making puzzles 
because I want to do so. I have 
been commanded not to talk.” 
“Because you are a forgetty.” 
‘What’s that got to do with it? 
Don’t talk to me that way. Re- 
member, I am not an animal or 
an underperson. I may be your 
servant for a few hours, but I 
am a man. You’ll find out, soon 
enough. Hold tight!" 

The ground car came to a 
panic stop, the spiked teeth eat- 
ing into the resilient firm neo- 
asphaltum of the road. At the 
instant they stopped, the out- 
side corkscrews began chewing 
their way into the ground. First 
Casher felt as though his eyes 
were popping out, because of the 
suddenness of the deceleration; 
now he felt like holding the arms 
of his seat as the tornado reached 
directly for their car, plucking at 
it again and again. The enor- 
mous outside screws held and he 
could feel the car straining to 
meet the gigantic suction of the 
storm. 



“Don’t worry,” shouted Gos- 
igo over the noise of the storm. 
“I always spin us down a little 
bit more by firing the quick- 
rockets straight up. These cars 
don’t often go off the road.” 

Casher tried to relax. 

The funnel of the tornado, 
which seemed almost like a living 
being, plucked after them once 
or twice more and then was gone 
as suddenly as it had hit. 

This time, Casher had seen no 
sign of the air-whales which rode 
the storms. He had seen nothing 
but rain and wind and desola- 
tion. 

The tornado was gone in a 
moment. Ghostlike shapes trailed 
after it in enormous prancing 
leaps. 

“Wind-men,” said Gosigo 
glancing at them incuriously. 
“Wild people who have learned 
to live on Henriada. They aren’t 
much more than animals. We are 
close to the territory of the lady. 
They would not dare attack us 
here.” 

Casher O’Neill was too stun- 
ned to query the man or to 
challenge him. He tried once 
more to relax. 

Once more the car picked it- 
self up and coursed along the 
smooth, narrow, winding neo- 
asphaltum road, almost as though 
the machine itself were glad to 
function and to be functioning 
well.

/dasher could never quite re- 
member when they went 
from the howling wildness of 
Henriada into the stillness and 
beauty of the domains of Mister 
Murray Madigan. He could re- 
call the feeling but not the facts. 

The town of Ambiloxi eluded 
him completely. It was so nor- 
mal a town, so old-fashioned a 
little town that he could not 
think of it very much. Old peo- 
ple sat on the wooden boardwalk 
taking thei'r afternoon look at 
the strangers who passed through. 
Horses were tethered in a row 
along main street, between the 
parked machines. It looked like 
a peaceful picture from the an- 
cient ages. 

Of tornadoes there was no sign, 
nor of the hurt and ruin which 
showed around the house of Ran- 
kin Meiklejohn. There were few 
underpeople or robots about, un- 
less they were so cleverly con- 
trived as to look almost exactly 
like real people. How can you 
remember something which is 
pleasant and non-memorable? 
Even the buildings did not show 
signs of being fortified again t 
the frightful storms which had 
brought the prosperous planet of 
Henriada to a condition of aban- 
donment and ruin. Gosigo, who 
had a remarkable talent for stat- 
ing the obvious, said tonelessly. 



“The weather machines are 
working here. There is no need 
for special precaution.” But he 
did not stop in the town for 
rest, refreshments, conversation 
or fuel. He went through deftly 
and quietly, the gigantic armored 
ground car looking out of place 
among the peaceful and defense- 
less vehicles. He went as though 
he had been on the same route 
many times before, and knew 
the routine well. 

Once beyond Ambiloxi he 
speeded up, though at a moder- 
ate pace, compared to the fran- 
tic elusive action he had taken 
against storms in the earlier part 
of the trip. The landscape was 
earthlike . wet . and most 
of the ground was covered with 
vegetation. 

Old radar countermissile tow- 
ers stood along the road. 

Casher could not imagine their 
possible use, even though he was 
sure, from the looks of them, 
that they were long obsolete. 

“What’s the countermissile ra- 
dar for?” he asked, speaking 
comfortably now that his head 
was out of the head net. 

Gosigo turned around and gave 
him a tortured glance in which 
pain and bewilderment were 
mixed. “Countermissile radar? 
Countermissile radar? I don’t 
know that word, though it seems 
as though I should . .” 

“Radar is what you were us- 

27 



ON THE STORM PtANET 



ing to see with, back in the storm, 
when the ceiling and visibility 
were zero.” 

Gosigo turned back to his driv- 
ing, narrowly missing a tree. 
“That? That’s just artificial vi- 
sion. Why did you use the word 
‘countermissile radar’? There 
isn’t any of that stuff here ex- 
cept what we have on our ma- 
chine, though the mistress may 
be watching us if her set is on.” 
“Those towers,” said Casher. 
“They look like countermissile 
towers from the ancient times.” 
“Towers. There aren’t any 
towers here,” snapped Gosigo. 

“Look,” cried Casher. “Here 
are two more of them.” 

“Oh, no man made those. They 
aren’t buildings, just air coral. 
Some of the coral which people 
brought from earth mutated and 
got so it could live in the air. 
People used to plant it for wind- 
breaks, before they decided to 
give up Henriada and move out. 
They didn’t do much good, but 
they are pretty to look at.” 

'Tphey rode along a few minutes 
without asking questions. 
Tall trees had Spanish moss trail- 
ing over them. They were close 
to a sea. Small marshes appeared 
to the right and left of the road; 
here, where the endless torna- 
does were kept out, everything 
had a park-like effect. The do- 
mains of the estate of Beaure- 



gard were unlike anything else 
on Henriada — an area at 
peaceful wildness in a world 
which was rushing otherwise to- 
ward uninhabitability and ruin. 
Even Gosigo seemed more re- 
laxed, more cheerful as he steer- 
ed the ground car along the 
pleasant elevated road. 

Gosigo sighed, leaned forward, 
managed the controls and 
brought the car to a stop. 

He turned around calmly and 
looked full-face at Casher 
O’Neill. 

“You have your knife?” 

Casher automatically felt for 
it. It was there, safe enough in 
his bootsheath. He simply nod- 
ded. 

“You have your orders.” 

“You mean, killing the girl?” 

“Yes,” said Gosigo, “killing the 
girl.” 

“I remember that. You didn’t 
have to stop the car to tell me 
that.” 

“I’m telling you now,” said 
Gosigo, his wise Hindu face 
showing neither humor nor out- 
rage. “Do it.” 

“You mean, kill her? Right at 
first sight?” 

“Do it,” said Gosigo. “You 
have your orders.” 

“I’m the judge of that,” said 
Casher. “It will be on my con- 
science. Are you watching me 
for the Administrator?” 

“That drunken fool?” said 



28 



GALAXY 



Gosigo. “I don’t care about him, 
except that I am a forgetty and 
I belong to him. We’re in her 
territory now. You are going to 
do whatever she wants. You 
have orders to kill her. All right. 
Kill her.” 

“You mean — she wants to be 
murdered?” 

“Of course not!” said Gosigo, 
with the irritation of an adult 
who has to explain too many 
things to an inquisitive child. 

“Then how can I kill her with- 
out finding out what this is all 
about?” 

“She knows. She knows her- 
self — she knows her master — 
she knows this planet. She knows 
me and she knows something 
about you. Go ahead and kill 
her, since those are your orders. 
If she wants to die, that’s not 
for you or me to decide. It’s her 
business. If she does not want 
to die, you will not succeed.” 

“I’d like to see the person,” 
said Casher, “who could stop me 
in a sudden knife attack. Have 
you told her that I am coming?” 

“I’ve told her nothing, but she 
knows we are coming and she is 
pretty sure what you have been 
sent for. Don’t think about it. 
Just do what you are told. Jump 
for her with the knife. She will 
take care of the matter.” 

“But — ” cried Casher. 

“Stop asking questions,” said 
Gosigo. “Just follow orders and 



remember that she will take care 
of you. Even you.” He started 
up the ground car. 

Within less than a kilometer 
they had crossed a low ridge of 
land and there before them lay 
Beauregard — the mansion at 
the edge of the waters, its white 
pillars shining, its pergolas glis- 
tening in the bright air, its yards 
and palmettos tidy. 

Casher was a brave man, but 
he felt the palms of his hands go 
wet when he realized that in a 
minute or two he would have to 
commit a murder. 

VI 

'Hphe ground car swung up the 
drive. It stopped. Without a 
word, Gosigo activated the door. 
The air smelled calm, sea-wet, 
salt and yet coolly fresh. 

Casher jumped out and ran to 
the door, surprised to feel that 
his legs trembled as he ran. 

He had killed before, real men 
in real quarrels. Why should a 
mere animal matter to him? 

The door stopped him. 

Without thinking, he tried to 
wrench it open. 

The knob did not yield and 
there was no automatic control 
in sight. This was indeed a very 
antique sort of house. He struck 
the door with his hands. The 
thuds sounded around him. He 
could not tell whether they re- 



ON THE STORM PLANET 



29 



sounded in the house. No sound 
or echo came from beyond the 
door. 

He began rehearsing the 
phrase, “I want to see Mister 
and Owner Madigan . 

The door did open. 

A little girl stood there. 

He knew her. He had always 
Known her. She was his sweet- 
heart, come back out of his child- 
hood. She was the sister he had 
never had. She was his own 
mother, when young. She was at 
the marvellous age, somewhere 
between ten and thirteen, where 
the child — as the phrase goes 
— “becomes an old old child 
and not a raw grown-up.” She 
was kind, calm, intelligent, ex- 
pectant, quiet, inviting, unafraid. 
She felt like someone he had 
never left behind: yet, at the 
same moment, he knew he had 
never seen her before. 

He heard his voice asking for 
the Mister and Owner Madigan 
while he wondered, at the bask 
of his mind, who the girl might 
be. Madigan’s daughter? Neither 
Rankin Meiklejohn nor the de- 
puty had said anything about a 
human family. 

The child looked at him level- 
ly- 

He must have finished bray- 
ing his question at her. 

“Mister and Owner Madigan,” 
said the child, “sees no one thin 
day, but you are seeing me.” 



There was humor and fearless- 
ness in her eyes. 

“Who are you?” he blurted 
out. 

“I am the housekeeper of this 
house. My name is T’ruth.” 

His knife was in his hand be- 
fore he knew how it had gotten 
there. He remembered the ad- 
vice of the Administrator: 
plunge, plunge, stab, stab, run! 

She saw the knife but her 
eyes did not waver from his 
face. 

He looked at her uncertainly. 

I f this was an underperson, it 
was the most remarkable one 
he had ever seen. But even 
Gosigo had told him to do his 
duty, to stab, to kill the woman 
named T’ruth. Here she was. He 
could not do it. 

He spun the knife in the air, 
caught it by its tip and held it 
out to her, handle first. 

“I was sent to kill you,” he 
said, “but I find I cannot do it. 
I have lost a cruiser.” 

“Kill me if you wish,” she 
said, “because I have no fear of 
you.” 

Her calm words were so far 
outside his experience that he 
took the knife in his left hand 
and lifted his arm as if to stab 
toward her. 

He dropped his arm. 

“I cannot do it,” he whined. 
“What have you done to me?” 



30 



GALAXY 



“I have done nothing to you. 
You do not wish to kill a child 
and I look to you like a child. 
Besides, I think you love me. If 
this ig so, it must be very com- 
fortable for you.” 

Casher heard his knife clatter 
to the floor as he dropped it. He 
had never dropped it before. 

“Who are you,” he gasped, 
“that you should do this to me?” 
“I am me,” she said, her voice 
as tranquil and happy as that of 
any girl, provided that the girl 
was caught at a moment of great 
happiness and poise. “I am the 
housekeeper of this house.” She 
smiled almost impishly and add- 
ed, “It seems that I must almost 
be the ruler of this planet as 
well.” Her voice turned serious. 
“Man,” she said, “can’t you see 
it, man? I am an animal, a turtle. 
I am incapable of disobeying the 
word of man. When I was little 
I was trained and I was given 
orders. I shall carry out those 
orders as long as I live. When I 
look at you, I feel strange. You 
look as though you loved me al- 
ready, but you do not know what 
to do. Wait a moment. I must 
let Gosigo go.” 

The shining knife on the floor 
of the doorway, she saw: she 
stepped over it. 

Gosigo had gotten out of the 
ground car and was giving her a 
formal, low bow. 

“Tell me,” she cried, “what 



you have just seen!” There was 
friendliness in her cell, as though 
the routine were as old game. 

“I saw Casher O’Neill bound 
up the steps. You yourself 
opened the door. He thrust his 
dagger into your throat and the 
blood spat out in a big stream, 
rich and dark and red. You died 
in the doorway. For some reason 
Casher O’Neill went on into the 
house without saying anything 
to me. I became frightened and 
I fled.” 

He did not look frightened at 
all. 

“If I am dead,” she said, “how 
can I be talking to you?” 

“Don’t ask me,” cried Gosigo. 
“I am just a forgetty. I always 
go back to the Honorable Ran- 
kin Meiklejohn, each time that 
you are murdered, and I tell 
him the truth of what I saw. 
Then he gives me the medicine 
and I tell him something else. 
At that point he will get drunk 
and gloomy again, the way that 
he always does.” 

“It’s a pity,” said the child. 
“I wish I could help him, but I 
can’t. He won’t come to Beaure- 
gard.” 

“Him?” laughed Gosigo. “Oh, 
no, not him! Never! He just 
sends other people to kill you.” 
“And he’s never satisfied,” 
said the child sadly, “no matter 
how many times he kills me!” 
“Never,” said Gosigo cheer-

fully, climbing back into the 
ground car. “ ’By now.” 

“Wait a moment,” she called. 
“Wouldn’t you like something to 
eat ox drink before you drive 
back. There’s a bad clutch of 
Storms on the road.” 

“Not me,” said Gosigo. “He 
might punish me and make me 
a forgetty all over again. Say, 
maybe that’s already happened. 
Maybe I’m a forgetty who’s been 
put through it several times, not 
just once.” Hope surged into his 
voice. “T’ruth! T’ruth! Can you 
tell me?” 

“Suppose I did tell you,” said 
she. “What would happen?” 

T Tis face became sad, “I’d have 
a convulsion and forget what 
I told you. Well, good-by any- 
how. I’ll take a chance on the 
storms. If you ever see that 
Casher O’Neill again,” called 
Gosigo, looking right through 
Casher O'Neill, “tell him I liked 
him but that we’ll never meet 
again.” 

“I’ll tell him,” said the girl 
gently. She watched as the heavy 
brown man climbed nimbly into 
the car. The top crammed shut 
with no sound. The wheels turn- 
ed and in a moment the car had 
disappeared behind the palmet- 
toes in the drive. 

While she had talked to Gosi- 
go in her clear warm high girlish 
voice, Casher had watched her. 



He could see the thin shape of 
her shoulders under the light 
blue shift that she wore. Her 
hips had not begun to fill. When 
he glanced at her in one-quar- 
ter profile, he could see that her 
cheek was smooth, her hair well- 
combed, her little breasts just be- 
ginning to bud on her chest. 
Who was this child who acted 
like an empress? 

She turned back to him and 
gave him a warm, apologetic 
smile. 

“Gosigo and I always talk 
over the story together. Then he 
goes back and Meiklejohn does 
not believe it and spends un- 
happy months planning my 
murder all over again. I suppose, 
since I am just an animal, that 
I should not call it a ‘murder’ 
when somebody tries to kill me, 
but I resist, of course. I do not 
care about me, but I have strong 
orders to keep my master and 
his house safe from harm.” 
“How old are you?” said 
Casher. He added, “ — if you 
can tell the truth.” 

“I can tell nothing but the 
truth. I am conditioned. I am 
nine hundred and six earth-years 
old.” 

“Nine hundred?” he cried. 
“But you look like a child!” 

“I am a child,” said the girl, 
“and not a child. I am an earth 
turtle, changed into human form 
by the convenience of man. My 



32 



GALAXY 



life expectancy was increased 
three hundred times when I was 
modified. They tell me that my 
normal life span should have 
been three hundred years. Now 
it is ninety thousand years, and 
sometimes I am afraid. You will 
be dead of happy old age, 
Casher O’Neill, while I am still 
opening the drapes in this house 
to ler the sunlight in. But let’s 
not stand in the door and talk. 
Come on in and get some re- 
freshments. You’re not going 
anywhere, you know.” 

Casher followed her into the 
house but he put his worry into 
words, “You mean I am your 
prisoner.” 

“Not my prisoner, Casher. 
Yours. How could you cross that 
ground which you travelled in 
the ground car? You could get 
to the ends of my estate all 
right, but then the storms would 
pick you up and whirl you away 
to a death which nobody would 
even see.” 

She turned into a big old room, 
bright with light- colored wooden 
furniture. 

VII 

/dasher stood there, awkward- 
^ ly. He had returned his knife 
to its boot-sheath when they left 
the vestibule. Now he felt very 
odd, sitting with his victim on a 
sun-porch. 



T’ruth was untroubled. She 
rang a brass bell which stood 
on an old-fashioned round table 
Feminine footsteps clattered ia 
the hall. A female servant enter- 
ed the room, dressed in a black 
dress with a white apron. Casher 
had seen such servants in the 
old drama cubes, but he had 
never expected to meet one is 
the flesh. 

“We’ll have high tea,” said 
T’ruth. “Which do you prefer, 
tea or coffee, Casher? Or I have 
beer and wines. Even two bottles 
of whiskey brought all the way 
from Earth.” 

“Coffee would be fine for me," 
said Casher. 

“And you know what I want, 
Eunice,” said T’ruth to the ser- 
vant. 

“Yes, ma’am,” said the maid, 
disappearing. 

Casher leaned forward. 

“That servant — is she hu- 
man?” 

“Certainly,” said T’ruth. 

“Then why is she working for 
an underperson like you? I mean 
— I don’t mean to be unpleasant 
or anything — but I mean that’s 
against all laws.” 

“Not here on Henriada, it 
isn’t.” 

“And why not?” persisted 
Casher. 

“Because on Henriada I am 
myself the law.” 

“But the government — ?” 



ON THE STORM PLANET 



33 



"It’s gone,” she said calmly. 
“The Instrumentality?” 

T’ruth frowned. She looked 
like a wise, puzzled child. “May- 
be you know that part better 
than I do. They leave an ad- 
ministrator here, probably be- 
cause they do not have any other 
place to put him and because 
he needs some kind of work to 
keep him alive. Yet they do not 
give him enough real power to 
arrest my master or to kill me. 
They ignore me. It seems to me 
that if I do not challenge them, 
they leave me alone.” 

“But their rules — ?” 

“They don’t enforce them, 
neither here in Beauregard nor 
over in the town of Ambiloxi. 
They leave it up to me to keep 
these places going. I do the best 
I can.” 

“That servant, then? Did they 
lease her to you?” 

“Oh, no,” laughed the girl- 
woman. “She came to kill me 
twenty years ago, but she was a 
forgetty and she had no place 
else to go, so I trained her as 
a maid. She has a contract with 
my master, and her wages are 
paid every month into the satel- 
lite above the planet. She can 
leave if she ever wants to. I 
don’t think she will.” 

Rasher sighed. “This is all too 
^ ' hard to believe. You are a 
child, but you are almost a thou- 

34 



sand years old. You're an under- 
person, but you command a 
whole planet — ” 

“Only when I need to!” she 
interrupted him. 

“You are wiser than most of 
the people I have ever known 
and yet you look young. How 
old do you feel?” 

“I feel like a child,” she said, 
“a child one thousand years old. 
And I have had the education 
and the memory and the experi- 
ence of a wise lady stamped right 
into my brain.” 

“Who was the lady?” said 
Casher. 

“The Owner and Citizen 
Agatha Madigan. The wife of my 
master. As she was dying they 
transcribed her brain on mine. 
That’s why I speak so well and 
know so much.” 

“But that’s illegal!” cried 
Casher. 

“I suppose it was,” T’ruth 
agreed, “but my master had it 
done anyhow.” 

Casher leaned forward in his 
chair. He looked earnestly at the 
person. One part of him still 
loved her for the wonderful little 
girl whom he had thought she 
was, but another part was in 
awe of being more powerful than 
anyone he had seen before. She 
returned his gaze with that com- 
posed half-smile which was whol- 
ly feminine and completely self- 
possessed; she looked tenderly 



GALAXY 



upon him as their faces were 
reflected by the yellow morning 
light of Henriada. “I begin to 
understand,” he said, “that you 
are what you have to be. It is 
very strange, here in this for- 
gotten world.” 

“Henriada is strange,” she said, 
“and I suppose that I must 
seem strange to you. You are 
right, though, about each of us 
being what she has to be. Isn’t 
that liberty itself? If we each 
one must be something, isn’t lib- 
erty the business of finding it 
out and then doing it — that one 
job, that uttermost mission com- 
patible with our natures? How 
terrible it would be, to be some- 
thing and never know what!” 

“Like who?” said Casher. 

“Like Gosigo, perhaps. He was 
a great king and he was a good 
king, on some faraway world 
where they still need kings. But 
he committed an intolerable mis- 
take and the Instrumentality 
made him into a forgetty and 
sent him here.” 

“So that’s the mystery!” said 
Casher. “And what am I?” 

Ohe looked at him calmly and 
^ steadfastly before she an- 
swered. “You are a killer, Casher 
O’Neill. You are a good man, but 
you are a killer too. It must 
make your life very hard in 
many ways. You keep having to 
justify yourself.” 



This was so close to the truth 
— so close to Casher’s long wor- 
ries as to whether justice might 
not just be a cover name for 
“revenge” — that it was his turn 
to gasp and be silent. 

“And I have work for you,” 
added the amazing child. 
“Work? Here?” 

“Yes. Something much worse 
than killing. And you must do 
it, Casher, if you want to go 
away from here before I die, 
eighty-nine thousand years from 
now.” She looked around. 
“Hush!” she added. “Eunice is 
coming and I do not want to 
frighten her by letting her know 
the terrible things that you are 
going to have to do.” 

“Here?” he whispered urgent- 
ly. “Right here, in this house?” 
“Right here in this house,” 
said she in a normal voice, as 
Eunice entered the room bearing 
a huge tray covered with plates 
of food and two pots of beverage. 

Casher stared at the human 
woman who worked so cheerful- 
ly for an animal, but neither 
Eunice, who was busy setting 
things out cm the table, nor 
T’ruth who, turtle and woman 
that she was, could not help 
rearranging the dishes with gen- 
tle peremptories, paid the least 
attention to him. 

The words rang in his head. 
“In this house . something 
worse than killing.” 



ON THE STORM PLANET

They made no sense. Neither 
did it make sense to have high 
tea before five hours, decimal 
time. 

He sighed and they both glanc- 
ed at him with affectionate con- 
cern. 

“He’s taking it better than 
most of them do, ma’am,” said 
Eunice. “Most of them who come 
here to kill you are very upset 
when they find out that they 
cannot do it.” 

“He’s a killer, Eunice, a real 
killer, so I think he wasn’t too 
bothered.” 

Eunice turned to him very 
pleasantly and said, “A killer, 
sir. It’s a pleasure to have you 
here. Most of them are terrible 
amateurs and then the lady has 
to heal them before we can find 
something for them to do.” 

Casher couldn’t resist a spot 
inquiry. “Are all the other would- 
be killers still here?” 

“Most of them, sir. The ones 
that nothing happened to. Like 
me. Where else would we go? 
Back to the Administrator, Ran- 
kin Meiklejohn?” She said the 
last with heavy scorn indeed, 
curtseyed to him, bowed deeply 
to the woman-girl T’ruth, and 
left the room. 

T 'ruth looked friendlily at 
Casher O’Neill. “I can tell 
that you will not digest your 
food if you sit here waiting for 



bad news. When I said you had 
to do something worse than kill- 
ing, I suppose I was speaking 
from a woman’s point of view. 
We have a homicidal maniac in 
the house. He is a house guest 
and he is covered by Old North 
Australian law. That means we 
cannot kill him or expel him, 
though he is almost as immortal 
as I am. I hope that you and 
I can frighten him away from 
molesting my master. I cannot 
cure him or love him. He is too 
crazy to be reached through his 
emotions. Pure, utter awful fright 
might do it, and it takes a man 
for that job. If you do this, I 
will reward you richly.” 

“And if I don’t?” said Casher. 

Again she stared at him as 
though she were trying to see 
through his eyes all the way 
down to the bottom of his soul; 
again he felt for her that tremor 
of compassion, ever so slightly 
tinged with male desire, which 
he had experienced when he first 
met her in the doorway of Beau- 
regard. 

Their locked glances broke 
apart. 

T’ruth looked at the floor. “I 
cannot lie,” she said, as though 
it were a handicap. “If you do 
not help me I shall have to do 
the things which it is in my pow- 
er to do. The chief thing is noth- 
ing. To let you live here, to let 
you sleep and eat in this house 



36 



GALAXY 



until you get bored and ask me 
for some kind of routine work 
around the estate. I could make 
you work,” she went on, looking 
up at him and blushing all the 
way to the top of her bodice, 
“by having you fall in love with 
me, but that would not be kind. 
I will not do it that way. Either 
you make a deal with me or you 
do not. It’s up to you. Anyhow, 
let’s eat first. I’ve been up since 
dawn, expecting one more killer. 
I even wondered if you might 
be the one who would succeed. 
That would be terrible, to leave 
my master all alone!” 

“But you — wouldn’t you your- 
self mind being killed?” 

“Me? When I’ve already lived 
a thousand years and have 
eighty-nine thousand more to go? 
It couldn’t matter less to me. 
Have some coffee.” 

And she poured his coffee. 

VIII 

npwo or three times Casher 
1 tried to get the conversation 
back to the work at hand, but 
T’ruth diverted him with trivial- 
ities. She even made him walk 
to the enormous window, where 
they could see far across the 
marshes and the bay. 

The sky in the remote distance 
was dark and full of worms. 
Those were tornadoes, beyond 
tire reach of her weather ma- 



chines, which coursed around the 
rest of Henriada but stopped 
short at the boundaries of Am- 
biloxi and Beauregard. She made 
him admire the weird coral 
castles which had built them- 
selves up from the bay bottom, 
hundreds of feet into the air. 
She tried to make him see a 
family of wild wind-people who 
were slyly and gently stealing 
apples from her orchard, but 
either his eyes were not used to 
the landscape or T’ruth could see 
much further than he could. 

This was a world rich in 
water. If it had not been located 
within a series of bad pockets 
of space, the water itself could 
have become an export. Man- 
kind had done the best it could, 
raising kelp to provide the iron 
and phosphorus so often lacking 
in off-world diets, controlling the 
weather at great expense. Finally 
the Instrumentality recommend- 
ed that they give up. The exports 
of Henriada never quite balanc- 
ed the imports. The subsidies 
had gone far beyond the usual 
times. The earth-life had adapt- 
ed with a vigor which was much 
too great. Ordinary forms rapid- 
ly found new shapes, challenged 
by the winds, the rains, the novel 
chemistry and the odd radiation 
patterns of Henriada. Killer 
whales became airborne, coral 
took to the air, human babies 
lost in the wind sometimes sur- 



ON THE STORM PLANET

vived to become subhuman and 
wild. Even jellyfish became sky- 
sweepers. 

The former inhabitants of Hen- 
nada had chosen a planet at a 
reasonable price — not cheap, 
but reasonable — from the own- 
er, who had in turn bought it 
from a post-Soviet settling co- 
operative. They had leased the 
new planet, had worked out an 
ecology, had emigrated, and 
were now doing well. 

Henriada kept the wild weath- 
er, the lost hopes and the ruins. 
And of these ruins, the greatest 
was Murray Madigan. 

Once a prime landholder and 
host, a gentleman among gentle- 
men, the richest man on the 
whole world, Madigan had be- 
come old, senile, weak. He faced 
death or catalepsis. The death of 
his wife made him fear his own 
death and with his turtle-girl 
T’ruth, he had chosen catalepsis. 

Most of the time he was froz- 
en in a trance, his heartbeat im- 
perceptible, his metabolism very 
slow. Then, for a few hours or 
days, he was normal. Sometimes 
the sleeps were for weeks, some- 
times for years. The Instrumen- 
tality doctors had looked him 
over — more out of scientific cu- 
riosity than from any judicial 
right — and had decided that 
though this was an odd way to 
live, it was a legal one. They 
went away and left him alone. 



He had had the whole person- 
ality of his dying wife Agatha 
Madigan impressed on the turtle- 
child, though this was illegal. 
Quite simply, the doctor had 
been bribed. 

A 11 this was told by T’ruth to 
Casher as they ate and 
drank their way slowly through 
an immense repast. 

An archaic wood fire roared 
in a real fireplace. 

While she talked, Casher 
watched the gentle movement of 
her shoulderblades when she 
moved forward, the loose move- 
ment of her light dress as she 
moved, the childish face which 
was so tender, so appealing and 
yet so wise. 

Knowing as little as he did 
about the planet of Henriada, 
Casher tried desperately to fit 
his own thinking together and to 
make sense out of the predica- 
ment in which he found himself. 
Even if the girl were attractive, 
this told him nothing of the real 
challenges which he still faced 
inside this very house. No longer 
was his preoccupation with get- 
ting the power cruiser his main 
job on Henriada. No evidence 
was at hand to show that the 
drunken, deranged Administra- 
tor, Rankin Meiklejohn, would 
give him anything at all unless 
he, Casher, killed the girl. 

Even that had become a for- 



38 



GALAXY 



gotten mission. Despite the fact 
that he had come to the estate 
of Beauregard for the purpose 
of killing her, he was now on a 
journey without a destination. 

Years of sad experience had 
taught him that when a project 
went completely to pieces, he 
still had the mission of personal 
survival, if his life were to mean 
anything to his home planet, 
Mizzer, and if his return, in any 
way or any fashion, could bring 
real liberty back to the Twelve 
Niles. 

So he looked at the girl with 
a new kind of unconcern. How 
could she help his plans? Or 
hinder them? The promises she 
made were too vague to be of 
any real use in the sad compli- 
cated world of politics. 

He just tried to enjoy her 
company and the strange place 
in which he found himself. 

The Gulf of Esperanza lay just 
within his vision. At the far 
horizon he could see the help- 
less tornadoes trying to writhe 
their way past the weather ma- 
chines which still functioned, at 
the expense of Beauregard, all 
along the coast from Ambiloxi 
to Mottile. He could see the 
shoreline choked with kelp, which 
had once been a cash crop and 
was now a nuisance. Ruined 
buildings in the distance were 
probably the leftovers of proc- 
essing plants; the artificial- 



looking coral castles obscured 
his view of them. 

A nd this house — how much 
sense did this house make? 

An undergirl, eerily wise, who 
herself admitted that she had 
obtained an unlawful amount of 
conditioning; a master who was 
a living corpse; a threat which 
could not even be mentioned 
freely within the house; a house- 
hold which seemed to have dis- 
placed the planetary govern- 
ment; a planetary government 
which the Instrumentality, for 
unfathomable reasons of its own, 
had let fall into ruin. Why? 
Why? 

The turtle-girl was looking at 
him. If he had been an art stu- 
dent, he would have said that 
she was giving him the tender, 
feminine and irrecoverably re- 
mote smile of a Madonna, but 
he did not know the motifs of 
the ancient pictures; he just 
knew that it was a smile charac- 
teristic of T’ruth herself. 

“You are wondering . .?” 
she said. 

He nodded, suddenly feeling 
miserable that mere words had 
come between them. 

“You are wondering why the 
Instrumentality let you come 
here?” 

He nodded again. 

“I don’t know either,” said she, 
reachirg out and taking his hand. 



ON THE STORM PLANET

His hand felt and looked like 
the hairy paw of a giant as she 
held his right hand with her two 
pretty, well-kept little-girl 
hands; but the strength of her 
eyes and the steadfastness of her 
voice showed that it was she who 
was giving the reassurance, not 
he. 

The child was helping him? 

The idea was outrageous, im- 
possible, true. 

It was enough to alarm him, to 
make him begin to pull his hand 
away again. She clutched him 
with tender strength, and he 
could not resist her. Again he 
had the feeling, which had grip- 
ped him so strongly when he 
first met her at the door of 



Beauregard and failed to kill 
her, that he had always known 
her and had always loved her. 
(Was there not some planet on 
which eccentric people believed 
a weird cult, thinking that hu- 
man beings were endlessly re- 
born with fragmentary recollec- 
tions of their own previous hu- 
man lives? It was almost like 
that here, now. He did not know 
the girl but he had always known 
her. He did not love the girl 
and yet he had loved her from 
the beginning of time.) 

Said she, so softly that it was 
almost a whisper: “Wait. Your 
death may come through that 
door pretty soon and I will tell 
you how to meet it. But before 



40 



GALAXY 




that, I have to show you the 
most beautiful thing in the 
world.” 

T^Vespite her little hand lying 
tenderly on his, Casher 
spoke irritably: “I’m tired of 
talking riddles here on Henriada. 
The Administrator gives me the 
mission of killing you and I fail 
in it. Then you promise me a 
battle and give me a good meal 
instead. Now you talk about the 
battle and start off with some 
other irrelevancy. You’re going 
to make me angry if you keep 
on and, and — ” he stammered 
at last — “and I get pretty use- 
less if I’m angry. If you want me 
to fight for you, let me know 



the fight and let me go do it 
now. I’m willing enough.” 

Her remote, kind half-smile 
did not waver. “Casher,” she 
said, “what I am going to show 
you is your most important wea- 
pon in the fight.” 

With her free left hand she 
tugged at the fine chain of a 
thin gold necklace. Some kind of 
jewelry came out of the top of 
her shift dress, where she had 
kept it hidden. It was the image 
of two pieces of wood with a 
man nailed to them. 

Casher stared and then he 
burst into hysterical laughter. 

“Now you’ve done it, ma’am,” 
he cried. “I’m no use to you or 
to anybody else. I know what 



ON THE STORM PLANET 



41 



mat is, and up to now I’ve just 
suspected it. It’s what the robot, 
rat and Copt agreed on when they 
went exploring back in Space 
Three. It’s the Old Strong Reli- 
gion. You’ve put it in my mind 
and now the next person who 
meets me will peep it and will 
wipe it out. Me too, probably, 
along with it. That’s no weapon. 
That’s a defeat. You’ve done me 
in. I knew the sign of the Fish 
a long time ago, but I had a 
chance of getting away with just 
that little bit.” 

“Casher!” she cried. “Casher! 
Get hold of yourself. You will 
know nothing about this before 
you leave Beauregard. You will 
forget. You will be safe.” 

He stood on his feet, not know- 
ing whether to run away, to 
laugh out loud, or to sit down 
and weep at the silly sad mis- 
fortune which had befallen him. 
To think that he himself had 
become brain-branded as a fana- 
tic — forever denied travel be- 
tween the stars — just because 
an undergirl had shown him an 
odd piece of jewelry! 

“It’s not as bad as you think,” 
said the little girl, and stood up 
too. Her face peered lovingly at 
Casher’s. “Do you think, Casher, 
that I am afraid?” 

“No,” he admitted. 

“You will not remember this, 
Casher. Not when you leave. I 
am not just the turtle-girl T’ruth. 



1 am also the imprint ol the 
citizen Agatha. Have you ever 
heard of her?” 

“Agatha Madigan?” He shook 
his head slowly. “No. I don’t see 
how . No, I’m sure that I 
never heard of her.” 

“Didn’t you ever hear the 
story of the Hechizera of Gon- 
falon?” 

Casher looked surprised. “Sure 
I saw it. It’s a play. A drama. 
It is said to be based on some 
legend of immemorial time. The 
‘space-witch’ they called her, and 
she conjured fleets out of noth- 
ing by sheer hypnosis. It’s an old 
story.” 

“Eleven hundred years isn’t so 
long,” said the girl. “Eleven 
hundred years, fourteen local 
months come next tonight.” 

“You weren’t alive eleven 
hundred years ago,” said Casher. 

TTe stood up from the remains 
of their meal and wandered 
over toward the window. That 
terrible piece of religious jewelry 
made him uncomfortable. He 
knew that it was against all laws 
to ship religion from world to 
world. What would he do, what 
could he do, now that he had ac- 
tually beheld an image of the 
God Nailed High? That was 
exactly the kind of contraband 
which the police and customs ro- 
bots of hundreds of worlds were 
looking for. 



42 



GALAXY 



The Instrumentality was easy 
about most tilings, but the trans- 
planting of religion was one of 
its hostile obsessions. Religions 
leaked from world to world any- 
how. It was said that sometimes 
even the underpeople and robots 
carried bits of religion through 
space, though this seemed im- 
probable. The Instrumentality 
left religion alone when it had 
a settled place on a single plan- 
et, but the Lords of the Instru- 
mentality themselves shunned 
other people’s devotional lives 
and simply took good care that 
fanaticism did not once more 
flare up between the stars, once 
again bringing wild hope and 
great death to all the man- 
kinds. 

And now, thought Casher, 
the Instrumentality has been 
good to me in its big impersonal 
collective way, but what will it 
do when my brain is on fire with 
forbidden knowledge? 

The girl’s voice called him. 

“I have the answer to your 
problem, Casher,” said she, “if 
you would only listen to me. I 
am the Hechizera of Gonfalon, 
at least I am as much as any 
one person can be printed on 
another. ” 

His jaw dropped as he turned 
back to her. “You mean that 
you, child, really are imprinted 
with this woman Agatha Madi- 
gan? Really imprinted?” 



“I have all her skills, Casher,” 
said the girl quietly, “and a few 
more which I have learned on 
my own.” 

“But I thought it was just a 
story!” said Casher. “If you’re 
that terrible woman from Gonfa- 
lon, you don’t need me. I’m quit- 
ting. Now.” 

Casher walked toward the door. 
Disgusted, finished, through. 
She might be a child, she might 
be charming, she might need 
help, but if she came from that 
terrible old story, she did not 
need him. 

“Oh, no you don’t,” said she. 

IX 

T Tnexpected, she took her place 
in the doorway, barring it. 
In her hand was the image of 
the man on the two pieces of 
wood. 

Ordinarily Casher would not 
have pushed a lady. Such was 
his haste that he did so this 
time. When he touched her, it 
was like welded steel ; neither 
her gown nor her body yielded 
a thousandth of a millimeter to 
his strong hand and heavy push. 

“And now what?” she asked 
gently. 

Looking back, he saw that the 
real T’ruth, the smiling girl- 
woman, still stood soft and real 
in the window. 

Deep within, he began to give

up; he had heard of hypnotists 
who could project, but he had 
never met anyone as strong as 
this. 

She was doing it, but how was 
she doing it? Or was she doing 
it? The operation could be sub- 
volitional. There might be some 
art carried over from her animal 
past which even her re-formed 
mind could not explain. Opera- 
tions too subtle, too primordial 
for analysis. Or skills which she 
used without understanding. 

“I project,” she said. 

“I see you do,” he replied 
glumly and flatly. 

“I do kinesthetics,” she said. 
His knife whipped out of his 
bootsheath and floated in the 
air in front of him. 

He snatched it out of the air 
instinctively. It wormed a little 
in his grasp, but the force on 
the knife was nothing more than 
he had felt when passing big 
magnetic engines. 

“I blind,” she said. The room 
went totally dark for him. 

“I hear,” he said, and prowled 
at her like a beast, going by his 
memory of the room and by the 
very soft sound of her breathing. 
He had noticed by now that the 
simulacrum of herself which she 
had put in the doorway did not 
make any sound at all, not even 
that of breathing. 

He knew that he was near her. 
His fingertips reached out for 



her shoulder or her throat. He 
did not mean to hurt her, mere- 
ly to show her that two could 
play at tricks. 

“I stun,” she said, and her 
voice came at him from all di- 
rections. It echoed from the ceil- 
ing, came from all five walls of 
the old odd room, from the open 
windows, from both the doors. 
He felt as though he were being 
lifted into space and turned 
slowly in a condition of weight- 
lessness. He tried to retain self- 
control, to listen for the one true 
sound among the many false 
sounds, to trap the girl by some 
outside chance. 

“I make you remember,” said 
her multiple echoing voice. 

For an instant he did not see 
how this could be a weapon, 
even if the turtle-girl had learn- 
ed all the ugly tricks of the Hech- 
izera of Gonfalon. 

But then he knew. 

T T e saw his uncle, Kuraf , again. 
*■ He saw his old apartments 
vividly around himself. Kuraf 
was there. The old man was piti- 
able, hateful, drunk, horrible; the 
girl on Kuraf’s lap laughed at 
him, Casher O’Neill, and she 
laughed at Kuraf too. Casher 
had once had a teenager’s pas- 
sionate concern with sex and at 
the same time he had a teen- 
ager’s dreadful fear of all the 
unstated, invisible implications 



44 



GALAXY 



of what the man-woman rela- 
tionship, gone sour, gone wrong, 
gone bad, might be. The present- 
moment Casher remembered the 
long-ago Casher, and as he spun 
in the web of T’ruth’s hypnotic 
powers he found himself back 
with the ugliest memory he had: 
The killings in the palace at 
Mizzer. 

The colonels had taken Kaheer 
itself, and they ultimately let 
Kuraf run away to the pleasure 
planet of Ttiolle. 

But Kuraf’s companions, who 
had debauched the old republic 
of the Twelve Niles, those peo- 
ple! They did not go. The sol- 
diers, stung to fury, had cut them 
down with knives. Casher 
thought of the blood sticky on 
the floors, blood gushing purple 
into the carpets, blood bright 
red and leaping like a fountain 
when a white throat ended its 
last gurgle, blood turning brown 
where handprints had left it on 
marble tables. The warm palace, 
long ago, had gotten the sweet 
sick stench of blood all the way 
through it. The young Casher 
had never known that people 
had so much blood inside them, 
or that so much could pour out 
on the perfumed sheets, the 
tables still set with food and 
drink, or that blood could creep 
across the floor in growing pools 
as the bodies of the dead yielded 
up their last few nasty sounds 



and their terminal muscular 
spasms. 

Before that day of Butchery 
had ended, one thousand, three 
hundred and eleven human 
bodies, ranging in age from two 
months to eighty-nine years, had 
been carried out of the palaces 
once occupied by Kuraf. Kuraf. 
under sedation, was waiting for 
a starship to take him to per- 
petual exile and Casher — Cash- 
er himself O’Neill! — was shak- 
ing the hand of Colonel Wedder, 
whose orders had caused all the 
blood. The hand was washed 
and the nails pared and clean- 
ed, but the cuff of the sleeve 
was still rimmed with the dry 
blood of some other human be- 
ing. Colonel Wedder either did 
not notice his own cuff, or he 
did not care. 

“Touch and yield!” said a girl- 
voice out of nowhere. 

Casher found himself on all 
fours in the room, his sight sud- 
denly back again, the room un 
changed, and T’ruth smiling. 

“I fought you,” she said. 

He did not trust himself to 
speak. 

He reached for his water-glass, 
looking at it closely to see if 
there were any blood on it. 

Of course not. Not here. Not 
this time, not this place. 

He pulled himself to his feet. 

The girl has sense enough not 
to help him. 



ON THE STORM PLANET 



45 



She stood there in her thin 
modest shift, looking very much 
like a wise female child, while 
he stood up and drank thirstily. 
He refilled the glass and drank 
again. 

Then, only then, did he turn 
to her and speak. “Do you do 
all that?” 

She nodded. 

“Alone. Without drugs or ma- 
chinery?” 

She nodded again. 

“Child,” he cried out, “you’re 
not a person! You’re a whole 
weapons system all by yourself. 
What are you, really. Who are 
you?” 

“I am the turtle child T’ruth,” 
she said, “and I am the loyal 
property and loving servant of 
my good master, the Mister and 
Owner Murray Madigan.” 

“Madame,” said Casher, “you 
are almost a thousand years old. 
I am at your service. I do hope 
you will let me go free later on. 
And especially, that you will 
take that religious picture out of 
my mind.” 

As Casher spoke, she picked 
a locket from the table. He did 
not notice it. It was an ancient 
watch or a little round box, 
swinging on a thin gold chain. 

“Watch this,” said the child, 
“if you trust me, and repeat what 
I then say.” 

(Nothing at all happened: 
nothing — anywhere.) 



/dasher said to her, “You’re 
^ making me dizzy, swinging 
that ornament. Put it back on. 
Isn’t that the one you were 
wearing?” 

“No, Casher, it isn’t.” 

“What were we talking about?” 
demanded Casher. 

“Something,” said she. “Don’t 
you remember?” 

“No,” said Casher brusquely. 
“Sorry, but I’m hungry again.” 
He wolfed down a sweet roll en- 
crusted with sugar and decor- 
ated with fruits. His mouth full, 
he washed the food down with 
water. At last he spoke to her. 
“Now what?” 

She had watched with timeless 
grace. 

“There’s no hurry, Casher. 
Minutes or hours, they don’t 
matter.” 

“Didn’t you want me to fight 
somebody after Gosigo left me 
here?” 

“That’s right,” she said, with 
terrible quiet. 

“I seem to have had a fight 
right here in this room.” He 
stared around stupidly. 

She looked around the room, 
very cool. “It doesn’t look as 
though anybody’s been fighting 
here, does it?” 

“There’s no blood here, no 
blood at all. Everything is clean.” 

“Pretty much so.” 

“Then why,” said Casher, 
“should I think I had a fight?”

GALAXY 



“This wild weather on Hen- 
riada sometimes upsets offworld- 
ers until they get used to it,” 
said T’ruth mildly. 

The old room with the golden- 
oak furniture swam around him. 
The world outside was strange 
with the sunlit marshes and wide 
bayous trailing off to the for- 
ever-thundering storm, just over 
the horizon, which lay beyond 
the weather machines. Casher 
shrugged and shivered. He look- 
ed straight at the girl. She stood 
erect and looked at him with the 
even regard of a reigning em- 
press. Her young budding breasts 
barely showed through the thin- 
ness of her shift; she wore gold- 
en flat-heeled shoes. Around her 
neck there was a thin gold chain, 
but the object on the chain hung 
down inside her dress. It excited 
him a little to think of her flat 
chest barely budding into wom- 
anhood. He had never been a 
man who had an improper taste 
for children, but there was some- 
thing about this person which 
was not child-like at all. 

And around the edge of his 
mind there flickered up hot little 
torments of memory. 

“Now I remember,” he cried, 
“you have me here to kill some- 
body. You are sending me into 
a fight.” 

“You are going to a fight, 
Casher. I wish I could send 
somebody else, not you, but you 



are the only person here strong 
enough to do the job.” 

Impasively he took her hand. 
The moment he touched her, she 
ceased to be a child or an un- 
derperson. She felt tendei and 
exciting, like the most desirable 
and important person he had 
ever known. His sister? But he 
had no sister. He felt he was 
himself terribly, unendurably 
important to her. He did not 
want to let her hand go, but 
she withdrew from his touch 
with an authority which no de- 
cent man could resist. 

“You must fight to the death, 
now, Casher,” she said, looking 
at him as evenly as might a 
troop commander examine a 
special soldier selected for a 
risky mission.

Tie nodded. He was bred of 
having his mind confused. 
He knew something had hap- 
pened to him after the forgetty, 
Gosigo, had left him at the front 
door, but he was not at all sure 
of what it was. 

They seemed to have had a 
sort of meal together in this 
room. He felt that he was in 
love with the child, though he 
knew that she was not even a 
human being. He remembered 
something about her living nine- 
ty thousand years and he re- 



ON THE STORM PLANET

membered something else about 
her having gotten the name and 
the skills of the greatest battle 
hypnotist of all history, the He- 
chizera of Gonfalon. There was 
something strange, something 
frightening about that chain 
around her neck. There were 
things he had hoped he would 
never have to know. 

He strained at the thought and 
it broke like a bubble. 

“I’m a fighter,” he said. “Give 
me my fight and let me know.” 
“He can kill you. I hope not 
. but you must not kill him. 
He is immortal and insane; but 
in the law of Old North Aus- 
tralia, from which my master, 
the Mister and Owner Murray 
Madigan, is an exile, we must 
not hurt a house guest, nor may 
we turn him away in a time of 
great need.” 

“What do I do?” snapped 
Casher impatiently. 

“You fight him. Frighten him 
Make his poor crazy mind fear- 
ful that he will meet you again.” 
“I’m supposed to do this?” 
“You can,” she said very ser- 
iously. “I’ve already tested you. 
That’s why you have the little 
spot of amnesia about this 
room.” 

“But why? Why bother? Why 
not get some of your human ser- 
vants and have them tie him up 
or put him in a padded room?” 
“They can’t deal with him. He 



is too strong, too big, too clever, 
even though insane. Beside*, 
they don’t dare fdllow him.” 
“Where does he go?” said 
Casher sharply. 

“Into the control room,” re- 
plied T’ruth, as if it were the 
saddest phrase ever uttered. 

“What’s wrong with that? 
Even a place as fine as Beaure- 
gard can’t have too much of a 
control room. Put locks on the 
control.” 

“It’s not that kind of a con- 
trol room.” 

Almost angry, he shouted, 
“Whal is it, then?” 

“The control room,” she an- 
swered, “is for a planoform ship. 
This house — These counties, all 
the way to Mottile on the one 
side and to Ambiloxi on the oth- 
er — The sea itself, way out into 
the Gulf of Esperanza. All this 
is one ship.” 

Casher’s professional interest 
took over. “If it’s turned off, he 
can’t do any harm.” 

“It’s not turned off,” she said. 
“My master leaves it on a very 
little bit. That way, he can keep 
Ae weather machines going and 
make this edge of Henriada a 
very pleasant place.” 

tC'\/ r ou mean,” said Casher, 
“that you’d risk letting 
a lunatic fly all these estates off 
into space.” 

“He doesn’t even fly.” 



48 



GALAXY 



“What does he do, then?” 
yelled Casher. 

“When he gets at the con- 
trols, he just hovers.” 

“He hovers? By the Bell, girl, 
don’t try to fool me. If you 
hover a place as big as this, 
you could wipe out the whole 
planet any moment. There have 
been only two or three pilots in 
the history of space who would 
be able to hover a machine like 
this one.” 

“He can, though,” insisted the 
little girl. 

“Who is he, anyhow?” 

“I thought you knew. His name 
is John Joy Tree.” 

“Tree the Go-Captain?” Cash- 
er shivered in the warm room. 
“He died a long time ago after 
he made that record flight.” 
“He did not die. He bought 
immortality and went mad. He 
came here and he lives under 
my master’s protection.” 

“Oh,” said Casher. There was 
nothing else he would say. John 
Joy Tree, the great Norstrilian 
who took the first of the Long 
Plunges outside the galaxy; he 
was like Magno Taliano of ages 
ago, who could fly space on his 
living brain alone. 

But fight him? 

How could anybody fight 
him? 

Pilots are for piloting; killers 
are for killing; women are for 
loving or forgetting. When you 



mix up the purposes, everything 
goes wrong. 

Casher went down abruptly. 
“Do you have any more of that 
coffee?” 

“You don’t need coffee,” she 
said. 

He looked up inquiringly. 

“You’re a fighter. You need 
a war. That’s it,” she said, point- 
ing with her girlish hand to a 
small doorway which looked like 
the entrance to a closet. “Just 
go in there. He’s in there now, 
tinkering with the machines 
again. Making me wait for my 
master to get blown to bits at 
any minute! And I’ve put up 
with it for over a hundred 
years.” 

“Go yourself,” he said. 

“You’ve been in a ship’s con- 
trol room,” she declared. 

“Yes,” he nodded. 

“You know how people go all 
naked and frightened inside. You 
know how much training it 
takes to make a go-captain. What 
do you think happens to me?” 
At long last, her voice was shrill, 
angry, excited, childish. 

“What happens?” said Casher 
dully, not caring very much; 
he felt weary in every bone. 
Useless battles, murder he had 
to try, dead people arguing after 
their ballads had already grown 
out of fashion. Why didn’t the 
Hechizera of Gonfalon do her 
own work? 



ON THE STORM PLANET 



/9 



Catching his thought she 
screeched at him, “Because I 
can't!” 

“All right,” said Casher. “Why 
not?” 

“Because I turn into me.” 

A little startled, Casher said, 
“You what?” 

“I’m a turtle child. My shape 
is human. My brain is big. But 
I’m a turtle. No matter how 
much my master needs me, I’m 
just a turtle.” 

“What’s that got to do with 
it?” 

“What do turtles do when 
they’re faced with danger? Not 
underpeople-turtles, but real 
turtles, little animals. You must 
have heard of them somewhere.” 
“I’ve seen them,” said Casher, 
“on some world or other. They 
pull into their shells.” 

“That’s why I do,” she wept, 
“when I sould be defending my 
master. I can meet most things. 
I am not a coward. But in that 
control room, I forget, forget!” 
“Send a robot, then!” 

She almost screamed at him. 
“A robot against John Joy Tree? 
Are you mad, too?” 

Casher admitted, in a mumble, 
that on second thought it 
wouldn’t do much good to send 
a robot against the greatest go- 
captain of them all. He con- 
cluded lamely, “I’ll go, if you 
want me to.” 



“Go now,” she shouted. “Go 
right in!” 

She pulled at his arm, half- 
dragging and half-leading him to 
the little brightened door which 
looked so innocent. 

“But — ” he said. 

“Keep going,” she hissed. 
“This is all we ask of you. Don’t 
kill him, but frighten him, fight 
him, wound him if you must. 
You can do it. I can’t.” She 
sobbed as she tugged at him. 
“I’d just be me.” 

Before he knew quite what 
had happened she opened the 
door. The light beyond was clear 
and light and tinged with blue, 
the way the skies of Manhome, 
Mother Earth, were shown in 
all the viewers. 

He let her push him in through 
the door. 

He heard the door click be- 
hind him. 

Before he even took in the 
details of the room or noticed 
the man in the go-captain’s 
chair, the flavoring and mean- 
ing of the room struck him like 
a blow against his throat. 

This room, he thought, is hell. 

He wasn’t even sure that he 
remembered where he had 
learned the word “hell.” It de- 
noted all good turned to evil, 
all hope to anxiety, all wishes 
to greed. 

Somehow, this room was it. 

And then . 



50 



GALAXY 



XI 



A nd then the chief occupant 
of hell turned and looked 
squarely at him. 

If this was John Joy Tree, 
he did not look insane. 

He was a handsome, chubby 
man with a red complexion, 
bright eyes, dancing-blue in 
color, and a mouth which was as 
mobile as the mouth of a tempt- 
ress. 

“Good day.” 

“How do you do?” said Cash- 
er inanely. 

“I do not know your name,” 
said the ruddy brick man, speak- 
ing in a tone of voice which was 
not the least bit insane. 

“I am Casher O’Neill, from the 
city of Kaheer on the planet 
Mizzer.” 

“Mizzer?” laughed John Joy 
Tree. “I spent a night there, 
long, long ago. The entertain- 
ment was most unusual. But we 
have other things to talk about. 
You have come here to kill the 
undergirl T’ruth. You received 
your orders from the honorable 
Rankin Meiklejohn, may he 
soak in drink! The child has 
caught you and now she wants 
you to kill me, but she does 
not dare utter those words.” 

John Joy Tree, as be spoke, 
shifted the spaceship controls 
to stand-by, and got ready to 
get out of his captain’s seat. 



Casher protested, “She said 
nothing about killing you. She 
said you might kill me.” 

“I might, at that.” The im- 
mortal pilot stood on the floor. 
He was a full head shorter than 
Casher but he was a strong and 
formidable man. The blue light 
of the room made him look 
clear, sharp, distinct. 

The whole flavor of the situa- 
tion tickled the fear-nerves in- 
side Casher’s body. He sudden- 
ly felt that he wanted very 
much to go to a bathroom, but 
he felt quite surely that if he 
turned his back on this man, 
in this place, he would die like a 
felled ox in a stockyard. He had 
to face John Joy Tree. 

“Go ahead,” said the pilot. 
“Fight me.” 

“I didn’t say that I would 
fight you,” said Casher. “I am 
supposed to frighten you and I 
do not know how to do it.” 

“This isn’t getting us any- 
where,” said John Joe Tree. 
“Shall we go into the outer room 
and let poor little T’ruth give us 
a drink? You can just tell her 
that you failed.” 

“I think,” said Casher, “that 
I am more afraid of her than I 
am of you.” 

John Joy Tree flung himself 
into a comfortable passenger’s 
chair. “AH right, then. Do some- 
thing. Do you want to box? 
Glover? Bare fists? Or would 



ON THE STORM PLANET 



51 



you like swords? Or wirepoints? 
There are some over there in the 
closet. Or we can each take a 
pilot ship and have a ship-duel 
out in space.” 

“That wouldn’t make much 
sense,” said Casher, “me fight- 
ing a ship against the greatest 
go-captain of them all.” 

John Joy Tree greeted this 
with an ugly underlaugh, a bare- 
ly audible sound which made 
Casher feel the whole situation 
was ridiculous. 

“But I do have one advan- 
tage,” said Casher. “I know who 
you are and you do not know 
who I am.” 

“How could I tell,” said John 
Joy Tree, “when people keep 
on getting born all over the 
place?” 

He gave Casher a scornful, 
comfortable grin. There was 
charm in the man’s poise. Keep- 
ing his eyes focused directly on 
Casher, he felt for a carafe and 
poured himself a drink. 

He gave Casher an ironic 
toast and Casher took it, stand- 
ing frightened and alone. More 
alone than he had ever been be- 
fore in his life. 

Suddenly John Joy Tree sprang 
^ lightly to his feet and stared 
with a complete change of ex- 
pression past Casher. Casher did 
not dare look around. This was 
some old fighting trick. 



Tree spat out the words, 
“You’ve done it then! This time 
you will violate all the laws and 
kill me. This fashionable oaf is 
not just one more trick.” 

A voice behind Casher called 
softly, “I don’t know.” It was a 
man’s voice, old, slow and tired. 

Casher had heard no one come 
in. 

Casher’s years of training 
stood him in good stead. He 
skipped sidewise in four or five 
steps, never taking his eyes off 
John Joy Tree, until the other 
man had come into his field of 
vision. 

The man who stood there was 
tall, thin, yellow-skinned and 
yellow-haired. His eyes were an 
old sick blue. He glanced at 
Casher and said: 

“I’m Madigan.” 

Was this the master? thought 
Casher. Was this the being 
whom that lovely child had 
been imprinted to adore? 

He had no more time for 
thought. 

Madigan whispered, as if to no 
one in particular, “You find me 
waking. You find him sane. 
Watch out.” 

Madigan lunged for the pilot’s 
controls, but his tall, thin old 
body could not move very fast. 

John Joy Tree jumped out 
of his chair and ran for the con- 
trols too. 

Casher tripped him. 



52 



GALAXY 



Tree fe 1 !, rolled over, and got 
halfway up, one knee and one 
foot on the floor. In his hand 
there shimmered a knife very 
much like Casher’s own. 

Casher felt the flame of his 
body as some unknown force 
flung him against the wall. He 
stared, wild with fear. 

Madigan had climbed into the 
pilot’s seat and was fiddling with 
the controls as though he might 
blow Henriada out of space at 
any second. John Joy Tree 
glanced at his old host and then 
turned his attention to the man 
in front of him. 

There was another man there. 

Casher knew him. 

He looked familiar. 

It was himself, rising and leap- 
ing like a snake, left arm weav- 
ing the knife for the neck of 
John Joy Tree. 

The image-Casher hit Tree 
with a . thud that resounded 
through the room. 

Tree’s bright blue eyes had 
turned crazy-mad. His knife 
caught the image-Casher in the 
abdomen, thrust hard and deep, 
and left the young man gasping 
on the floor, trying to push the 
bleeding entrails back into his 
belly. The blood poured from 
the image-Casher all over the 
rug. 

Blood! 

Casher suddenly knew what he 
had to do and how he could do 



it — all without anybody telling 
him. 

TTe created a third Casher on 
the far side of the room 
fid gave him iron gloves. There 
was himself, unheeded against 
the wall; there was the dying 
Casher on the floor; there was 
the third, stalking toward John 
Joy Tree. 

“Death is here,” screamed the 
third Casher, with a voice which 
Casher recognized as a fierce 
crazy simulacrum of his own. 

Tree whirled around. “You’re 
not real,” he said. 

Image-Casher stepped around 
the console and hit Tree with an 
iron glove. The pilot jumped 
away, a hand reaching up to his 
bleeding face. 

John Joy Tree screamed at 
Madigan, who was playing with 
the dials without even putting on 
the pinlighter helmet. 

“You got her in here?” he 
screamed. “You got her in here 
with this young man! Get her 
out!” 

“Who?” said Madigan softly 
and absentmindedly. 

“T’ruth. That witch of yours. 
I claim guest-right by all the 
ancient laws. Get her out.” 

The real-Casher, standing at 
the wall, did not know how he 
controlled the image-Casher with 
the iron gloves, but control him 
he did. He made him speak, in 



ON THE STORM PLANET 



53 



a voice as frantic as Tree’s own 
voice: 

“John Joy Tree, I do not bring 
you death. I bring you blood. 
My iron hands will split your 
eyes. Blind sockets will stare in 
your face. My iron hands will 
split your teeth and break your 
jaw a thousand times, so that 
no doctor, no machine will ever 
fix you. My iron hands will 
crush your arms, turn your hands 
into living rags. My iron hands 
will break your legs. Look at the 
blood, John Joy Tree! There will 
be a lot more blood. You have 
killed me once. See that young 
man on the floor.” 

They both glanced at the first 
image- Casher, who had finally 
shuddered into death in the great 
rug. A pool of blood lay in front 
of the body of the youth. 

John Joy Tree turned to the 
image-Casher and said to him, 
“You’re the Hechizera of Gon- 
falon. You can’t scare me. You’re 
a turtle- girl and can’t really hurt 
me.” 

“Look at me,” said real-Cash- 
er. 

John Joy Tree glanced back 
and forth between the dupli- 
cates. 

Fright began to show. 

Both the Cashers now shouted, 
in crazy voices which came from 
the depths of Casher’s own mind : 

“Blood you shall have! Blood 
and ruin. But we will not kill 



you. You will live in ruin, blind, 
emasculated, armless, legless. 
You will be fed through tubes. 
You cannot die and you will 
weep for death but no one will 
hear you.” 

“Why?” screamed Tree. 
“Why? What have I done to 
you?” 

“You remind me,” howled 
Casher, “of my home. You re- 
mind me of the blood poured 
by Colonel Wedder when the 
poor useless victims of my uncle’s 
lust paid with their blood for his 
revenge. You remind me of my- 
self, John Joy Tree, and I am 
going to punish you as I myself 
might be punished.” 

T ost in the mists of lunacy, 
^ — John Joy Tree was still a 
brave man. 

He flung his knife unexpected- 
ly at real-Casher. Image-Casher, 
in a tremendous bound, leaped 
across the room and caught the 
knife on an iron glove. It clat- 
tered against the iron glove and 
then fell silent into the rug. 

Casher saw what he had to 
see. 

He saw the place of Kaheer, 
covered with death, with the 
intimate sticky silliness of sud- 
den death — the dead men hold- 
ing little packages they had tried 
to save, the girls, with their 
throats cut, lying in their own 
blood but with the lipstick still 



54 



GALAXY 



even and the eyebrow-pencil still 
pretty on their dead faces. He 
saw a dead child holding a brok- 
en doll, looking like a broken 
doll itself. He saw these things 
and he made John Joy Tree see 
• them too. 

“You’re a bad man.” said John 
Joy Tree. 

“I am very bad,” said Casher. 

“Will you let me go, if I never 
enter this room again?” 

Image-Casher snapped off, 
both the body on the floor and 
the fighter with the iron gloves. 
Casher did not know how T’ruth 
had taught him the lost art of 
fighter-replication, but he had 
certainly done it well. 

“The lady told me you could 
go.” 

“But who are you going to 
use,” said John Joy Tree, calm, 
sad and logical, “for your dreams 
of blood if you don’t use me?” 

“I don’t know,” said Casher. 
“I follow my fate. Go now, if 
you do not want my iron gloves 
to crush you.” 

John Joy Tree trotted ou'; of 
the room, beaten. 

Only then did Casher, exhaust- 
ed, grab a curtain to hold him- 
self upright and look around the 
room freely. 

The evil atmosphere had gone. 

Madigan, old though he was, 
had locked all the controls on 
stand-by. 

He walked over to Casher. 



“Thank you. She did not in- 
vent you. She found you and put 
you to my service.” 

Casher coughed out, “The girl. 
Yes.” 

“My girl,” corrected Madigan. 
“She could not have thought 
you up. She is my dead wife 
over again. The citizeness Agatha 
might have done it. But not 
T’ruth.” 

Casher looked at the man as 
he talked. The host wore the 
bottoms of some very cheap yel- 
low pajamas and a washable 
bathrobe which had once been 
stripes of purple, lavender and 
white. Now it was faded, like 
its wearer. Casher also saw the 
white clean plastic surgical im- 
plants on the man’s arms, where 
the machines and tubes hooked 
in to keep him alive. 

“I sleep a lot,” said Murray 
Madigan, “but I am still the 
master of Beauregard. I am 
grateful to you.” 

The hand was frail, withered, 
dry, without strength. 

The old voice whispered: 
“Tell her to reward you. You 
can have anything on my estate. 
Or you can have anything on 
Henriada. She manages it all for 
me.” Then the old blue eyes 
opened wide and sharp and Mur- 
ray Madigan was once again the 
man, just momentarily, that he 
had been hundreds of years ago 
— a Norstrilian trader, sharp, 



ON THE STORM PLANET 



59 



shrewd, wise and not unkind. He 
added sharply: “Enjoy her com- 
pany. She is a good child. But do 
not try to take her.” 

“Why not?” said Casher, sur- 
prised at his own bluntness. 

“Because if you do, she will 
die. She is mine. Imprinted to 
me. I had her made and she is 
mine. Without me she would die 
in a few days. Do not take her.” 
Casher saw the old man leave 
the room by a secret door. He 
left himself, the way he had 
come in. He did not see Madigan 
again for two days, and by that 
time the old man had gone far 
back into his cataleptic sleep. 

XII 

'T'wo days later T’ruth took 
Casher to visit the sleeping 
Madigan. 

“You can’t go in there,” said 
Eunice in a shocked voice “ No- 
body goes in there. That’s the 
master’s room.” 

“I’m taking him in,” said 
T’ruth calmly. 

She had pulled a cloth-of-gold 
curtain aside and she was spin- 
ning the combination locks on a 
massive steel door. It was set in 
Daimoni material. 

The maid went on protesting, 
“But even you, little ma’am, 
can’t take him in there!” 

“Who says I can’t?” said 
T’ruth calmly and challengingly. 



The awfulness of the situation 
sank in on Eunice. 

In a small voice she muttered, 
“If you’re taking him in, you’re 
taking him in, but it’s never been 
done before.” 

“Of course it hasn’t Eunice, 
not in your time. But Casher 
O’Neill has already met the mis- 
ter and owner. He has fought for 
the mister and owner. Do you 
think I would take a stray guest 
in to look at the master, just 
like that?” 

“Oh, not at all, no,” said Eu- 
nice. 

“Then go away, woman,” said 
the lady-child. “You don’t want 
to see this door open, do you?” 

“Oh, no,” shrieked Eunice and 
fled, putting her hands over her 
ears as though that would shut 
out the sight of the door. 

When the maid had disappear- 
ed, T’ruth pulled with her whole 
weight against the handle of the 
heavy door. Casher expected the 
mustiness of the tomb or the 
medicine-smell of a hospital: he 
was astonished when fresh air 
and warm sunlight poured out 
from that heavy, mysterious 
door. The actual opening was so 
narrow, so low, that Casher had 
to step sidewise as he followed 
T’ruth into the room. 

The master’s room was enor- 
mous. The windows were flood- 
ed with perpetual sunlight. The 
landscape outside must have 



56 



GALAXY 



been the way Henriada loaded 
in its prime, when Mottile was a 
resort for the carefree millions 
of vacationers and Ambiloxi a 
port feeding worlds halfwav 
across the galaxy. There was no 
sign of the ugly snaky storms 
which worried and pestered Hen- 
riada in these later years. Every- 
thing was landscape, order, neat- 
ness, the triumph of man, as 
though Turner had painted it. 

nphe room itself, like the other 
-*• great living-room of the es- 
tate of Beauregard, was an exu- 
berant neo-baroque in which the 
architect, himself half-mad, had 
been given wild license to work 
out his fantasies in steel, plastic, 
plaster, wood and stone. The 
ceiling was not flat: it had a 
nave. The four comers of the 
room were each alcoves, cutting 
deep into the four sides, so that 
the room was in effect an octa- 
gon. The propriety and pretti- 
ness of the room had been a 
little diminished by the shoving 
of the furniture to one side, 
sofas, upholstered armchairs, 
marble tables and knicknack 
stands all in an indescribable 
melange to the left, while the 
right hand part of the room, 
facing the master window with 
the illusory landscape, was 
equipped like a surgery with an 
operating table, hydraulic lifts, 
bottles of clear and colored fluid 



hanging from chrome stands and 
two large devices which (Casher 
later surmised) must have been 
heart-lung and kidney machines. 

The alcoves, in their turn, 
were wilder. One was an archaic 
funeral parlor with an immense 
coffin, draped in black velvet, 
resting on a heavy teak stand. 
The next was a spaceship con- 
trol cabin of the oM kind, with 
the levers, switches and con- 
trols all in plain sight — the met- 
ers: actually read the galactically- 
stable location of this very place, 
and to do so they had to whirl 
mightily — as well as a pilot’s 
chair with the usual choice of 
helmets and the straps and shock 
absorbers. The third alcove was 
a simple bedroom done in very 
old-fashioned taste, the walls a 
Wedgewood blue with deep wine- 
colored drapes, coverlets and 
pillowcases marking a sharp but 
tolerable contrast. The fourth al- 
cove was the copy of a fortress. 
It might even be a fortress; the 
door was heavy and the walls 
looked as though they might be 
Daimoni material, indestructible 
by any imaginable means. Cases 
of emergency food and water 
were stacked against the walls. 
Weapons which looked oiled and 
primed stood in their racks, to- 
gether with three different cali- 
bers of wirepoint. 

The alcoves had no people in 
them.

The parlor was deserted. 

The mister and owner Murray 
Madigan lay naked on the oper- 
ating table. Two ox three wires 
led to gauges attached to his 
body. Casher thought that he 
could see a faint motion of toe 
chest, as the cataleptic man 
breathed at a rate one-tenth 
normal or less. 

The girl-lady, T’ruth, was not 
the least embarrassed. 

“1 check him four or five times 
a day. I never let people in 
here. But you’re special, Cash- 
er. He’s talked with you and 
fought beside you and he knows 
that he owes you his life. You’re 
the first human person ever to 
get into this room.” 

“I’ll wager,” said Casher, “that 
the Administrator of Henriada, 
the Honorable Rankin Meikle- 
john, would give up some of his 
‘honorable’ just to get in here 
and have one look around. He 
wonders what Madigan is doing 
when Madigan is doing nothing.” 
“He’s not just doing nothing,” 
said T’ruth sharply. “He’s sleep- 
ing. It’s not everybody who can 
sleep for forty or fifty or sixty 
thousand years and can wake up 
a few times a month, just to see 
how things are going.” 

Casher started to whistle and 
then stopped himself, as though 
he feared to waken the uncon- 
scious, naked old man. “So that’s 
why he chose you.” 



r T'' , ruth corrected him as she 
washed her hands vigorously 
in a wash-basin. “That’s why he 
had me made. Turtle stock, 
three hundred years. Multiply 
that with intensive stroon treat- 
ments, three hundred times. 
Ninety thousand years. Then he 
had me printed to love him and 
adore him. He’s not my master, 
you know. He’s my god.” 

“Your what?” 

“You heard me. Don’t get up- 
set. I’m not going to give you 
any illegal memories. I worship 
him. That’s what I was printed 
for, when my little turtle eyes 
opened and they put me back in 
the tank to enlarge my brain and 
to make a woman out of me. 
That’s why they printed every 
memory of the citizeness Agatha 
Madigan right into my brain. 
I’m what he wanted. Just what 
he wanted. I’m the most wanted 
being on any planet. No wife, 
no sweetheart, no mother has 
ever been wanted as much as he 
wants me now, when he wakes 
up and knows that I am still 
here. You’re a smart man. Would 
you trust any machine — any 
machine at all — for ninety thou- 
sand years?” 

“It would be hard,” said Cash- 
er, “to get batteries of monitors 
long enough for them to repair 
each other over that long a time. 
But that means you have ninety 
thousand years of it. Four times, 



58 



GALAXY 



five times a day. I can’t even 
multiply the numbers. Don’t you 
ever get tired of it?” 

“He’s my love, he’s my joy, 
he’s my darling little boy,” she 
carolled, as she lifted his eye- 
lids and put colorless drops in 
each eye. Absentmindedly she 
explained, “With this slow a 
metabolism, there’s always some 
danger that the eyelids will stick 
to his eyeballs. This is part of 
the checkup.” 

She tilted the sleeping man’s 
head, looked earnestly into each 
eye. Then she stepped a few 
paces aside and put her face 
close to the dial of a gently hum- 
ming machine. There was the 
sound of a shot. Casher almost 
reached for his gun, which he 
did not have. 

The child turned back to him 
with a mischievous smile. “Sorry, 
I should have warned you. That’s 
my noisemaker. I watch the en- 
cephalograph to make sure his 
brain keeps a little auditory in- 
take. It showed up with the 
noise. He’s asleep, very deeply 
asleep, but he’s not drifting 
downward into death.” 

Back at the table she pushed 
Madigan’s chin upward so that 
the head leaned far back on its 
neck. Deftly holding the fore- 
head, she took a retractor, open- 
ed his mouth with her fingers, 
depressed the tongue and looked 
down into the throat. 



“No accumulations there,” she 
muttered, as if to herself. 

She pushed the head back 
into a comfortable position. She 
seemed on the edge of another 
set of operations when it was ob- 
vious that an idea occurred to 
her. “Go wash your hands, thor- 
oughly, over there, at the basin. 
Then push the timer down and 
be sure you hold your hands 
under the sterilizer until the 
timer goes off. You can help me 
turn him over. I don’t have help 
here. You’re the first visitor.” 

Casher obeyed and while he 
washed his hands he saw the girl 
drench her hands with some flow- 
er-scented unguent. She began 
to massage the unconscious body 
with professional expertness, 
even with a degree of rough- 
ness. As he stood with his hands 
under the sterilizer-drier, Casher 
marvelled at the strength of 
those girlish arms and those little, 
hands. Indefatigably they strok 
ed, rubbed, pummelled, pulled, 
stretched and poked the old 
body. The sleeping man seemed 
to be utterly unaware of it but 
Casher thought that he could see 
a better skin color and muscle 
tone appearing. 

He walked back to the table 
and stood facing T’ruth. 

A huge peacock walked across 
the imaginary lawn outside the 
window, his tail shimmering in a 
paroxysm of colors.

'T^’ruth saw the direction of 
A Casher’s glance. 

“Oh, I program that too. He 
likes it when he wakes up. Don't 
you think he was clever, before 
he went into catalepsis, to have 
me made? To have me created 
to love him and to care for him? 
It helps that I’m a girl. I can’t 
ever love anybody but him, and 
it’s easy for me to remember that 
this is the man I love. And it’s 
safer for him. Any man might get 
bored with these responsibilities. 
I don’t.” 

“Yet — ” said Casher. 

“Shh,” she said, “wait a bit. 
This takes care.” Her strong 
little fingers were now plowing 
deep into the abdomen of the 
naked old man. She closed her 
eyes so that she could concen- 
trate all her senses on the one 
act of tactile impression. She 
took her hands away and stood 
erect. “All clear,” she said. “I’ve 
got to find out what’s going on 
inside him. But I don’t dare use 
X-rays on him. Think of the ra- 
diation he’d build up in a hun- 
dred years or so. Here, now. You 
can help me turn him over, but 
watch the wires. Those are the 
monitor controls. They report 
his physiological processes, radio 
a message to me if anything 
goes wrong, and meanwhile sup- 
ply the missing neurophysical 



impulses if any part of the auto- 
matic nervous system began to 
fade out or just simply went off.” 
“Has that ever happened?” 
“Never,” she said, “not yet. 
But I’m ready. Watch that wire 
— you’re turning him too fast 
There now, that’s right. You 
can stand back while I massage 
him on the back.” 

She went back to her job of 
being a masseuse. Starting at the 
muscles joining the skull to the 
neck, she worked her way down 
the body, pouring ointment on 
her hands from time to time. 
When she got to his legs she 
seemed to work particularly hard. 
She lifted the feet, bent the 
knees, slapped the calves. 

Her face cleared. “He’s all 
right. He’ll get along well for the 
next two hours. I’ll have to give 
him a little sugar then. All he’s 
getting now is normal saline.” 
She stood facing him. There 
was a faint glow in her cheeks 
from the violent exercise in 
which she had been indulging, 
but she still looked both the 
child and the lady — the child 
irrecoverably remote, hidden in 
her down wisdom from the mud- 
dled world of adults, and the 
lady, mistress in her own home, 
her own estates, her own planet, 
serving her master with almost 
immortal love. 

“I was going to ask you, back 
there — ■ ” Casher started. 



60 



GALAXY 



“You were going to ask me?” 
He spoke heavily. “I was going 
to ask you, what happens to you 
when he dies?” 

“I couldn’t care less,” her voice 
sang out. He could see by the 
open, honest smile on her face 
that she meant it. “I’m his. I 
belong to him. That’s what I’m 
for.” 

She passed Casher, almost 
pulled herself clear of the floor 
tugging on the great inside lev- 
ers of the main door. 

She gestured him past. He 
stooped and stepped through. 

“Turn away again,” she said. 
“All I’m going to do is to spin 
the dials, but they’re cued to 
give any viewer a bad headache 
so he will forget the combina- 
tion. Even robots. I’m the only 
person tuned to these doors.” 

He heard the dials spinning 
but he did not look around. 

She murmured, almost under 
her breath, “I’m the only one. 
The only one.” 

nphey proceeded down a corri- 
-*• dor, forgotten pictures hang- 
ing on the walls, unremembered 
luxuries left untouched by cen- 
turies of neglect. 

The bright yellow light of Hen- 
riada poured in through an open 
doorway on their right. It must 
be a room, thought Casher, with 
its window open. 

From the room came snatches 



of a man singing while playing 
a stringed instrument. Later, 
Casher found that this was a 
verse of the Henriada Song, the 
one which went: 

Don’t put your ship in the 
Boom Lagoon, 

Look up North for the raving 
wave. 

Henriada’s boiled away 

But Ambiloxi’s a saving grave. 

They entered the room. 

A gentleman stood up to greet 
them. It was the great go-pilot, 
John Joy Tree. His ruddy face 
smiled, his bright blue eyes lit 
up, a little condescendingly, as 
he greeted his small hostess, but 
then his glance took in Casher 
O’Neill. 

The effect was sudden, and 
evil. 

John Joy Tree looked away 
from both of them. The phrase 
which he had started to use 
stuck in his throat. 

He said, in a different voice, 
very “away” and deeply trou- 
bled, “There is blood all over this 
place. There is a man of blood 
right here. Excuse me. I am 
going to be sick.” 

He trotted past them and out 
the door which they had enter- 
ed. 

“You have passed a test,” said 
T’ruth. “Your help to my master 
has solved the problem of the 



ON THE STORM PLANET 



61 



captain and honorable John Joy 
Tree. He will not go near that 
control room if he thinks that 
you are there.” 

“Do you have more tests for 
me? Still more? By now, you 
ought to know me well enough 
not to need tests.” 

“I am not a person,” she said, 
“but just a built-up copy of 
one. I am getting ready to give 
you your weapon. This is a com- 
munications room as well as a 
music room. Would you like 
something to eat or drink?” 

“Just water,” he said. 

“At your hand,” said T’ruth. 
A rock-crystal carafe had been 
standing on the table beside him, 
unnoticed. Or had she trans- 



ported it into the room with one 
of the tricks of the Hechizera, 
the dreaded Agatha herself? It 
didn’t matter. He drank. Trouble 
was coming. 

XIV 

r T^Tuth had swung open a pol- 
ished cabinet panel. The 
communicator was the kind they 
mount in pianoforming ships 
right beside the pilot. The rental 
on one of them was enough to 
make any planetary government 
reconsider its annual budget. 
“That’s yours?” cried Casher. 
“Why not?” said the little-girl 
lady. “I have four or five.” 

“But you’re rich!” 



62 



GALAXY 




“I’m not. My master is. I be- 
long to my master, too.” 

“But things like this. He can’t 
handle them. How does he man- 
age?” 

“You mean money and 
things?” The girlish part of her 
came out. She looked pleased, 
happy and mischievous. “I man- 
age them for him. He was the 
richest man on Henriada when I 
came here. He had credits of 
stroon. Now he is about forty 
times richer.” 

“He’s a Rod McBan!” cried 
Casher. 

“No, not even near. Mister 
McBan had a lot more money 
than we. But he’s rich. Where 
do you think all the people from 



Henriada went?” 

“I don’t know,” said Casher. 

“To four new planets. The? 
belong to my master and he 
charges the new settlers a very 
small land-rent.” 

“You bought them?” said 
Casher, 

“For him,” smiled T’rutk 
“Haven’t you heard of planet- 
brokers?” 

“But that’s a gambler’s busi- 
ness!” said Casher. 

“I gambled,” she said, “and 
I won. Now keep quiet and watch 
me.” 

She pressed a button. “Instant 
message.” 

“Instant message,” repeated 
the machine. “What priority?” 



ON THE STORM PLANET 



63 




"War news, double A one, sub- 
space penalty.” 

“Confirmed,” said the ma- 
chine. 

“The planet Mizzer. Now. 
War and peace information. Will 
fighting end soon?” 

The machine clucked to itself. 
Casher, knowing the prices of 
this kind of communication, al- 
most felt that he could see the 
artificial spurt of money go out 
Of Henriada’s budget as the 
machines reached across the gal- 
axy, found Mizzer and came 
back with the answer. 

“Skirmishing. Seventh Nile. 
Ends three local days.” 

“Close message,” said T’ruth. 
The machine went off. 

T’ruth turned to him. “You’re 
going home soon, Casher, if you 
can pass a few little tests.” 

He stared at her and blurted, 
“I need my weapons, my cruiser 
and my laser.” 

“You’ll have weapons. Better 
ones than those. Right now, I 
want you to go to the front door. 
When you have opened the door, 
you will not let anybody in. 
Close the door. Then please come 
back to me here, dear Casher, 
and if you are still alive, I will 
have some other things for you 
to do.” 

/dasher turned in bewilderment. 
^ It did not occur to him to 
contradict her. He could end up 

64 



a forgetty, like the maidservant 
Eunice or the Administrator’s 
brown man, Gosigo. 

Down the halls he walked. He 
met no one except for a few shy 
cleaning-robots who bowed their 
heads politely as he passed. 

He found the front door. It 
stopped him. It looked like wood 
on the outside but it was actually 
a Daimoni door, made of near- 
indestructible material. There 
was no sign of a key or dials or 
controls. Acting like a man in a 
dream, he took a chance that the 
door might be keyed to himself. 
He put his right palm firmly 
against it, at the left or opening 
edge. 

The door swung in. 

Meiklejohn was there. Gosigo 
held the Administrator upright. 
It must have been a rough trip. 
The Administrator’s face was 
bruised and there was a trickle 
of blood coming out of the cor- 
ner of his mouth. His eyes fo- 
cused on Casher. 

“You’re alive. She caught you 
too?” 

Quite formally, Casher asked, 
“What do you want in this 
house?” 

“I have come,” said the Ad- 
ministrator, “to see her.” 

“To see whom?” insisted 
Casher. 

The Administrator hung al- 
most slack in Gosigo’s arms. By 
his own standard and in his own 



GALAXY 



way, he was a very brave man 
indeed. His eyes looked clear 
even though his body was col- 
lapsing. 

“To see T’ruth, if she will see 
me,” said Rankin Meiklejohn. 

Said Casher, “She cannot see 
you now. Gosigo!” 

The forgetty turned to Casher 
and gave him a bow. 

“You will forget me. You 
have not seen me.” 

“I have not seen you, Lord. 
Give my greetings to your lady. 
Anything else?” 

“Yes. Take your master home, 
as safely and swiftly as you 
can.” 

“My lord!” cried Gosigo, 
though this was an improper title 
for Casher. Casher turned 
around. 

“My lord, tell her to extend 
the weather machines for just 
a few more kilometers and I will 
have him home safe in ten min- 
utes. At top speed.” 

“I can tell her,” said Casher, 
“but I cannot promise she will 
do it.” 

“Of course,” said Gosigo. He 
picked up the Administrator and 
began putting him into the 
ground car. Rankin Meiklejohn 
bawled once, like a man crying 
in paint. It sounded like a 
blurred version of the name 
Murray Madigan. No one heard 
it but for Gosigo and Casher; 
Gosigo busy closing the ground 



car, Casher pushing on the big 
house door. 

The door clicked. 

There was silence. 

The opening of the door was 
remembered only by the warm 
sweet salty stink of seaweed 
which had disturbed the odor- 
pattern of the changeless, musty 
old house. 

Casher hurried back with the 
message about the weather ma- 
chines. 

r Tp’ruth received the message 
* gravely. Without even look- 
ing at the console, she reached 
out and controlled it with her 
extended right hand while not 
taking her eyes off Casher for 
a moment. The machine clicked 
its agreement. T’ruth exhaled. 

“Thank you, Casher. Now the 
Instrumentality and the forget- 
ty are gone.” 

She stared at him, almost sad- 
ly and inquiringly. He wanted 
to pick her up, to crush her to 
his chest, to rain his kisses on 
her face. But he stood stock 
still. He did not move. This was 
not just the forever-loving turtle- 
child; this was the real mistress 
of Henriada. This was the Hech- 
izera of Gonfalon, whom he had 
formerly thought about only in 
terms of a wild, melodic grand 
opera. 

“I think you are seeing me, 
Casher. It is hard to see people, 



ON THE STORM PLANET 



65 



even when you look at them 
every day. I think I can see you, 
too, Casher. It is almost time for 
us both to do the things which 
we have to do.” 

“Which we have to do?” he 
whispered, hoping she might say 
something else. 

“For me, my work here on 
Henriada. For you, your fate on 
your homeland of Mizzer. That’s 
what life is, isn’t it? Doing what 
you have to do in the first place. 
We’re lucky people if we find 
it out. You are ready, Casher. 
I am about to give you weapons 
which will make bombs and 
cruisers and lasers and bombs 
seem like nothing at all.” 

“By the Bell, girl! Can’t you 
tell me what those weapons are?” 
T’ruth stood in her innocently 
revealing sheath, the yellow light 
of the old music room pouring 
like a halo around her. 

“Yes,” she said, “I can tell 
you now. Me.” 

Casher felt a wild surge of 
erotic attraction for the innocent- 
ly voluptuous child. He remem- 
bered his first insane impulse to 
crush her with kisses, to sweep 
her up with hugs, to exhaust her 
with all the excitement which his 
masculinity could bring to both 
of them. 

He looked. 

She stood there, calm. 

That sort of an idea did not 
ring right. 



He was going to get her, but 
he was going to get something 
far from fun or folly — some- 
thing, indeed, which he might 
not even like. 

TT7'hen at last he spoke, it was 
* ” out of the deep bewilder- 
ment of his own thoughts, “What 
do you mean, you’re going to 
give me yourself? It doesn’t 
sound very romantic to me, nor 
the tone in which you said it.” 

The child stepped close to him, 
reaching up and patting his fore- 
head. 

“You’re not going to get me 
for a night’s romance, and if you 
did, you would be sorry. I am 
the property of my master and 
no other man. But I can do 
something with you which I have 
never done to anyone else. I can 
get myself imprinted on you. 
The technicians are already 
coming. You will be the turtle 
child. You will be the citizeness 
Agatha Madigan, the Hechizera 
of Gonfalon herself. You will be 
many other people — and your- 
self. You will then win. Acci- 
dents may kill you, Casher, but 
no one will be able to kill you 
on purpose. Not when you’re 
me. Poor man! Do you know 
what you will be giving up?” 

“What?” he croaked, at the 
edge of a great fright. He had 
seen danger before, but never 
danger from within himself. 



66 



GALAXY 



“You will not fear death, ever 
again, Casher. You will have to 
lead your life minute by minute, 
second by second, and you will 
not have the alibi that you are 
going to die anyhow. You will 
know that’s not special.” 

He nodded, understanding her 
words and scrabbling around his 
mind for a meaning. 

“I’m a girl, Casher . 

He looked at her and his eyes 
widened. She was a girl — a 
beautiful, wonderful girl. But she 
was something more. She was 
the mistress of Henriada. She 
was the first of the underpeople 
really and truly to surpass hu- 
manity. To think that he had 
wanted to grab her poor little 
body. The body — ah, that was 
sweet! — but the power within it 
was the kind of thing that em- 
pires and religions are made of. 

. and if you take the print 
of me, Casher, you will never lie 
with a woman without realizing 
that you know more about her 
than she does. You will be a 
seeing man among blind multi- 
tudes, a hearing person in the 
world of the deaf. I don’t now 
how much fun romantic love is 
going to be to you after this.” 
Gloomily he said, “If I can 
free my home planet of Mizzer, 
it will be worth it. Whatever it 
is.” 

“You’re not going to turn into 
a woman!” she laughed, “Nothing 



that easy. But you are going to 
get wisdom. And I will tell you 
the whole story of the Sign of 
the Fish before you leave here.” 

“Not that, please,” he begged. 
“That’s a religion and the In- 
strumentality would never let 
me travel again.” 

“I’m going to have you scram- 
bled, Casher, so that nobody can 
read you for a year or two. And 
the Instrumentality is not going 
to send you back. 1 am. Through 
space-three.” 

“It’ll cost you a fine, big ship 
to do it.” 

“My master will approve when 
I tell him, Casher. Now give me 
that kiss you have been wanting 
to give me. Perhaps you will 
remember something of it when 
you come out of scramble.” 

She stood there. He did noth- 
ing. 

“Kiss me!” she commanded. 

He put his arm around her. 
She felt like a big little girl. She 
lifted her face. She thrust her 
lips up toward his. She stood on 
tip-toe. 

He kissed her the way a man 
might kiss a religious object. The 
heat and fierceness had gone out 
of his hopes. 

He had not kissed a girl, but 
power — tremendous power and 
wisdom put into a single slight 
form. 

“Is that the way your master 
kisses you?” 



ON THE STORM PLANET 



67 



She gave him a quick smile. 
“How clever of you! Yes, some- 
times. Come along now. We have 
to shoot some children before 
the technicians are ready. It will 
give you a good last chance of 
seeing what you can do when 
you have become what I am. 
Come along, the guns are in the 
hall.” 

XV 

Hphey went down an enormous 
light-oak staircase to a floor 
which Casher had never seen be- 
fore. It must have been the 
entertainment and hospitality 
center of Beauregard long ago, 
when the mister and owner Mur- 
ray Madigan was himself young. 

The robots did a good job of 
keeping away the dust and the 
mildew. Casher saw inconspic- 
uous little air-driers placed at 
strategic places, so that the rich 
tooled leather on the walls would 
not spoil, so that the velvet bar- 
stools would not become slimy 
with mold, so that the pool 
tables would not warp nor the 
golf clubs go out of shape with 
age and damp. By the Bell, he 
thought, that man Madigan 
could have entertained a thou- 
sand people at one time in a 
place this size. 

The gun-cabinet, now, that was 
functional. The glass shone. The 
velvet of oil showed on the 



steel and walnut of the guns. 
They were old earth models, 
very rare and very special. For 
actual fighting, people used the 
cheap artillery of the present 
time or wirepoints for close work. 
Only the richest and rarest of 
connoisseurs had the old earth 
weapons or could use them. 

T’ruth touched the guard- 
robot and waked him. 

The robot saluted, looked at 
her face and without further in- 
quiry, opened the cabinet. 

“Do you know guns?” said 
T’ruth to Casher. 

“Wirepoints,” he said. “Never 
touched a gun in my life.” 

“Do you mind using a learning- 
helmet, then? I could teach you 
hypnotically with the special 
rules of the Hechizera, but they 
might give you a headache or 
upset you emotionally. The hel- 
met is neuro-electric and it has 
filters.” 

Casher nodded and saw his 
reflection nodding in the polish- 
ed glass doors of the gun-cabinet. 
He was surprised to see how 
helpless and lugubrious he look- 
ed. 

But it was true. Never before 
in his life had he felt that a 
situation swept over him, wash- 
ed along like a great wave, left 
him with no choice and no re- 
sponsibility. Things were her 
choice now, not his, and yet he 
felt that her power was benign,

self-limited, restricted by factors 
at which he could no more than 
guess. He had come for one 
weapon — the cruiser which he 
had hoped to get from the Ad- 
ministrator Rankin Meiklejohn. 
She was offering him something 
else — psychological weapons in 
which he had neither experience 
nor confidence. 

Qhe watched him attentively for 
^ a long moment and then 
turned to the gun-watching ro- 
bot. 

“You’re little Harry Hadrian, 
aren’t you? The gun-watcher.” 

“Yes, ma’am,” said the silver 
robot brightly, “and I’m owl- 
brained too. That makes me very 
bright.” 

“Watch this,” she said, extend- 
ing her arms the width of the 
gun cabinet and then dropping 
them after a queer flutter of her 
hands. “Do you know what that 
means?” 

“Yes, ma’am,” said the little 
robot quickly, the emotion show- 
ing in his toneless voice by the 
speed with which he spoke, not 
by the intonation. “It means you 
have-taken-over and I-am-off- 
duty! Can-I-go-sit-in-the-garden 
and look-at-the-live-things?” 

“Not quite yet, little Harry 
Hadrian. There are some wind 
people out there now and they 
might hurt you. I have another 
errand for you first. Do you re- 



member where the teaching hel- 
mets are?” 

“Silver hats on the third floor 
in an open closet with a wire 
running to each hat? Yes.” 

“Bring one of those as fast as 
you can. Pull it loose very care- 
fully from its electrical connec- 
tion.” 

The little robot disappeared in 
a sudden, fast, gentle clatter up 
the stairs. 

T’ruth turned back to Casher. 
“I am helping you. You don’t 
have to look so gloomy about it.” 

“I’m not gloomy. The Admin- 
istrator sent me here on a crazy 
errand, killing an unknown und- 
erperson. I find out that the 
person is really a little girl. Then 
I find out that she is not an 
underperson, but a frightening 
old dead woman, still walking 
around alive. My life gets turn- 
ed upside down. All my plans 
are set aside. You propose to 
send me hope to fulfill my life’s 
work on Mizzer. I’ve struggled 
for this, so many years! Now 
you’re making it all come 
through, even though you are 
going to cook me through space- 
three to do it and throw in a lot 
of illegal religion and hypnotic 
tricks that I’m not sure I can 
handle. Now you tell me to 
come along — to shoot children 
with guns. I’ve never done any- 
thing like that in my life and 
yet I find myself obeying you. 



ON THE STORM PLANET 



69 



I’m tired out, girl, tired out. If 
you have put me in your power, 
I don’t even know it. I don’t even 
want to know it.” 

“Here you are, Casher, on the 
ruined wet world of Henriada. In 
less than a week you will be 
recovering among the military 
casualties of Colonel Wedder’s 
army. You will be under the 
clear sky of Mizzer, and the 
Seventh Nile will be near you, 
and you will be ready at long 
last to do what you have to do. 
You will have bits and pieces of 
memories of me. Not enough to 
make you find your way back 
here or to tell people all the 
secrets of Beauregard, but 
enough for you to remember that 
you have been loved. You may 
even — ” and she smiled very 
gently, with a tender wry humor 
on her face — “marry some Miz- 
zer girl because her body or her 
face or her manner reminds me 
to you.” 

“In a week?” he gasped. 
“Less than that.” 

e cried out, “Who are 
that you, an underperson, 
should run real people and mani- 
pulate their lives?” 

“I didn’t look for power, Cash- 
er. Power doesn’t usually work if 
you look for it. I have eighty- 
nine thousand years to live, 
Casher, and as long as my mast- 
er lives, I shall love him and 



take care of him. Isn’t he hand- 
some? Isn’t he wise? Isn’t he the 
most perfect master you ever 
saw?” 

Casher thought of the old 
ruined-looking body with the 
plastic knobs set into it; he 
thought of the faded pajama 
bottoms; he said nothing. 

“You don’t have to agree,” 
said T’ruth. “I know I have a 
special way of looking at him. 
But they took my turtle brain 
and raised the IQ to above nor- 
mal human level. They took me 
when I was a happy little girl, 
enchanted by the voice and the 
glance and the touch of my mast- 
er. They took me to where this 
real woman lay dying and they 
put me into a machine and they 
put her into one too. When they 
were through, they picked me 
up. I had on a pink dress with 
pastel blue socks and pink shoes. 
They carried me out into the 
corridor, on a rug. They had 
finished with me. They knew that 
I wouldn’t die. I was healthy. 
Can’t you see it, Casher. I cried 
myself to sleep, nine hundred 
years ago.” 

Casher could not really an- 
swer. He nodded sympathetical- 
ly- 

“I was a girl, Casher. Maybe 
I was a turtle once, but I don’t 
remember that, any more than 
you remember your mother’s 
womb or your laboratory bottle.

GALAXY 



In that one hour I was never 
to- be a girl again. I did not need 
go to school. I had her education, 
and it was a good one. She spoke 
twenty or more languages. She 
was a psychologist and a hyp- 
notist and a strategist. She was 
also the tyrannical mistress of 
this house. I cried because my 
childhood wag finished, because 
I knew what I would have to 
do. I cried because I knew that 
I could do it. I loved my master 
so, but I was no longer to be 
the pretty little servant who 
brought him his tablets or his 
sweetmeats or his beer. Now I 
saw the truth As she died I had 
myself become Henriada. The 
planet was mine, to cate for, to 
manage, to protect my master. 
If I come along and I protect and 
help you, is that so much for a 
woman who will just be grow- 
ing up when your grandchildren 
will all be dead of old age?” 

“No, no,” stammered Casher 
O’Neill. “But your own life? A 
family, perhaps?” 

A nger lashed across her pretty 
face. Her features were the 
features of the delicious girl- 
child T’ruth, but her expression 
was that of the citizeness Agatha 
Madigan, perhaps, a worldly 
woman reborn to the endless 
worldliness of her own wisdom. 

“Should I order a husband 
from the turtle bank, perhaps? 



Should I hire out a piece of my 
master’s estate, to be sold to 
somebody because I’m an under- 
person, or perhaps put to work 
somewhere in an industrial shop? 
I’m me. I may be animal, but I 
have more civilization in me than 
all the wind-people on this plan- 
et. Poor things! What kind of 
people are they, if they are only 
happy when they catch a big 
mutated duck and tear it to 
pieces, eating it raw? I’m not 
going to lose, Casher. I’m going 
to win. My master will live long- 
er than any person has ever 
lived before. He gave me that 
mission when he was strong and 
wise and well in the prime of 
his life. I’m going to do what I 
was made for, Casher, and you’re 
going to go back to Mizzer and 
make it free, whether you like 
it or not!” 

They both heard a happy 
scurrying on the staircase. 

The small silver robot, little 
Harry Hadrian, burst upon 
them; he carried a teaching hel- 
met. 

T’ruth said, “Resume your 
post. You are a good boy, little 
Harry, and you can have time 
to sit in the garden later on, 
when it is safe.” 

“Can I sit in a tree?” said the 
little robot. 

“Yes, if it is safe.” 

Little Harry Hadrian resumed 
his post by the gun cabinet. He 



ON THE STORM PLANET 



71 



kept the key in his hand. It was 
a very strange key, sharp at the 
end and as long as an awl. 
Casher supposed that it must be 
one of the straight magnetic 
keys, cued to its lock by a series 
of magnetized patterns. 

“Sit on the floor for a minute,” 
said T’ruth to Casher, “you’re 
too tall for me.” She slipped the 
helmet on his head, adjusted the 
levers on each side so that the 
helmet sat tight and true upon 
his skull. 

With a touching gesture of 
intimacy, for which she gave him 
a sympathetic apologetic little 
smile, she moistened the two 
small electrodes with her own 
spit, touching her finger to her 
tongue and then to the elec- 
trode. These went to his tem- 
ples. 

She adjusted the verniered 
dials on the helmet itself, lifted 
the rear wire and applied it to 
her forehead. 

Casher heard the click of a 
switch. 

“That did it,” he heard 
T’ruth’s voice saying, very far 
away. 

T_Je was too busy looking into 

^ the gun cabinet. He knew 
them all and loved some of 
them. He knew the feel of their 
stocks on his shoulder, the 
glimpse of their barrels in front 
of his eyes, the dance of the tar- 



get on their various sights, the 
welcome heavy weight of the gun 
on his supporting arm, the re- 
warding thrust of the stock 
against his shoulder when he fir- 
ed. He knew all this, and did not 
know how he knew it. 

“The Hechizera, Agatha her- 
self, was a very accomplished 
sportswoman,” murmured T’ruth 
to him. “I thought her knowl- 
edge would take a second print- 
ing when I passed it along to 
you. Let’s take these.” 

She gestured to little Harry 
Hadrian who unlocked the cabi- 
net and took out two enormous 
guns which looked like the long 
muskets mankind had on earth 
even before the age of space be- 
gan. 

“If you’re going to shoot chil- 
dren,” said Casher with his new- 
found expertness, “these won’t 
do. They’ll tear the bodies com- 
pletely to pieces.” 

T’ruth reached into the little 
bag which hung from her belt. 
She took out three shotgun 
shells. “I have three more,” she 
said. “Six children is all we 
need.” 

Casher looked at the slug pro- 
jecting slightly from the shot- 
gun casing. It did not look like 
any shell he had ever seen be- 
fore. The workmanship was un- 
believably fine and precise. 

“What are they? I never saw 
these before.” 



72 



GALAXY 



“Proximity stunners,” she said. 
“Shoot ten centimeters above the 
head of any living thing and the 
stunner knocks it out.” 

“You want the children alive?” 
“Alive, of course. And uncon- 
scious. They are a part of your 
final test.” 

XVI 

npwo hours later, after an ex- 
citing hike to the edge of the 
weather controls, they had the 
six children stretched out on the 
floor of the great hall. Four were 
little boys, two girls; they were 
fine-boned, soft-haired people, 
very thin, but they did not look 
too far from earth-normal. 

T’ruth called up a doctor-un- 
derman from among her ser- 
vants. There must have been a 
crowd of fifty or sixty undermen 
and robots standing around. Far 
up the staircase, John Joy Tree 
stood hidden, half in shadow. 
Casher suspected that he was as 
inquisitive as the others but 
afraid of himself, Casher, “the 
man of blood.” 

T’ruth said quietly but firmly 
to the doctor. “Can you give 
them a strong euphoric before 
you waken them? We don’t 
want to have to pluck them out 
of all the curtains in the house, 
if they go wild when they wake 
up.” 

“Nothing simpler,” said the 



doctor-underman. He seemed to 
be of dog origin but Casher 
could not tell. 

He took a glass tube and 
touched it to the nape of each 
little neck. The necks were all 
streaked with dirt. These chil- 
dren had never been washed in 
their lives, except by the lain. 

“Wake them,” said T’ruth. 

The doctor stepped back to a 
rolling table. It gleamed with 
equipment. He must have pre- 
set his devices, because all he 
did was to press a button and 
the children stirred into life. 

The first reaction was wildness. 
They got ready to bolt. The big- 
gest of the boys, who by earth- 
standards would have been about 
ten, got three steps before he 
stopped and began laughing. 

T’ruth spoke the Old Com- 
mon Tongue to them, very slow-, 
ly and with long spaces between 
the words: 

“Wind-children . do . you 
. know . where . you 
. are?” 

The biggest girl twittered back 
to her so fast that Casher could 
not understand it. 

T’ruth turned to Casher and 
said, “The girl said that she is 
in the Dead Place, where the 
air never moves and where the 
Old Dead Ones move around on 
their own business. She means 
us.” To the wind-children she 
spoke again. 



ON THE STORM PLANET 



73 



“What . would . you . 
like . most?” 

The biggest girl went from 
child to child. They nodded 
agreement vigorously . They 
formed a circle and began a little 
chant. By the second repetition 
around, Casher could make it 
out. 

Shig — shag — shuggery 
shuck shuck shuck ! 

What all of us need is 
an all-around duck. 

Shig — shag — shuggery, 
shuck shuck shuck! 

At the fourth of fifth repeti- 
tion they all stopped and looked 
at T’ruth who was so plainly the 
mistress of the house. 

She in turn spoke to Casher 
O’Neill: “They think that they 
want a tribal feast of raw duck. 
What they are going to get is 
inoculations against the worst 
diseases of this planet, several 
duck meals, and their freedom 
again. But they need something 
else beyond all measure. You 
know what that is, Casher, if 
you can only find it.” 

The whole crowd turned its 
eyes on Casher, the human eyes 
of the people and underpeople, 
the milky lenses of the robots. 

Casher stood aghast. 

“Is this a test?” he said 

“You could call it that,” said 
T’ruth, looking away from him. 



/'dasher thought furiously and 
rapidly. It wouldn’t do any 
good to make them into for- 
getties. The household had 
enough of them. T’ruth had an- 
nounced a plan to let them loose 
again. Mister and owner Murray 
Madigan must have told her, 
sometime or other, to “do some- 
thing” about the wind people. 
She was trying to do it. The 
whole crowd watched him. What 
might T’ruth expect? 

The answer came to him in 
a flash. 

If she were asking him, it 
must be something to do with 
himself. Something which he — 
uniquely among these people, 
underpeople and robots — had 
brought to the storm-sieged man- 
sion of Beauregard. 

Suddenly he saw it. 

“Use me, my lady Ruth,” said 
he, deliberately giving her the 
wrong title, “to print on them 
nothing from my intellectual 
knowledge, but everything from 
my emotional makeup. It would 
not do them any good to know 
about Mizzer, where the Twelve 
Niles work their way down 
across the Intervening Sands. 
Nor about Pontoppidan, the 
Gem Planet. Nor about Olympia, 
where the blind brokers prome- 
nade under numbered clouds. 
Knowing things would not help 
these children. But wanting — ” 

Wanting things was different. 



74 



GALAXY 



He was unique. He had want- 
ed to return to Mizzer. He had 
wanted return beyond all dreams 
of blood and revenge. He had 
wanted things fiercely, wildly, 
so that even if he could not get 
them, he zig-zagged the galaxy 
in search of them. 

T’ruth was speaking to him 
again, urgently and softly, but 
not in so low a voice that the 
others in the room could not 
hear. 

“And what, Casher O’Neill, 
should I give them from you?” 
she asked softly. 

“My emotional structure. My 
determination My desire. Noth- 
ing else. Give them that and 
throw them back into the winds. 
Perhaps if they want something 
fiercely enough, they will grow 
up to find out what it is.” 
There was a soft murmur of 
approval around the room. 

T’ruth hesitated a moment and 
then nodded. “Casher, you an- 
swered quickly and perceptively. 
Bring seven helmets, Eunice, 
Stay here, doctor.” 

Eunice, the forgetty, left, tak- 
ing two robots with her. 

“A chair,” said T’ruth to no 
one in particular. “For him.” 

A large powerful underman 
pushed his way through the 
crowd and dragged a chair to 
the end of the room. 

T’ruth gestured that Casher 
should sit in it. 



Qhe stood in front of him. 
^ Strange, thought Casher, that 
she should be a great lady and 
still a little girl. How could he 
ever find a girl like her? He 
was not even afraid of the mys- 
tery of the Fish, or the image 
of the man on two pieces of 
wood. He no longer dreaded 
space-three, where so many trav- 
ellers had gone in and so few 
had come out. He felt safe, com- 
forted by her wisdom and au- 
thority. He felt that he would 
never see the like of this again 
— a child running a planet and 
doing it well, a half-dead man 
surviving through the endless de- 
votion of his maidservant, a 
fierce woman hypnotist living on 
with all the anxieties and an- 
gers of humanity gone but with 
the skill and obstinacy of turtle 
genes to sustain her in her re- 
imprinted form. 

“I can guess what you are 
thinking,” said T’ruth, “but we 
have already said the things that 
we had to say. I’ve peeped into 
your mind a dozen times and I 
know that you want to go back 
to Mizzer so bad that space- 
three will spit you out right at 
the ruined fort where the big 
turn of the Seventh Nile begins. 
In my own way I love you, Cash- 
er, but I could not keep you here 
without turning you into a for- 
getty and making you a servant 
to my master. You know what 



ON THE STORM PLANET 



75 



always comes first with me, and 
always will.” 

“Madigan.” 

“Madigan,” she answered, and 
with her voice the name itself 
was a prayer. 

Eunice came back with the 
helmets. 

“When we are through with 
these, Casher, I’ll have them 
take you to the conditioning 
room. Good-by, my might have 
been.” 

In front of everyone, she kiss- 
ed him full on the lips. 

He sat in the chair, full of 
patience and contentment. Even 
as his vision blacked out, he 
could see the thin light sheath 
of a smock on the girlish figure, 
he could remember the tender 
laughter lurking in her smile. 

In the last instant of his con- 
sciousness, he saw that another 
figure had joined the crowd — 
the tall old man with the worn 
bathrobe, the faded blue eyes, 
the thin yellow hair. Murray 
Madigan had risen from his pri- 
vate-life-in-death and had come 
to see the last of Casher O’Neill. 
He did not look weak, nor fool- 
ish. He looked like a great man, 
wise and strange in ways beyond 
Casher’s understanding. 

There was the touch of T’ruth’s 
little hand on his arm and ev- 
erything became a velvety clut- 
tered dark quiet inside his own 
mind. 



XT Then he awoke, he lay naked 
* ' and sunburned under the 
hot sky of Mizzer. Two soldiers 
with medical patches were roll- 
ing him on to a canvas litter. 

“Mizzer!” he cried to himself. 
His throat was too dry to make 
a sound. “I’m home.” 

Suddenly the memories came 
to him and he scrabbled and 
snatched at them, seeing them 
dissolve within his mind before 
he could get paper to write them 
down. 

Memory: there was the front 
hall, himself getting ready to 
sleep in the chair, with the old 
giant of a Murray Madigan at 
the edge of the crowd and the 
tender light touch of T’ruth — 
his girl, his girl, now uncountable 
light-years away — putting her 
hand on his arm. 

Memory: there was another 
room, with stained glass pictures 
and incense, and the weepworthy 
scenes of a great life shown in 
frescoes around the wall. There 
were the two pieces of wood and 
man in pain nailed to them. But 
Casher knew that scattered and 
coded through his mind, there 
was the ultimate and undefeat- 
able wisdom of the sign of the 
Fish. He knew he could never 
fear fear again. 

Memory: there was a gaming 
table in a bright room, with the 
wealth of a thousand worlds be- 
ing raked toward him. He was a 



76 



GALAXY 



woman, strong, wig-busted, be- 
jewelled and proua. He was 
Agatha Madigan, winning at the 
games. (That must have come, 
he thought, when they printed 
me with T’ruth.) And in that 
mind of the Hechizera, which 
was now his own mind too, there 
was clear sure knowledge of how 
he could win men and women, 
officers and soldiers, even un- 
derpeople and robots, to his 
cause without a drop of blood 
or a word of anger. 

The man, lifting him on the 
litter, made red waves of heat 
and pain roll over him. 

He heard one of them say, 
“Bad case of burn. Wonder how 
he lost his clothes?” 

The words were matter-of- 
fact; the comment was nothing 
special; but the cadence, that 
special cadence, was the true 
speech of Mizzer. 

As they carried him away he 
remembered the face of Rankin 
Meiklejohn, enormous eyes star- 
ing with inward despair over the 
brim of a big glass. That was 
the Administrator, on Henriada. 
That was the man who sent him 
past Ambiloxi to Beauregard at 
two seventy-five in the morning. 
The litter jolted a little. 

He thought of the wet marshes 
of Henriada and knew that soon 
he would never remember them 
again. The worms of the torna- 
does creeping up to the edge of 



the estate. The mad wise face 
of John Joy Tree. 

Space-three? Space-three? Al- 
ready, even now, he could not 
remember how they had put him 
into space-three. 

And space-three itself — 

All the nightmares which man- 
kind has ever had pushed into 
Casher’s mind. He twisted once 
in agony, just as the litter 
reached a medical military cart. 
He saw a girl’s face — what was 
her name? — and then he slept. 

XVII 

TT'ourteen Mizzer days later, the 
-*• first test came. 

A doctor colonel and an in- 
telligence colonel, both in the 
workaday uniform of Colonel 
Wedder’s Special Forces, stood 
by his bed. 

“Your name is Casher O’Neill 
and we do not know how your 
body fell among the skirmish- 
ers,” the doctor was saying, 
roughly and emphatically. Cash- 
er O’Neill turned his head on the 
pillow and looked at the man. 

“Say something more!” he 
whispered to the doctor. 

The doctor said, “You are a 
political intruder and we do not 
know how you got mixed up 
among our troops. We do not 
even know how you got back 
loose among the people of this 
planet.” 



ON THE STORM PLANET 



77 



The intelligence colonel stand- 
ing beside him, nodded agree- 
ment. 

“Do you think the same thing, 
Colonel?” whispered Casher 
O’Neill to the intelligence colo- 
nel. 

“I ask questions. I don’t an- 
swer them,” said the man gruff- 
ly- 

Casher felt himself reaching for 
their minds with a kind of finger- 
tip which he did not know he 
had. It was hard to put into 
ordinary words, but it felt as 
though someone had said to him, 
“That one is vulnerable at the 
left forefront area of his con- 
sciousness, but the other one is 
well armored and must be reach- 
ed through the midbrain.” Cash- 
er was not afraid of revealing 
anything by his expression. He 
was too badly burned and in 
too much pain to show nuances 
of meaning on his face. (Some- 
where he had heard of the wild 
story of the Hechizera of Gon- 
falon! Somewhere endless storms 
boiled across ruined marshes 
under a cloudy yellow sky! But 
where, when, what was that . .? 
He could not take time off for 
memory. He had to fight for his 
life.) 

“Peace be with you,” he whis- 
pered to both of them. 

“Peace be with you,” they re- 
sponded in unison, with some 
surprise. 



“Lean over me, please,” said 
Casher, “so that I do not have 
to shout.” 

They stood stock straight. 

Somewhere in the resources of 
his own memory and intelligence 
Casher found the right note of 
pleading which could ride his 
voice like a carrier wave and 
make them do as he wished. 

“This is Mizzer,” he whisper- 
ed. 

“Of course this is Mizzer,” 
snapped the intelligence colonel, 
“and you are Casher O’Neill. 
What are you doing here?” 

“Lean over, gentlemen,” he 
said softly, lowering his voice so 
that they could barely hear him. 

This time they did lean over. 

His burned hands reached for 
their hands. The officers noticed 
it, but since he was sick and un- 
armed, they let him touch them. 

Suddenly he felt their minds 
glowing in his as brightly as if 
he had swallowed their gleaming, 
thinking brains at a single gulp. 

He spoke no longer. 

He thought at them — torren- 
tial, irresistible thought. 

I am not Casher O’Neill. You 
will find his body in a room, 
tour doors down. I am the civil- 
ian Bindaoud. 

'Hphe two colonels stared,

Casher went on: “Our finger-

prints and records have gotten 
mixed. Give me the fingerprints 
and papers of the dead Casher 
O’Neill. Bury him then, quietly, 
but with honor. Once he loved 
your leader and there is no point 
in stirring up wild rumors about 
returns from out of space. I am 
Bindaoud. You will find my re- 
cords in your front office. I am 
not a soldier. I am a civilian 
technician doing studies on the 
salt in blood chemistry under 
field conditions. You have heard 
me, gentlemen. You hear me 
now. You will hear me always. 
But you will not remember this, 
gentlemen, when you awaken. I 
am sick. You can give me water 
and a sedative.” 

They still stood, enraptured 
by the touch of his hands. 



Casher O’Neill said, “Awaken.” 
Casher O’Neill let go their 
hands. 

The medical colonel blinked 
and said amiably, “You’ll be bet- 
ter, mister and doctor Bindaoud. 
I’ll have the orderly bring you 
water and a sedative.” 

To the other officer he said, “I 
have an interesting corpse four 
doors down. I think you had 
better see it.” 

They left, talking. 

Casher O’Neill tried to think 
of the recent past, but the blue 
light of Mizzer was all around 
him, the sand-smell, the sound 
of horses galloping. For a mo- 
ment he thought of a big child’s 
blue dress and he did not know 
why he almost wept.

business — or in spite of itl 



Date: April 29, 2017. 

F rom : President. 

To : Vice Presidents, Regional 

Managers. 

Subject: Loose handling of in- 
formation. 

The Chairman of the Board 
has asked me to call to your at- 
tention a disturbing laxity in 
the handling of proprietary 
Company information. There 
has been too much casual dis- 
cussion of Company plans, ex- 
penditures, technical processes 
and formulas. The Chariman 
and the rest of the Board were 
quite disturbed that a competi- 
tive distiller was able to learn 
in advance of publication details 
of our newest advertising cam- 



paign based on the virtues of our 
splendid new hardwood whiskey 
bottles. This leak of informa- 
tion will force us to spend addi- 
tional millions of dollars edu- 
cating the public to the fact that 
only our particular wooden con- 
tainer, with its special wood and 
unique interior design, confers 
the benefits described. 

We of course want to maintain 
and promote interdepartmental 
co-operation and smooth working 
relationships, but it is considered 
desirable that there be less frat- 
ernization between personnel of 
different departments. Naturally 
this will have to be approached 
with tact and sublety. 

In particular, Technical per- 



80 



sonnel must stop casually reveal- 
ing details of secret processes and 
materials to Sales personnel. Ac- 
counting and Sales must stop 
discussing selling prices, mark- 
ups, salaries, commissions, etc,, 
with Production and with Re- 
search. And Purchasing must 
stop revealing potential or ac- 
tual fluctuations in raw mater- 
ial markets, to Sales and Produc- 
tion. This constant hubbub of 
gossip creates anxieties and dis- 
satisfactions and is definitely in- 
imical to the best interests of In- 
terstellar Distilleries, Inc. 

The Chairman and I want you 
to give this your personal atten- 
tion and to enlist tactfully the 
co-operation of your department 
heads and managers. 

Cordially,

Subject: Request for Develop-

NP D No. V-2016-37. 

I have your memorandum in- 
quiring as to progress on subject 
project. 

It has been less than thirteen 
months since you entered this re- 
quest. Considerable laboratory 
time has been expended on this 
project, and a number of prom- 
ising leads developed. However, 
press of other work (you your- 
self have several other requests 
in) coupled with personnel 
shortages and a limited budget, 
have delayed the project. Would 
you like us to assign it an “A” 
priority, or perhaps a “B”? 

This project deals with a pro- 
cess for hollowing out wooden 
blocks, leaving a rather complex 
inner surface. It is regrettable 
that you find it necessary to be 
so uninformative as to the pro- 
cess you are currently using. 
(We presume that this is some- 
thing you already have in pro- 
duction.) It would help immea- 
surably if you could at least in- 
form us as to the finished prod- 
uct involved. We can only con- 
jecture from the incomplete spe- 
cifications you supplied that it 
is some kind of a food contain- 
er. If so, you should so advise 
us so that we may start getting 

GALAXY 



clearance from the Federal and 
Interstellar Food and Drug Ad- 
ministrations. We are sure you 
are well acquainted with this 
Company’s liabilities in regard 
to edible products. 

We find that we have used up 
all the sample blocks of wood 
you sent us. Since you specify 
that no other wood is satisfac- 
tory, could you send us another 
supply?

E. J. : I’m rather proud of 
some savings we’ve been able to 
effect lately, and I’m sure you’ll 
appreciate having one particu- 
larly substantial item called to 
your attention. 

Some of our divisions have 
been using considerable numbers 
of lead pencils. Working with 
our suppliers, I was able to find 
a new experimental pencil, just 
coming into production, which 
is nearly nine per cent cheaper 
in wholesale lots. Instead of be- 
ing made from prime solid ce- 
dar, this new pencil has a com- 
position moulded around the 
lead, made from ground waste 
wood with a synthetic glue bind- 
er. As I understand it, the sav- 
ing results from the use of the 
the substitution of moulding for 
the old cutting and shaping pro- 
cesses. 

We are always alert for oppor- 
tunities to reduce costs and thus 



augment our profits, f think we 
can be forgiven a little pride 
when we are as successful as we 
have been in this case.

Vice President.

From: Ex-Production Manager, 
Arcturus V. 

To : President. 

Subject: Pencilburgers. 

Enclosed is my resignation, 
which I am completing while I’m 
still able to write. 

First of all, let me inform you 
that your shipment of 250,000 
wooden bottles will not arrive 
on schedule. They are all ready 
to go, but I think when you hear 
about them you won’t want to 
waste shipping costs. We may as 
well leave them here. 

Secondly, I’ll explain about 
the pencilburgers. It’s very sim- 
ple. The only way to make the 
damned bottles is the way the 
original samples were made. (If 
I’d known how those were made, 
I’d never have come out here.) 
The dominant race on Arctur- 
us V is a race of intelligent ter- 
mites, about two inches long. 
That is, the individuals are two 
inches long. They produce and 
trade around the galaxy all sorts 
of carved wooden goods. They’re 
very artistic, and good scientists 
too in their way. The wooden 
bottles they make have just the 



84 



GALAXY 



right chemistry, and some 
damned thing in the pattern of 
their inner surfaces, to give 
whiskey the mellowness and spe- 
cial boost we advertise. 

As you may or may not know, 
we’ve been trying for a year to 
get Research off its fanny to de- 
velop some mechanical way of 
hollowing out the bottles, but 
they haven’t come up with any- 
thing, so when the deadline got 
close I went ahead and contract- 
ed with the termites to have 
them do the work. We take a 
block of wood and shape it on 
the outside, then they eat their 
way in through the neck and 
shape it on the inside the way 
its supposed to be. 

About four months ago I dis- 
covered that there’s something 
about an ordinary lead pencil 
from Earth that makes it a great 
delicacy here. We grind up a 
pencil, lead and all, except for 
the little brass part and the rub- 
ber eraser. Some of the termites 
like it without any rubber. Oth- 
ers like it with the rubber sliced 
or ground up and sprinkled on, 
like onion in a hamburger. We 
serve a pencilburger between 
two small slabs of ordinary local 
wood instead of a bun. 

They don’t give a damn about 
Terran money if they can get 
pencilburgers instead. 

Now, I was very thorough in 
my requisitions and specified the 



exact kind of pencils I needed 
and all, but some jackass went 
ahead and shipped some new 
kind that seems to be made out 
of sawdust instead of good aro- 
matic cedar. I was out in the 
hills supervising some lumber- 
ing when they came in, and no 
one found out what was happen- 
ing until over a hundred thou- 
sand pencilburgers had been 
doled out to the termites. 

I tell you, E. J., I wouldn’t 
believe it if I hadn’t seen it. 
There was something about 
those pencils that made the ter- 
mites absolutely ribald. The 
word is too mild. Think of the 
worst drunk you’ve ever been 
on, or seen, and multiply it by 
ten and imagine it went on for 
seven or eight days. 

The first day wasn’t so bad. 
They did carve all sorts of por- 
nographic pictures and mottos 
on all the wooden buildings, and 
put a lot of equipment out of 
commission. The second day they 
got into the files and ate up all 
the records. Ordinarily they 
don’t care much for paper, but 
they were too drunk to care. The 
third day they attacked person- 
nel. They weren’t vicious; just 
playful. One of their favorite 
tricks was to eat their way quiet- 
ly up through the seat of a wood- 
en chair someone was sitting on, 
and — 

But all that we could have 



A FLASK OF FINE ARCTURAN 



85 



stood. On the fourth day we dis- 
covered that they’d gotten into 
the insides of the bottles. 

I don’t know what the hell 
they did, but I can describe the 
results. If you take good whiskey 
and put it in one of those bot- 
tles, the following changes oc- 
cur within one day: 

1. The alcohol content drops 
to nil. 

2. The color changes to sick- 
ening green. 

3. The taste becomes awful. I 
can only describe it as tasting 
like vinegar in which spoiled salt 
herring have been soaked. 

There were other things that 
happened, but I haven’t time to 
describe them. Everything con- 
sidered, we’re all happy to come 
through it alive. 

I personally am in hiding 
from the Termite government, 
with a price on my head. I am 
also avoiding my former human 
employees, who seem to blame 
me for the whole thing. One 
bunch even went around look- 
ing for a rope, but fortunately 
the drunken termites had chew- 
ed them all up. 

I’m starting for the hills as 
soon as I mail this report. I’m 
taking two loaves of bread I 
managed to steal from the com- 
missary, and ten of the original 
sample bottles that are still filled 
with the good whiskey. I also 
have in my knapsack a few thou- 



sand of the old cedar pencils, 
with which I hope, after things 
have cooled down a little, to pro- 
pitiate the Termite authorities or 
a least bribe my way to the 
spaceport. I thought I might 
head out to the Lesser Magellan- 
ic Cloud, or somewhere. 

You can apply my last month’s 
salary against the whiskey. 

Good-by and good luck, 
Otto Stehdenbed.

SV WILLY LEY 

FORERUNNERS 
OF THE 

PLANETARIUM 

( C r Tphe forerunner of the plan- 
etarium of today is the 
orrery, and the forerunner of the 
orrery . 

When I said this sentence 
aloud at home, both my daugh- 
ters interrupted me in unison — 
a unison that would normally 
need half a dozen rehearsals to 
make it as perfect as it was. But 



87 



they did not say the same thing. 
One of them said: “The what?” 
while the other, not trusting my 
pronunciation, said: “Spell it.” I 
did spell it. But that did not 
clarify the situation at all; they 
swore they had never heard the 
word. 

I pointed out that both of 
them had repeatedly seen a very 
fine orrery. The answer again 
came in unison: “Where?” 

I’ll explain what an orrery is 
in a moment, but it seems to 
me that the word should be ex- 
plained first. If somebody had 
asked me, say about a year ago, 
about the derivation of the word 
I probably would have guessed 
that it was somehow derived 
from the Latin hora, meaning 
“hour” — assuming that some- 
body in England, a century or 
two ago, had dropped the initial 
“h” somewhere along the way. 

My guess would have been 
ingenious and totally wrong. It 
so happens that the word orrery 
is not a corruption of a Latin 
term; it is a name. The device 
is named after Charles Boyle, 
Fourth Earl of Orrery. And the 
earl was not even the inventor; 
he merely had a very fine one 
in his castle circa 1725. 

After getting the word out of 
the way I can proceed to the 
explanation of what an orrery 
really is. 

It is a model of the solar sys- 



tem and there is a very fine one 
at the Hayden Planetarium in 
New York City, where it is call- 
ed the Copemican Room. The 
planets, represented by spheres 
of the proper size, hang from the 
ceiling and move in circular 
tracks, accompanied by their 
moons which move around them. 
Of course the motion has been 
speeded up, or else one would 
not be able to see it. A similar 
large orrery is at the Morehead 
Planetarium, Chapel Hill, N.C., 
while a third one can be found 
in the German Museum in Mun- 
ich. 

I n all three cases a modern 
planetarium is housed in the 
same building, so that visitors 
can see easily how they differ in 
function. The orrery shows how 
the planets move in their orbits 
and the mechanism could, if de- 
sired, be stopped at the moment 
where the positions of the model 
planets agree with the positions 
of the actual planets on that 
day. That is how the solar sys- 
tem would appear at that mo- 
ment, as seen from the outside. 
The modern planetarium, on the 
other hand, produces the view 
from the earth. In fact, the star- 
ry sky of the planetarium is 
superior to the actual night sky 
in several respects. In the first 
place, it does not matter what 
the weather is doing outside the 



88 



GALAXY 



dome. In the second place, the 
motions can be speeded up so 
that you can actually follow the 
motions of Mars among the fixed 
stars. Finally, you are not re- 
stricted geographically to the 
place where you happen to be. 

Nor are you limited to the 
time in which you happen to 
live. The planetarium can repro- 
duce the sky as it looked from 
Ur of the Chaldees in 1950 B.C. 
when Alpha Draconis was the 
pole star; or it can reproduce the 
sky as seen from Manhattan 
Island in about 12,000 A.D. when 
Vega will be the North Star and 
the Southern Cross will be above 
the horizon over New York Bay. 

While the orreries in Munich, 
New York and Chapel Hill — 
listing them in chronological or- 
der of their completion — are 
large and expensive and there- 
fore rare devices, smaller or- 
reries exist in many places. The 
smallest and simplest device 
which could still be called an 
orrery is one that consists of an 
electric light bulb with a reflec- 
tor in the middle, a small globe 
of the earth and a small sphere 
representing the moon. When 
you turn a crank the moon will 
start spinning around the earth 
and the earth will start turning 
and describe its orbit around the 
sun. It is a teaching device for 
demonstrating the phases of the 
moon and for showing why the 



moon is not eclipsed by the 
earth’s shadow each time it goes 
around the earth. 

There can be no doubt that a 
large number of orreries which 
once existed have never been 
described in print. Those we 
know about all date from 1700 
or later and are, therefore, mod- 
els of the solar system after 
Copernicus and'Kepler had been 
generally accepted. Whether, say 
prior to 1500, anybody ever tried 
to build an orrery according to 
Ptolemy, with the earth in the 
center, is not known. It probably 
was not done because at the 
time the armillary sphere (we’ll 
get to that soon) was considered 
sufficient for the purpose of ex- 
plaining the construction of the 
universe. 

But we cannot be certain be- 
cause the written word is in- 
complete in a very peculiar way. 
Writers, especially at a time 
when there were very few of 
them, wrote selectively. They 
either wrote down what happen- 
ed to have made an impression, 
or else they wrote what they 
thought the future might wish to 
know. The result of this attitude 
is that we have very little knowl- 
edge of those things which these 
writers took for granted. If we 
now know what kinds of knives 
and forks were used at a baron- 
ial banquet in, say, 1600, we are 
likely to know this because of 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



89

the island of Hveen. (From his own work on 
his instruments.) 

actual knives and forks that have 
somehow come down to our time, 
not from contemporary descrip- 
tions. Let me add one more ex- 
ample. We would know from 
contemporary chronicles, bills of 
sale and similar things that the 
gold coin of the reign of Henry 
VII, minted around 1495, was 
called an “angel”. But it would 
be a major literary research pro- 
ject (and one that is likely to 
fail) to find out how an “angel’’ 
looked. Of course nobody needs 
to undertake this research pro- 



ject since we have the actual 
coin; it isn’t even a great rarity. 

The fact that a pre-Coperni- 
cian orrery is not mentioned any- 
where is therefore no proof that 
none ever existed. It merely 
proves that it, if it existed, did 
not become famous enough to 
be described. But let us assume 
that none was built. And that 
brings us to the question of 
what preceded the orrery. 

T T ere you get two opinions, de- 
pending on point of view. 
Those who consider an orrery 
mainly a complicated mechanical 
device are likely to name the 
astronomical clocks, which were 
the pride of many a European 
city between 1400 and 1600. As- 
tronomers, however, will be in- 
clined to name the armillary 
sphere as the forerunner, since 
it was an attempt at represent- 
ing the universe. 

And the armillary sphere, or 
armilla — both terms are used al- 
most interchangeably, though a 
more complicated example is 
usually called an armillary 
sphere — in turn goes back to 
the celestial globes of antiquity. 

Celestial globes were just what 
their name means, globes on 
which the positions of the major 
stars and constellations were 
engraved on the outside. An es- 
pecially fine example is a ce- 
lestial globe with a diameter of

GALAXY 




not quite 26 inches, supported by 
a statue of Atlas. The sculpture, 
of Greek origin, dates back to 
about 300 B.C. and is now in 
the National Museum at Naples. 
A number of other celestial 
globes, usually made of bronze 
or silver, has been mentioned by 
Muslim writers, especially if they 
were made for the ruling Caliph, 
but the oldest still extant ex- 
ample is one made in 1080 A.D. 
But as a device for teaching the 
solid sphere had a drawback. It 
showed the stars on the outside 
of a globe. The pupil had to 
imagine, if he could, that he saw 
the stars from the inside. 

The armillary sphere was a 
skeleton sphere; you could look 
through it. There is a mural dat- 
ing back to about 50 B.C. on the 
wall of a villa at Boscoreale, 
not far from Pompeii, which 
shows a sphere consisting only of 
the imaginary circles, like equa- 
tor, arctic and antarctic circles, 
and the ecliptic. It is not known, 
of course, whether this mural 
was just a painting or whether 
it can be taken as an illustration 
of this kind which actually ex- 
isted then. If it does depict some- 
thing then in actual existence, 
the model for the painting would 
be a very early armillary sphere. 
If it is a painting showing a 
principle, then it was the fore- 
runner of actual spheres to be 
built. 



The early pictures of armillary 
spheres which definitely are il- 
lustrations depicting existing 
spheres can be found in manu- 
scripts of the thirteenth and four- 
teenth centuries. They show the 
equator, the tropics the polar cir- 
cles, the ecliptic and usually a 
number of meridians. After that, 
as we know from actual exam- 
ples that have been preserved, 
the craftsmen took over and 
lavished their skill on the job 
of building a “good” sphere. The 
ecliptic was no longer a wire 
ring in the proper position. It 
became a band of chased copper 
with the signs of the zodiac en- 
graved upon it. There were mov- 
able pointers for the more im- 
portant stars. In some the plan- 
ets were added and could be 
• moved along wire loops by hand. 
But Venus was not just a ball of 
ivory, or Mars a ball of copper — 
they were symbolical figures re- 
presenting Venus and Mars. It is 
no exaggeration to say that some 
of these spheres were smothered 
in elaboration. 

I have often been asked by 
people who looked at one of 
these elaborate armillary spheres 
(or just photographs of them) 
how they were used for astro- 
nomical observations. The answ- 
er is that they weren’t They 
were teaching devices for class- 
room use The teacher might, for 
example, move the figure repre-

senting the sun into the constel- 
lation Virgo. He would then ex- 
plain that, with this position of 
the sun, the sign of Virgo and 
the neighboring constellations 
would be in the daylight sky 
and hence invisible, but that the 
constellations of the zodiac op- 
posite the position of the sun — 
“look through the sphere and 
you’ll see them” — would be in 
the night sky. 

I know of a modern astrono- 
mer who uses an armillary sphere 
for the purpose of teaching his 
students how astronomy was 
taught in the past. It not only 
does this particular job, it also 
proves that the armillary sphere 
itself was a rather good teaching 
device for memorizing and under- 
standing the apparent motions of 
the celestial bodies. 

Of course the armillary sphere 
was built with the assumption 
that the earth was in the center 
of the universe. The more elab- 
orate specimens do have a globe 
of the earth in the center. This 
enhances the sphere as a model 
of what the world was believed 
to be, but the central globe in- 
terfered with the teaching so 
that the spheres actually used 
had an empty center so that you 
could look through the sphere. 

W hile the armillary sphere 
' * was meant for students, the 
astronomical clocks were meant 



for the public. A typical arrange- 
ment (much simplified) is shown 
in Fig. 3. The upper clock was 
simply a clock, while the lower 
face showed the zodiac. There 
two arrangements were possible 
and both were used. Either you 
had the zodiac immobile, just 
painted on the background in 
gold, silver, green, blue, red and 
a few other colors and you had 
a golden disk representing the 
sun at the end of a pointer, mov- 
ing it over the signs of the zo- 
diac once a year. Or else (as 
assumed for Fig. 3) you had the 
golden disk of the sun immobile 
and the zodiac painted on a 
slowly moving circle. Separate 
dials gave the month and the 
date, while a slowly turning 
sphere which was half silver and 
half black showed the phases of 
the moon. 

A look at such a clock there- 
fore provided the date, the time 
of day, the prevailing lunar phase 
and the position of the sun 
along the zodiac. 

But this was only the actual 
information supplied by such a 
clock. There was still room for 
elaboration. The astronomical 
clock built in Strassbourg in 1352 
was an example. We know that 
the master who built this cathe- 
dral clock spent two full years 
on this work. (Legend says that 
his name was Jehan Boerhave 
and that he was the pupil of Arab 



92 



GALAXY 



craftsmen, but in fact, the name 
of the master is unknown.) A 
quick description will show why 
A rooster, perched on top, crow- 
ed every hour. Then a statue of 
the Virgin Mary appeared and 
the three Wise Men passed in 
front of her, bowing. The crow- 
ing of the rooster was followed 
by a hymn on a carillon. And 
there was a somewhat stylized 
human figure with a pointer 
moving over it, indicating that 
part of the body which was as- 
trologically favored for bleeding, 
if bleeding was deemed neces- 
sary. 

Yes, it was possible to be more 
elaborate than that, as was prov- 
ed in 1530 by Kaspar Brunner, 
when the City of Bern requested 
him to build an astronomical 
clock for a tower especially built 
for the purpose. The clock part 
consisted of the customary two 
dials, one giving the hours and 
minutes, the other the astrono- 
mical information for astrological 
purposes. Since Bern was in a 
republic, and since the clock was 
not a church clock but a city 
clock, Brunner could not use 
kings and princes as had been 
done elsewhere, nor could he use 
a religious theme for elaboration 
Hence the famous clock of Beni 
marked the hours as follows: 

Five minutes before the hour 
a rooster crowed and the figure 
of a fool sitting above him hit

two different bells. After that a 
royal figure, representing the 
sun, turned its hand holding an 
hourglass and a bear (the coat of 
arms of the city features a bear) 
who sat opposite the rooster 
shook his head. Thereupon, on 
a lower gallery, a whole troop 
of bears pranced across, some 
walking, some on horseback. Af- 
ter they were gone, the rooster 
crowed again, then a very tall 
figure of a man, dressed all in 
black, appeared, raised a hand 
holding a hammer and struck a

square bell. The new hour had 
started . 

Let’s get back to representa- 
tions of the sky. 

r | 'he earliest known example is 
-*• a tent made by an unknown 
Arab craftsman. It was conquer- 
ed during the Fifth Crusade; 
when Emperor Friedrich II of 
Hohenstaufen returned to Italy 
in 1229 he brought it with him. 
It is described as having had a 
cupola-shaped roof showing the 
constellations. A hidden clock- 
work made the stars move, as 
the not very detailed description 
says; in all probability it turned 
the whole cupola so that a man 
sitting inside the tent could watch 
the motion of the stars across the 
night sky in accelerated time. 

Unfortunately this earliest 
forerunner of the planetarium is 
lost without a trace. No good 
description is known. No draw- 
ing, if one was made, is still in 
existence. 

The next attempt to represent 
the appearance of the starry sky 
is much better documented. It is 
known as Gottorp’s Globus, nam- 
ed after Duke Friedrich von Hol- 
stein-Gottorp, who had it built 
for him. Scientific advisor was 
the mathematician and astrono- 
mer, Adam Olearius; the man 
who did the actual building was 
Andreas Busch. The work took 
from 1656 to 1664. 



It was a sphere of sheet cop- 
per, with a diameter of IIV 2 feet. 
On the outside it was painted to 
show the continents and oceans 
of the earth. But all the more 
important stars were represented 
by holes drilled through the cop- 
per so that Duke Friedrich, when 
he entered his globe during day- 
light hours, had a representation 
of the night sky. Since the ducal 
family had a Russian branch, 
the famous globe was taken to 
St. Petersburg in 1713; I have 
not been able "to find out what 
has happened to it since. 

The Gottorp globe found a 
successor in London in 1851 when 
James Wyld, M. P., had a sixty- 
foot globe built in the center of 
Leicester Square. Mr. Wyld’s 
original idea had been to show 
the extent of the British Empire 
to Londoners and visitors by 
means of a very large globe. But 
he then realized that a person 
standing near a very large globe 
can see only a small portion of 
that globe and he found a solu- 
tion in an inverted globe. 

The continents and oceans and 
rivers and so forth were put on 
the inside of his sixty-foot sphere 
in bas relief. That way a visitor 
could look at a much larger area 
at a glance and, if the reporter 
of the Illustrated London News 
of the time can be trusted, the 
globe was large enough so that 
a visitor would not realize that 



94 



GALAXY 



he looked at a concave surface. 
But James Wyld’s inverted globe 
— called the “georama” in some 
references — had nothing to do 
with astronomy or a representa- 
tion of the sky. 

I t seems a long way from Got- 
torp’s globe to the modern 
planetarium, but the long way 
was traversed in a single step, 
without any intermediary de- 
velopments. The way this came 
about was as follows: In 1903, 
Dr. Oskar von Miller, the son of 
Ferdinand von Miller, who was 
the director of the Royal Foun- 
dry in Munich, outlined his ideas 
for a museum which was to be 
devoted to accomplishments in 
science and technology. The mu- 
seum conceived by Dr. von Mill- 
er now exists: it is the German 
Museum in Munich. 

Part of the museum was to 
be devoted to astronomy, which 
meant a “planetarium”. When 
von Miller used this word he 
meant a large orrery. But in 
addition to a large orrery von 
Miller also wanted something 
that represented the sky as seen 
in a clear night. Knowing about 
Gottorp’s globe, he had some- 
thing like the movable cupola of 
an astronomical observatory in 
mind, with holes for the stars so 
that the night sky could be seen 
during the day by way of day- 
light shining through the holes. 



If operation during the night 
should be scheduled, floodlights 
could do the job. 

While Dr. von Miller had a 
general idea of how it could be 
done, he knew very well that 
he would need specialists for 
the details. He sent a request to 
the firm of Carl Zeiss in Jena, 
which did not only build optical 
instruments, but observatory cu- 
polas as well. At the Zeiss office 
they started to think. Wouldn’t 
it be better to use light bulbs of 
different strengths for the stars? 
That would make the operation 
of the new planetarium com- 
pletely independent of the 
weather. But what about the 
planets?

tury. (For detail see text.)

Dr. von Miller had not pre- 
scribed any figures but he want- 
ed his planetarium large enough 
to accomodate up to a hundred 
visitors at a time. This meant 
that the planets would have to 
be illuminated balls at the ends 
of pointers that would have to 
be as much as twenty or more 
feet in length. The designing 
engineers groaned at the thought. 
But the task, was, after all, only 
difficult. Nobody had asked for 
anything impossible and they 
had all the leeway they wanted 
when it came to detail. So they 
went to work. 

Before anything could be 
shown the first World War be- 
gan and everything was delayed 
for four years. But there had 
been enough preliminary work 
so that a first model was ready 
some eight months or so after 
the end of that war. Then it 
turned out that the first idea of 
how to do it had quite a number 
of drawbacks. 

The “planets” could not be 
made visible by means of spot- 
lights without illuminating part 
of the dome. And the big cupola 
which carried all the light bulbs 
representing the stars could not 
be turned, except so noisily that 
the lecturer’s voice would be 
drowned out. 

After this experience the di- 
rector of the Zeiss works, Dr. 
Walter Bauersfeld, came to the 



conclusion that the planets 
should be projected against the 
dome. But if you project the 
planets, why not the fixed stars 
as well? Therefore he proposed 
that the dome should not rotate 
but be solid and motionless, serv- 
ing only as the projection sur- 
face for the images originating 
from a series of small projectors 
located in the center of the 
sphere, that is to say in the cen- 
ter of the floor of the seating 
area. 

The suggestion was accepted, 
but it took five years until all 
the minor difficulties could be 
overcome. 

The first planetarium — as we 
now understand the term — was 
opened in Munich in the late 
summer of 1924. The Zeiss pro- 
jector did not yet have the now 
familiar shape resembling a mon- 
strous dumbbell. There was one 
projector for the fixed stars and 
an inclined cylinder for every- 
thing else. But it worked, and 
the firm of Carl Zeiss quickly 
received requests from other 
cities. The second Zeiss plane- 
tarium was built in Dusseldorf, 
the next one in Nuremberg and, 
after some delay, one in Berlin. 
In the meantime American mu- 
seums and scientific institutions 
had negotiated with Zeiss too, 
and the first planetarium in the 
United States was the Adler 
Planetarium in Chicago. It open- 



96 



GALAXY 



ed its doors on May 10, 1930. 
The Fels Planetarium in Phila- 
delphia was the second (Novem- 
ber 1, 1933), the Griffith Observ- 
atory and Planetarium in Los 
Angeles the third (May 14, 
1935). New York’s Hayden Plan- 
etarium followed hard on the 
heels of the Griffith Plane- 
tarium; it was opened on October 
2, 1935. The Buhl Planetarium 
in Pittsburgh was the fifth (Oc- 
tober 24, 1939) and the More- 
head Planetarium of the Uni- 
versity of North Carolina in 
Chapel Hill, N. C., rounded out 
the first half dozen when it was 
opened on May 10, 1949. 

How many are in operation 
in the United States now? 

According to a letter which 
Armand N. Spitz wrote to me 
on July 23, 1964, the number 
is “between 300 and 400” — and 
I might add that Armand N. 
Spitz is mainly responsible for 
this large number. 

nphe fully developed Zeiss pro- 
-*■ jector was a modem mir- 
acle, but modern miracles tend 
to be expensive. The Zeiss pro- 
jector was no exception. Spitz 
wanted a projector that would 
do what the Zeiss instrument 
could do, or at least come close, 
but that would be within finan- 
cial reach of High Schools, small- 
er museums and libraries in 
smaller communities. 



In 1947 he succeeded in build- 
ing a small and relatively inex- 
pensive functioning projector. 

The projector for the fixed 
stars consisted of a dodecahed- 
ron made of black plastic sheets. 
Inside the dodecahedron was a 
light bulb. The stars were holes 
of different sizes drilled into the 
black plastic through which the 
light of the bulb shone. To pro- 
duce the diurnal motion of the 
stars the machine was rotated 
around an axis parallel to the 
axis of the earth. Changes in 
latitude were produced by tilt- 
ing this axis. The planets and 
the sun and moon were handled 
by separate projectors. One of 
the first Spitz projectors was 
installed at the U.S. Merchant j 
Marine Academy at Kings 
Point, N.Y. Within ten years of 
its creation, nearly 200 of the 
small projectors were installed 
all over the United States. 

But while this was going on, j 
the Spitz projector grew, too. 
Model B, as it was called, was 
a much bigger projector, re- 
sembling in external shape the 
later model of the Zeiss projec- 
tor. But while the Zeiss projector i 
has a solid mounting, the Model 
B projector was suspended from 
cables, so that it seemed to float 
in air during a demonstration. 

The first of the Model B pro- 
jectors was installed at the Cen- 
tro Municipal de Divulgacion

Cientifica in Montevideo, Uru- 
guay. The second went to Flint 
College in Flint, Mich., and the 
third to the U.S. Air Force Acad- 
emy in Colorado Springs, Colo- 
rado. 

The advent of the space age 
added a new request. Up to 1957 
everybody had been quite happy 
to overcome time and geographi- 
cal location on the ground by 
means of a planetarium projec- 
tor. But then the question came 
up how things would look when 
seen from space. 

The first projection device 
which is not earthbound, though 
it rests on a solid mounting like 
the Zeiss instruments, is the one 
at Abrams Planetarium of Mich- 
igan State University in East 
Lansing, Michigan. It has the 
somewhat cumbersome name of 
Intermediate Space Transit Plan- 
etarium or ISTP. The Spitz 
ISTP can go into a satellite orbit 
around the earth, fly from the 



earth to the moon, make a loop 
around the moon and take up 
a parking orbit around the moon 
— or, at least it will look that 
way to the audience. 

The next type — still under 
development — is the Space 
Transit Simulator or STS, which 
will be able to do what the ISTP 
does, but in addition to that it 
will be capable of flying to Mars 
and to Venus. 

Astronauts getting ready for 
missions to Mars and to Venus 
will be able to use it for train- 
ing. And the day is not too far 
off when an astronaut, after hav- 
ing returned from an interplan- 
etary mission and being tired of 
answering questions of what 
things look like in space, wilt 
take his questioners by the hand, 
lead them to the nearest insti- 
tution which owns an STS and 
say;

THE SIXTH PALACE 

by ROBERT SILVERBERG 



St was the richest treasure in 
the galaxy, and anyone could win 
it. All you had to do was die l 



Ben Azai was deemed worthy and 
stood at the gate of the sixth palace 
and saw the ethereal splendor of the 
pure marble plates. He opened his 
mouth and said twice, "Waterl Waterl" 

In the twinkling of an eye they de- 
capitated him and threw eleven thous- 
and iron bars at him. This shall be a 
sign for all generations that no one 
shall err at the gate of the sixth 
palace. — Lesser Hekhaloth 

nphere was the treasure, and 
there was the guardian of 
the treasure. And there were the 
whitening bones of those who 
had tried in vain to make the 
treasure their own. Even the 
bones had taken on a kind of 
beauty, lying out there by the 
gate of the treasure vault, under 
the blazing arch of the heavens. 
The treasure itself lent beauty 
to everything near it — even the 
scattered bones, even the grim 
guardian. 

The home of the treasure was 



a small world that belonged to 
red Valzar. Hardly more than 
moon-sized, really, with no at- 
mosphere to speak of, a silent, 
dead little world that spun 
through darkness a billion miles 
from its cooling primary. A way- 
farer had stopped there once. 
Where from, where bound? No 
one knew. He had established a 
cache there, and there it still 
lay, changeless and eternal, trea- 
sure beyond belief, presided over 
by the faceless metal man who 
waited with metal patience for 
his master’s return. 

There were those who would 
have the treasure. They came, 
and were challenged by the 
guardian, and died. 

On another world of the Val- 
zar system, men undiscouraged 
by the fate of their predecessors 
dreamed of the hoard, and 



99 



schemed to possess it. Lipescu 
was one: a tower of a man, gold- 
en beard, fists like hammers, 
gullet of brass, back as broad 
as a tree of a thousand years. 
Bolzano was another: awl-shap- 
ed, bright of eye, fast of finger, 
twig-thick, razor-sharp. 

They had no wish to die. 

1 ipescu’s voice was like the 

■ ' rumble of island galaxies in 
collision. He wrapped himself 
around a tankard of good black 
ale and said, “I go tomorrow, 
Bolzano.” 

“Is the computer ready?” 

“Programmed with everything 
the beast could ask me,” the big 
man boomed. “There won’t be 
a slip.” 

“And if there is?” Bolzano 
asked, peering idly into the blue, 
oddly pale, strangely meek eyes 
of the giant. “And if the robot 
kills you?” 

“I’ve dealt with robots be- 
fore.” 

Bolzano laughed. “That plain 
is littered with bones, friend. 
Yours will join the rest. Great 
bulky bones, Lipescu. I can see 
them now.” 

“You’re a cheerful one, friend.” 

Lipescu shook his head heav- 
ily. “If you were realistic, you 
wouldn’t be in this with me,” 
he said slowly. “Only a dream- 
er would do such a thing as 
this.” One meaty paw hovered 



in the air, caugnt Bolzano’s fore- 
arm. The little man winced as 
bones ground together. Lipescu 
said, “You won’t back out? If I 
die, you’ll make the attempt?” 
“Of course I will, you idiot.” 
“Will you? You’re a coward, 
like all little men. You’ll watch 
me die, and then you’ll turn tail 
and head for another part of 
the universe as fast as you know 
how — won’t you?” 

“I intend to profit by your 
mistakes,” Bolzano said in a 
clear, testy voice. 1‘Let go of my 
arm.” 

Lipescu released his grip. The 
little man sank back in his chair, 
rubbing his arm. He gulped ale. 
He grinned at his partner and 
raised his glass. 

“To success,” Bolanzo said. 
“Yes. To the treasure.” 
“And to long life afterwards.” 
“For both of us,” the big man 
boomed. 

“Perhaps,” said Bolzano. “Per- 
haps.” 

TJ e had his doubts. The big 
man was sly, Ferd Bolzano 
knew. His was a good combina- 
tion, not often found; strength 
and cunning. Yet the risks were 
great. Bolzano wondered what 
he preferred — if Lipescu should 
gain the treasure on his attempt, 
he was assured of a share with- 
out risk, or if Lipescu should die, 
he would be forced to venture 



100 



GALAXY 



his own life. Which was better, 
a third of the treasure without 
hazard, or the whole thing for 
the highest stake? 

Bolzano was a good enough 
gambler to that. Yet there was 
more than cowardice to the man; 
in his own way, he longed for 
the chance to risk his life on the 
airless treasure world. 

Lipescu would go first. That 
was the agreement. Bolzano had 
stolen the computer, had turned 
it over to the big man, who 
would make the initial attempt. 
If he gained the prize, his was 
the greater share. If he perished, 
all was Bolzano’s. An odd part- 
nership, odd terms, but Lipescu 
would have it no other way, and 
Ferd Bolzano did not argue the 
point with his beefy compatriot. 
Lipescu would return with the 
treasure, or he would not return 
at all. There would be no middle 
way. Of this, both were certain. 

Bolzano spent an uneasy night. 
His apartment, in an airy shaft 
of a building overlooking glit- 
tering Lake Eris, was a com- 
fortable place, and he had little 
longing to leave it. Lipescu, by 
preference, lived in the stinking 
slums beyond the southern shore 
of the lake, and when the two 
men parted at midnight, they 
went in opposite ways. Bolzano 
considered bringing a woman 
home for the night — but did 
not. Instead, he sat moody and 



wakeful before the televector 
screen, peering at the green and 
'gold and ochre planets as they 
sailed through the emptiness. 

Toward dawn, he ran the tape 
of the treasure. Octave Merlin 
had made that tape, a hundred 
years before, as he orbited sixty 
miles above the surface of the 
airless little world. Now Merlin’s 
bones bleached on the plain, but 
the tape had come home, and 
bootlegged copies commanded a 
high price in hidden markets. 
His camera’s sharp eye had seen 
much. 

T here was the gate — there 
was the guardian. Gleaming, 
ageless, splendid. The robot stood 
ten feet high, a square, black 
shape topped by the tiny anthro- 
pomorphic head-dome, feature- 
less and sleek. Behind him the 
gate, wide open but impassable. 
And then the treasure, culled 
from the craftsmanship of a 
thousand worlds. Left here un- 
told years ago. 

No mere jewels, No dreary 
slabs of so-called precious metal. 
The wealth here was not intrin- 
sic; no vandal would think of 
melting the treasure into dead 
ingots. Here were statuettes of 
spun iron, that seemed to move 
and breathe. Plaques of purest 
lead, engraved with lathework 
that dazzled the mind and made 
the heart hesitate. Cunning in-

taglios in granite, from the work- 
shops of a frosty world half a 
parsec from nowhere. A scatter 
of opals, burning with an inner 
light, fashioned into artful loops 
of brightness. 

A helix of rainbow-colored 
wood. A series of interlocking 
strips of some beast’s bone, bent 
and splayed so that the pattern 
blurred and perhaps abutted 
some other dimensional contin- 
uum. Cleverly carved shells, one 
within the other, descending to 
infinity. Burnished leaves of 
nameless trees. Polished pebbles 
from unknown beaches. A dizzy- 
ing spew of wonders, covering 
some fifty square yards, sprawled 
out behind the gate in stunning 
profusion. 

Rough men unschooled in the 
tenets of esthetics had given 
their lives to possess the trea- 
sure. ft took no fancy knowledge 
to realize the wealth of it. Col- 
lectors, strung from galaxy to 
galaxy, would fight with bared 
fangs to claim their share. Gold 
bars did not a treasure make. 
But these things? Beyond dupli- 
cation, almost beyond price? 

Bolzano was wet with a fever 
of yearning before the tape had 
run its course. When it was 
over, he slumped in his chair, 
drained, depleted. 

Dawn came. The silvery moons 
fell from the sky. The red sun 
splashed across the heavens. 



Bolzano allowed himself the lux- 
ury of an hour’s sleep. 

And then it was time to begin. 

Asa precautionary measure, 
they left the ship in a park- 
ing orbit three miles above the 
airless world. Past reports were 
unreliable, and there was no 
telling how far the robot guard- 
ian’s power extended. If Lipescu 
was successful, Bolzano would 
descend for him — and the trea- 
sure. If Lipescu failed, Bolzano 
would land and make his own 
attempt. 

The big man looked even big- 
ger, encased in his suit and in 
the outer casement of a drop- 
shaft. Against his massive chest 
he wore the computer, an extra 
brain as lovingly crafted as any 
object in the treasure-hoard. The 
guardian would ask him ques- 
tions; the computer would help 
him answer. And Bolzano would 
listen. If Lipescu erred, possibly 
his partner could benefit by 
knowledge of the error and suc- 
ceed. 

“Can you hear me?” Lipescu 
asked. 

“Perfectly. Go on, get going!” 

“What’s the hurry? Eager to 
see me die?” 

“Are you that lacking in con- 
fidence?” Bolzano asked. “Do 
you want me to go first?” 

“Fool,” Lipescu muttered. 
“Listen carefully. If I die, I

don’t want it to be in vain.” 
“What would it matter to 
you?” 

The bulky figure wheeled 
round. Bolzano could not see 
his partner’s face, but he knew 
Lipescu must be scowling. The 
giant rumbled, “Is life that valu- 
able? Can’t I take a risk?” 
“For my benefit?” 

“For mine,” Lipescu said. “I’ll 
be coming back.” 

Lipescu walked to the lock. 
A moment later, he was through, 
and gliding downward, a one- 
man spaceship, jets flaring be- 
neath his feet. Bolzano settled 
by the scanner to watch. A tele- 
vector pickup homed in on Lipe- 
scu just as he made his landing, 
coming down in a blaze of fire. 
The treasure and its guardian 
lay a mile away. Lipescu rid 
himself of the dropshaft, step- 
ping from it like some newborn 
insect quitting a cocoon. He 
strode with giant bounds toward 
the waiting guardian. 

Bolzano watched. 

Bolzano listened. 

The televector pickup provid- 
ed full fidelity. It was useful for 
Bolanzo’s purposes, and useful, 
too, for Lipescu’s vanity — for 
the big man wanted his every 
moment taped for posterity. It 
was interesting to see Lipescu 
dwarfed by the guardian. The 
black faceless robot, squat and 
motionless, topped the big man 



by better than three feet. 

Lipescu said, “Step aside.” 

nphe robot’s reply came in sur- 
-®" prisingly human tones, 
though void of any distinguish- 
ing accent. “What I guard is not 
to be plundered.” 

“I claim it by right,” Lipescu 
said. 

“So have many others. But 
their right did not exist. Nor 
does yours. I cannot step aside 
for you.” 

“Test me,” Lipescu said. “See 
if I have the right or not!” 

“Only my master may pass.” 

“Who is your master? I am 
your master!” 

“My master is he who can 
command me. And no one can 
command me who shows ignor- 
ance before me.” 

“Test me, then,” Lipescu de- 
manded. 

“Death is the penalty for fail- 
ure.” 

“Test me.” 

“The treasure does not be- 
long to you.” 

“Test me and step aside.” 

“Your bones will join the rest 
here.” 

“Test me,” Lipescu said. 

Watching from aloft, Bolzano 
was tense. His thin body drew 
together like that of a chilled 
spider. Anything might happen 
now. The robot might propound 
riddles, like the Sphinx con- 



THE SIXTH PALACE 



103 



fronting Oedipus. It might de- 
mand the proofs of mathemati- 
cal theorems. It might ask the 
translation of strange words. So 
they gathered, from their knowl- 
edge of what had befallen other 
men here. And, so it seemed, to 
give a wrong answer was to earn 
instant death. 

He and Lipescu had ransack- 
ed the libraries of the world. 
They had packed all knowledge, 
so they hoped, into their com- 
puter. It had taken months, even 
with multistage programming. 
The tiny shining globe of metal 
on Lipescu’s chest contained an 
infinity of answers to an infinity 
of questions. 

Below, there was long silence 
as man and robot studied one 
another. Then the guardian said, 
“Define latitude.” 

“Do you mean geographical 
latitude?” Lipescu asked. 

Bolzano congealed with fear. 
The idiot, asking for a clarifi- 
cation! He would die before he 
began! 

The robot said, “Define lati- 
tude.” 

Lipescu’s voice was calm. “The 
angular distance of a point on 
a planet’s surface north or south 
of the equator, as measured from 
the center of the planet.” 

“Which is more consonant,” 
the robot asked. “The minor 
third or the major sixth?” 

There was a pause, Lipescu 



was no musician. But the com- 
puter would feed him the an- 
swer. 

a i. .• ,t 

ttnphe minor third,” Lipescu 
said. 

Without a pause, the robot 
fired another question. “Name 
the prime numbers between 5,237 
and 7,641.” 

Bolzano smiled as Lipescu 
handled the question with ease. 
So far, so good. The robot had 
asked strictly factual questions, 
schoolbook stuff, posing no real 
problems to Lipescu. After the 
initial hesitation and quibble 
over latitude, Lipescu had seem- 
ed to grow in confidence from 
moment to moment. Bolzano 
squinted at the scanner, looking 
beyond the robot, through the 
open gate, to the helter-skelter 
pile of treasures. He wondered 
which would fall to his lot when 
he and Lipescu divided them, 
two-thirds for Lipescu, the rest 
for him. 

“Name the seven tragic poets 
of Elifora,” the robot said. 

“Domiphar, Halionis, Slegg, 
Hork-Sekan — ” 

“The fourteen signs of the zo- 
diac as seen from Morneez,” the 
robot demanded. 

“The Teeth, the Serpents, the 
Leaves, the Waterfall, the 
Blot — ” 

“What is a pedicel?” 

“The stalk of an individual 



104 



GALAXY 



flower of an inflorenscence,” 
Lipescu answered. 

“How many years did the 
Siege of Larrinax last?” 

“Eight.” 

“What did the flower cry in 
the third canto of Somnor’s 
Vehicles?” 

“ ‘I ache, I sob, I whimper, I 
die,’ ” Lipescu boomed. 

“Distinguish between the sta- 
men and the pistil.” 

“The stamen is the pollen-pro- 
ducing organ of the flower; the 
pistil — ” 

And so it went. Question after 
question. The robot was not con- 
tent with the legendary three 
questions of mythology; it asked 
a dozen, and then asked more. 
Lipescu answered perfectly, 
prompted by the murmuring of 
the peerless compendium of 
knowledge strapped to his chest. 
Bolzano kept careful count: the 
big man had dealt magnificently 
with seventeen questions. When 
would the robot concede defeat? 
When would it end its grim quiz 
and step aside? 

It asked an eighteenth ques- 
tion, pathetically easy. All it 
wanted was an exposition of the 
Pythagorean Theorem. Lipescu 
did not even need the computer 
for that. He answered, briefly, 
concisely, correctly. Bolzano was 
proud of his burly partner. 

Then the robot struck Lipescu 
dead. 



I t happened in the flickering 
of an eyelid. Lipescu’s voice 
had ceased, and he stood there, 
ready for the next question. But 
the next question did not come. 
Rather, a panel in the robot’s 
vaulted belly slid open, and 
something bright and sinuous 
lashed out, uncoiling over the 
ten feet or so that separated 
guardian from challenger, and 
sliced Lipescu in half. The bright 
something slid back out of sight. 

Lipescu’s trunk toppled to one 
side. His massive legs remained 
absurdly planted for a moment; 
then they crumpled, a space- 
suited leg kicked once, and all 
was still. 

Stunned, Bolzano trembled in 
the lonelirtess of the cabin, and 
his lymph turned to water. What 
had gone wrong? Lipescu had 
given the proper answer to every 
question, and yet the robot had 
slain him. Why? Could the big 
man possibly have misphrased 
Pythagoras? No — Bolzano had 
listened. The answer had been 
flawless, as had the seventeen 
that preceded it. Seemingly the 
robot had lost patience with the 
game, then. The robot had cheat- 
ed. Arbitrarily, maliciously, it 
had lashed out at Lipescu, pun- 
ishing him for the correct an- 
swer. 

Did the robot cheat, Bolzano 
wondered? Could they act in 
malicious spite? No robot he 



THE SIXTH PALACE 



105 



knew was capable of such ac- 
tions. But this robot was unlike 
all others. 

For a long while, Bolzano re- 
mained huddled in the cabin. 
The temptation to blast free of 
orbit and head home was strong. 
Yet the treasure called t» him. 
Some suicidal impulse drove him 
on. Siren-like, the robot drew 
him downward. 

There had to be a way to 
make the robot yield, Bolzano 
thought, as he guided his small 
ship down to the broad barren 
plain. Using the computer had 
been a good idea, but it hadn’t 
helped Lipescu pass the robot. 
The records were' uncertain, but 
it appeared that in the past, 
men had died when they finally 
gave a wrong answer after a 
series of right ones. Lipescu had 
given no wrong answers. Yet he 
too had died. It was inconceiv- 
able that the robot understood 
some relationship of the squares 
on the hypotenuse and on the 
other two sides that was differ- 
ent from the relationship Lipe- 
scu had expressed. 

Bolzano wondered what meth- 
od would work. 

T T e plodded leadenly across 
•* -*• the plain toward the gate 
and its guardian. The germ of 
an idea formed in him, as he 
walked doggedly on. 

He was, he knew, condemned 



to death by his own greed. Only 
extreme agility of mind could 
save him from sharing Lipescu’s 
fate. Ordinary intelligence would 
not work. Odyssean cleverness 
was the only salvation. 

Bolzano approached the robot. 
Bones lay everywhere. Lipescu 
weltered in his own blood. 
Against that vast dead chest lay 
the computer, Bolzano knew. 
But he shrank from reaching for 
it. He would do without it. He 
looked away, unwilling to let 
the sight of Lipescu’s severed 
body interfere with the coolness 
of his thoughts. 

He collected his courage. The 
robot showed no interest in him. 

“Give ground,” Bolzano said. 
“I am here. I come for the trea- 
sure.” 

“Win your right to it.” 

“What must I do?” 
“Demonstrate truth,” the ro- 
bot said. “Reveal inwardness. 
Display understanding.” 

“I am ready,” said Bolzano. 
The robot offered a question. 
“What is the excretory unit of 
the vertebrate kidney called?” 
Bolzano contemplated. He had 
no idea. The computer could 
tell him, but the computer lay 
strapped to fallen Lipescu. No 
matter. The robot wanted truth, 
inwardness, understanding. 
Those things were not necessar- 
ily the same as information. Lip- 
escu had offered information. 



106 



GALAXY 



But Lipescu had perished. 

“The frog in the pond,” Bol- 
zano said, “utters an azure cry.” 

Mphere was silence. Bolzano 
watched the robot’s front, 
waiting for the panel to slide 
open and the sinuous something 
chop him in half. 

The robot said, “During the 
War of Dogs on Vanderveer IX, 
the embattled colonists drew up 
thirty-eight dogmas of defiance. 
Quote the third, the ninth, the 
twenty-second, and the thirty- 
fifth.” 

Bolzano pondered. This was 
an alien robot, product of an 
unknown hand. How did its 
maker’s mind work? Did it re- 
spect knowledge? Did it treasure 
facts for their own sake? Or did 
it recognize that information is 
meaningless, insight a non-logi- 
cal process? 

Lipescu had been logical. He 
lay in pieces. 

“The mereness of pain,” Bol- 
zano responded, “is ineffable and 
refreshing.” 

The robot said, “The monas- 
tery of Kwaisen was besieged by 
the soldiers of Oda Nobunaga on 
the third of April, 1582. What 
words of wisdom did the abbot 
utter?” 

Bolzano spoke quickly and 
buoyantly. “Eleven, forty-one, 
elephant, voluminous.” 

The last word slipped from his 



lips despite an effort to retrieve 
it. Elephants were voluminous, 
he thought. A fatal slip? The 
robot did not appear to notice. 

Sonorously, ponderously, the 
great machine delivered the next 
question. 

“What is the percentage of 
oxygen in the atmosphere of 
Muldonar VII?” 

“False witness bears a swift 
sword,” Bolzano replied. 

The robot made an odd hum- 
ming noise. Abruptly it rolled 
on massive treads, moving some 
six feet to its left. The gate of 
the treasure-trove stood wide, 
beckoning. 

“You may enter,” the robot 
said. 

Bolzano’s heart leaped. He 
had won! He had gained the 
high prize! 

Others had failed, their bones 
glistened on the plain. They had 
tried to answer the robot, some- 
times giving right answers, some- 
times giving wrong ones, and 
they had died. Bolzano lived. 

It was a miracle, he thought. 
Luck? Shrewdness? Some of 
each, he told himself. He had 
watched a man give eighteen 
right answers and die. So the 
accuracy of the responses did 
not matter to the robot. What 
did? Inwardness. Understanding. 
Truth. 

There could be inwardness and 
understanding and truth in ran- 



THE SIXTH PALACE 



107 



dom answers, Bolzano realized. 
Where earnest striving had fail- 
ed, mockery had succeeded. He 
had staked his life on nonsense, 
and the prize was his. 

JLT e staggered forward, into 
the treasure-trove. Even in 
the light gravity, his feet were 
like leaden weights. Tension eb- 
bed in him. He knelt among the 
treasures. 

The tapes, the sharp-eyed te- 
levector scanners, had not be- 
gun to indicate the splendor of 
what lay here. Bolzano stared in 
awe and rapture at a tiny disk, 
no greater in diameter than a 
man’s eye, on which myriad coil- 
ing lines writhed and twisted in 
patterns of rare beauty. He 
caught his breath, sobbing with 
the pain of perception as a 
gleaming marble spire, angled in 
mysterious swerves, came into 
view. Here, a bright beetle of 
some fragile waxy substance 
rested on a pedestal of yellow 
jade. There, a tangle of metallic 
cloth spurted dizzying patterns 
of luminescence. And over there 
— and beyond — and there — 

The ransom of a universe, Bol- 
zano thought. 

It would take many trips to 
carry all this to his ship. Per- 
haps it would be better to bring 
the ship to the hoard, eh? He 
wondered, though, if he would 
lose his advantage if he stepped 



back through the gate. Was it 
possible that he would have to 
win entrance all over again? And 
would the robot accept his an- 
swers as willingly the second 
time? 

It was something he would 
have to chance, Bolzano decid- 
ed. His nimble mind worked out 
a plan. He would select a dozen, 
two dozen of the finest trea- 
sures, as much as he could com- 
fortably carry, and take them 
back to the ship. Then he would 
lift the ship and set it down next 
to the gate. If the robot raised 
objections about his entering, 
Bolzano would simply depart, 
taking what he had already se- 
cured. There was no point in 
running undue risks. When he 
had sold this cargo, and felt 
pinched for money, he could 
always return and try to win ad- 
mission once again. Certainly, no 
one else would steal the horde 
if he abandoned it. 

Selection, that was the key. 



grouching, Bolzano picked 
' 1 through the treasure, choos- 
ing for portability and easy mar- 
ketability. The marble spire? Too 
big. But the coiling disk, yes, 
certainly, and the beetle, of 
course, and this small statuette 
of dull hue, and the cameos 
showing scenes no human eye 
had ever beheld, and this, and 
this, and this — 



108 



GALAXY 



His pulse raced. His heart 
thundered. He saw himself trav- 
elling from world to world, vend- 
ing his wares. Collectors, mu- 
seums, governments would vie 
with one another to have these 
prizes. He would let them bid 
each object up into the millions 
before he sold. And, of course, 
he would keep one or two for 
himself, or perhaps three or 
four, souvenirs of this great ad- 
venture. 

And someday when wealth 
bored him he would return, and 
face the challenge again. And 
he would dare the robot to 
question him, and he would re- 
ply with random absurdities, de- 
monstrating his grasp on the 
fundamental insight that in 
knowledge there is only hollow 
merit. And the robot would ad- 
mit him once more to the trea- 
sure-trove. 

Bolzano rose. He cradled his 
lovelies in his arms. Carefully, 
carefully, he thought. Turning, 



he made his way through the 
gate. 

The robot had not moved. It 
had shown no interest as Bol- 
zano plundered the hoard. The 
small man walked calmly past 
it. 

The robot said, “Why have 
you taken those? What do you 
want with them?” 

Bolzano smiled. Nonchalantly 
he replied, “I’ve taken them be- 
cause they’re beautiful. Because 
I want them. Is there a better 
reason?” 

“No,” the robot said, and the 
panel slid open in its ponderous 
black chest. 

Too late, Bolzano realized that 
the test had not yet ended, that 
the robot’s question had arisen 
out of no idle curiosity. And this 
time he had replied in earnest, 
speaking in rational terms. 

Bolzano shrieked. He saw the 
brightness coming toward him. 

Death followed instantly.

They lived forever — and, of 
course, they feared to die! 



S he interrupted the suave voice 
coldly. “I don’t even listen 
to threats,” she said, and snap- 
ped off sound and vision. With- 
in five seconds the buzzer was 
rasping its hoarse demand for 



attention. She didn’t move, 
frowning at the blank screen of 
the visiphone. Presently the 
buzzer stopped. 

When it sounded again five 
minutes later she switched on. 
The face that appeared was 
again the pale, blank face of the 



no 



extortionist. Obviously he wore 
a mask. Without giving him a 
chance to speak she switched off 
again. 

This time the buzzer stood si- 
lent. 

She was a tall, regal woman, 
with something icy and enig- 
matic about her perfection. For 
fully ten minutes after the sec- 
ond call she stood motionless in 
front of the screen with no 
change in her expression. Then 
at last, with obvious reluctance, 
she made a call. 

The face that appeared this 
time was that of a young police 
sar. She did not miss the slight 
hardening of his expression when 
he saw her and realized what 
she was. 

“Vanessa Gort here,” she said. 
“Obviously you know I’m an 
elsie. Your name, please?” 

“Sar Smith. You’ll want to 
talk to the cap, of course. No 
elsie would waste her time with 
a mere sar.” 

“Wait. I’ve been threatened.” 

“With what?” 

“Disfiguration. You know what 
that means.” 

“To you, yes.” 

“To any woman.” 

“To you more than to a wom- 
an.” There was a subtle em- 
phasis on the word. He meant 
that she was an elsie, not a 
woman. 

“Sar,” she said wearily, “I 



have heard more insolence than 
you could heap on me if you 
devoted your entire life to it. 
After a time it provokes no re- 
action. Whether you hate elsies 
because you think they should 
not exist or because you want to 
be one yourself is irrelevant.” 
“All the same, I’ll tell you, 
Vanessa Gort. I hate them be- 
cause I think they shouldn’t ex- 
ist.” 

“Right, now we’ve disposed of 
that, can we go on? Or should 
I talk to your cap after all?” 
“You can talk to me. You’ve 
been threatened with disfigura- 
tion. Unless what?” 

“Unless I pay five million 
dols.” 

T he young sar began for the 
first time to look interested. 
“Not exactly a modest demand. 
Even from an elsie. May I ask 
how old you are?” 

“Over four hundred. I forget 
the exact figure. If you mean, 
could I pay, the answer is yes. 
I don’t choose to pay.” 
“Meanness?” 

“On principle.” 

“What was the man like?” 
“He wore a mask. He called 
himself the Avenger, a ridiculous 
melodramatic name. Incidental- 
ly, before you ask, I’ve never 
done anything that anybody 
could possibly want to avenge.” 
“In four hundred years?” 



THE MAN WHO KILLED IAAMORTALS 



111 



“Never — in four hundred 

years.” 

“Well, if you say so . How 
often has this man called?” 

“Three times.” 

“Good. If he’s called three 
times he’ll call again. And we’ll 
catch him.” 

There was a pause. 

“Is that all?” Vanessa asked. 

“Isn’t it enough? Are you of- 
ficially demanding protection?” 

“No. The man is probably, as 
you seem to think, a harmless 
crank. I don’t like making a fuss. 
I was reluctant to call you at 
all.” 

“So it seems, since you waited 
until he’d called three times. Do 
you plan to go out this after- 
noon?” 

“Only to the beauty salon in 
this building. I needn’t give you 
the address, I suppose.” 

“Quite unnecessary,” Smith 
agreed drily. “Although I don’t 
happen to know all about you 
offhand, it will be easy to ob- 
tain any information about you 
we may need. You have, after 
all, been around for four cen- 
turies.” 

“It will be all right to go to 
the salon?” 

“Better stay in your apart- 
ment.” 

“My private elevator admits 
me direct to the interior. And 
only clients with appointments 
are admitted.” She added sig- 



nificantly: “No men under any 
circumstances.” 

“Then I guess it’s okay, pro- 
vided you leave your apartment 
quite secure. I’ll report all this 
to Cap Zagreb, and he’ll decide 
what action to take.” 

II 

\ fter switching off, Sar Smith 
arranged to have all Vanes- 
sa Gort’s calls monitored, re- 
corded and traced. Then he got 
up and went to the file receiver. 

Why, he was wondering, was 
this sort of thing relatively un- 
common? Of course, considering 
the power the elsies controlled, 
only a fool or a brave man would 
attempt anything of the sort. 
But there were plenty of fools 
and brave men in the world. 

He turned the first scanner 
to ELSIE and the second to 
THREATS. Nothing happened, 
so he turned the second scan- 
ner to EXTORTION WITH 
MENACES. The third he set at 
SUMMARY, the fourth at LAST 
FIVE YEARS. Then he pressed 
the button. 

The printer began to chatter. 
In a matter of seconds he was 
able to tear off the first page. 

There had been no more than 
four attempts at extortion with 
menaces from elsies in the last 
five years — one in Germany, 
one in Italy, one in South Afri- 



112 



GALAXY 



ca and one in Australia, In each 
case the full might of the Elsie 
Council had been called in by 
the local authorities and the cri- 
minal had been found and im- 
prisoned before he had a chance 
to blow his nose. 

That was it, no doubt. You 
had more chance of robbing a 
bank successfully than of jost- 
ling an elsie in the street and 
getting away with it. Despots in 
ancient history had had the pow- 
er to have a man eviscerated so 
that they could warm their feet 
in the cavity of his abdomen. 
Although the elsies had no such 
power officially, their unofficial 
power made the ancient despots 
seem petty. 

Sar Smith was aware that he 
had been both a brave man and 
a fool to bait an elsie. If she 
wished, Vanessa Gort could get 
him fired and make it practi- 
cally impossible for him to get 
another job. 

The printer had already stop- 
ped. Four minor attempts at ex- 
tortion. No more. 

The file was, however, set 
for crime — which meant, by de- 
finition, acts by people respon- 
sible for their actions. Smith cut 
in the psychotic file and press- 
ed the button again. 

This time the printer was 
much busier. 

There were ninety-eight cases 
of threats by psychotics. Two 



elsies had actually been killed, 
one in South Africa and one in 
Greece. Nineteen had been in- 
jured. Again, all the psychotics 
responsible had been caught 
sooner or later. 

It figured, Smith thought. You 
didn’t threaten elsies if you were 
sane. If you were insane, even- 
tually somebody noticed it. 

\nn th the sheets from the 
printer in his hand he tap- 
ped on Cap Zagreb’s door. 

“Do come in,” Zagreb’s fruity 
voice invited. 

Smith entered. Zagreb, already 
overweight, was making matters 
worse by eating candied fruit. 

The faint astringency of the 
relationship between the cap and 
his sar could have been sensed 
at once had there been anyone 
present to sense it. Smith was 
young and sensitive ; Zagreb was 
ironically cynical. Smith was a 
plebeian cop and too conscious 
of it; Zagreb was a cultured pat- 
rician who might have been ex- 
pected to be an elsie instead of 
a police cap. Smith was 23; 
Zagreb was 57. 

“Well? Are you here on mat- 
ters of state, Smith, or is this 
merely a social call?” 

“A female elsie has been 
threatened, sir. Threatened with 
disfiguration by a masked man 
calling himself the Avenger. He 
has phoned three times.” 



114

“Hardly an unusual situation, 
Smith. It would be unusual, 
however, if anything were to 
come of it.” 

“Yes. sir.” 

“Has the lady a name? It’s 
not beyond the bounds of pos- 
sibility that I may have met her 
socially. I move in exalted cir- 
cles, Smith.” 

“Vanessa Gort.” 

“Indeed?” A candied apricot 
hung motionless in mid-air. “It 
behooves us to take the matter 
more seriously, Smith. Vanessa 
Gort is a woman of character.” 
“An elsie, sir.” 

“Quite. Immortals can possess 
character too, you know.” 

“You mean because she’s a 
woman of character the threat 
is less likely to be the work of 
a crank, sir?” 

“I mean that Vanessa Gort 
would not have reported the 
matter to us unless she thought 
it might not be. I assume you 
have taken the routine steps. 
Smith. She lives alone. Presum- 
ably you told her not to go out?” 
“She’s going to the beauty sa- 
lon in the same building, sir. I 
said it would be all right.” 

The phone rang. It was an 
emergency call on the sound- 
only police line. The cap picked 
up the receiver and listened. His 
expression did not change. 

“It was not,” he said, putting 
down the instrument. 



“Not what, sir?” Smith asked. 

“Not all right. Vanessa Gort 
has been slashed in the beauty 
salon. I think we’d better get 
over there at once.” 

13 ather to Smith’s relief, 
^ though he would never 
have admitted it, Zagreb him- 
self went straight to the Gort 
apartment, sending Smith to the 
beauty salon to find out what 
he could there. 

The proprietress, twittering 
with shock, was no help at all. 
The presence of a police sar in 
her salon seemed almost as in- 
credible to her as a knife attack 
on a client, and an elsie at that. 
(No men admitted under any 
circumstances, Vanessa Gort had 
said.) 

Nobody had seen what had 
happened. Miss Gort had been 
found in a pool of her own blood, 
quite conscious and rational. She 
had insisted on going right back 
to her apartment instead of 
waiting in the salon for a doc- 
tor. 

One of the manicurists was 
more helpful. The attack must, 
she said, have been by a woman 
who had given her name as Sara 
Blair, 137 Caxton Apartments. 
This woman had made an ap- 
pointment and had been photo- 
graphed when she arrived. But 
she had not kept her appoint- 
ment and was not in the salon. 



THE MAN WHO KILLED IMMORTALS 



115 



Indeed, nobody had seen her, 
with the possible exception of 
Vanessa Gort. 

“Yet she was photographed?” 
Smith said. 

Apparently every client was 
automatically photographed on 
arrival — a safeguard, Smith 
guessed, against subsequent non- 
payment of bills rather than 
against more spectacular crime. 

Smith took the photograph and 
looked up at the manicurist 
after a glance. “Do your clients 
often arrive dressed like this?” 

“Oh, yes. Those who live in 
the building arrive direct from 
their apartments. And we also 
have an autocar terminal.” 

“I see.” 

The photograph was a good, 
clear, full-length color picture of 
a very pretty girl with a towel 
round her hips and another over 
her shoulders. She wore gold 
slippers. 

Something not quite right 
about her strongly suggested that 
she was wearing a mask. That 
was obvious anyway. The face 
didn’t go with her figure. Al- 
though the loose towels conceal- 
ed the lines of her body better 
than a street dress, the impres- 
sion came through that Sara 
Blair was older than the eigh- 
teen-year-old face she wore. 

There was nothing more to be 
done in the salon. Sara Blair 
was probably still in her auto- 



car in one of the underground 
tunnels or overhead tubes, but 
there was no way of tracing it. 
It hardly seemed worth while 
racing to Caxton Apartments in 
the naive hope that the woman 
would emerge from the autocar 
terminal there. 

Zagreb admitted Smith to 
Vanessa Gort’s apartment. The 
injured elsie, her face bandaged, 
reclined on a divan. 

“You were wrong, Sar Smith,” 
she said through the bandages. 
“It was not safe for me to keep 
my appointment.” 

Smith opened his mouth, but 
it was Zagreb who answered. 
“We’ve been into that already, 
Miss Gort. There can be no al- 
legation that Sar Smith instruct- 
ed you not to remain in thi9 
apartment, as any sensible per- 
son who took the threats serious- 
ly would have done. The respon- 
sibility of going out was entirely 
yours. Smith assumed, as you 
evidently did yourself, that in a 
place which only women could 
enter you would be safe from a 
male extortionist. But you were 
attacked by a woman — which 
means that at least two people 
are involved.” 

The woman on the divan nod- 
ded wearily. “I’m making no 
complaint. But there can hardly 
be congratulation either. I guess 
you know what this means to 
me. No elsie can heal. Normal 



116 



SALAXY 



metabolism must be restored, at 
very considerable cost, for six 
weeks or more. At the end of 
that time I’ll be completely 
healed, true, with no visible scar, 
but I can only become an elsie 
again at the usual tremendous 
cost.” 

“I am sure,” Zagreb said 
smoothly, “that you are insur- 
ed.” 

“Of course I’m insured. Do 
you think that makes me quite 
happy to . oh, let it go.” 

“Perhaps you now wish that 
you had paid the five million 
demanded?” 

S he sat up. “Certainly not,” she 
said firmly. 

Zagreb nodded. “I understand. 
The . uh . Avenger was 
beyond all doubt a man?” 
“Beyond all doubt.” 

“And you were attacked by 
a woman. So two people are 
involved, people prepared to 
challenge the considerable power 
of the various elsie organizations 
which will undoubtedly take up 
this case ... I hesitate, for rea- 
sons of modesty, even to mention 
the efforts of Sar Smith and 
myself.” 

“I’ve been thinking about that. 
Anyone who knew me would 
know I’d refuse. I don’t think I 
was ever supposed to pay the 
money. I was supposed to re- 
fuse and be slashed.” 



Zagreb nodded again. “I am 
gratified to have my own theory 
so succinctly stated. You believe 
then, that this is the first move 
in a campaign to extort money 
from other elsies?” 

“Or myself, later.” 

“I think, given youi full co- 
operation, we can guarantee your 
safety from now on, Miss Gort. 
Although you have already told 
Sar Smith that you’ve never 
done anything that anyone could 
possibly want to avenge, I must 
ask you to make an effort of 
memory — ” 

“I’ve already done that. I’m 
quite certain. I don’t go around 
injuring people. I can think of 
nobody who could even believe 
himself or herself to have a gen- 
uine grievance against me.” 
“One other thing, then. Please 
describe your attacker in as 
much detail as possible.” 

“I scarcely saw her. It was in 
the corridor leading from the 
elevators. My name was spoken 
and I turned. I suppose I closed 
my eyes as the scalpel came at 
me — ” 

“Scalpel?” 

“Something like that. All I 
saw was that the woman was 
young, dark-haired, of average 
height. I half fainted. I don’t 
even know where she went.” 
While she was talking Smith 
had handed Zagreb the photo- 
graph of Sara Blair. When Zag- 



THE MAN WHO KILLED IMMORTALS 



117 



reb showed it to Vanessa, she 
said at once: “Yes. That’s her.” 
Zagreb gave the photograph 
back to Smith. “Well, go on, 
Smith. Find her.” 

“Sara Blair must be a false 
name, sir.” 

“Of course.” 

“She won’t be at this address.” 
“Naturally not.” 

“This isn’t her own face. She’s 
wearing a mask.” 

“One presumes so,” Zagreb 
sighed. “What are you waiting 
for?” 

Ill 

A t Caxton Apartments, by no 
means to his surprise, Smith 
drew a complete blank. Nobody 
knew a girl resembling Sara 
Blair, which was only to be ex- 
pected, since she would scarce- 
ly wear the same mask all over 
the city to enable the police 
to trace all her movements be- 
fore and after the attack. 

Smith considered checking on 
all the women in the block be- 
tween seventeen and forty-five, 
but when he found there were 
over five hundred of them he 
decided not to bother. 

When he returned to police 
HQ he found Zagreb eating a 
banana. 

“We are famous, Smith,” Zag- 
reb told him. “Or rather, in- 
famous.” 



He handed the sar a sheaf of 
photostats, clips from the news 
service prints which the HQ in- 
formation room monitored round 
the clock. Whenever anything 
happened anywhere, police HQ 
knew it at least as soon as the 
television news editors. 

“How did the news service get 
the story, sir?” Smith asked. 

“I gave it to them. I want 
this right out in the open. Smith. 
Extortionists and blackmailers 
thrive in the dark. They shrivel 
up and die in the full glare of 
public investigation.” 

Cap Zagreb was in charge of 
the case, the reports said. But 
there was already a suggestion 
that the Elsie Council would not 
be satisfied with a routine inves- 
tigation. 

“I guess not,” Smith said with 
dry bitterness. “Elsies are im- 
portant. Elsies matter. They’re 
the salt of the earth. They’re the 
people who can afford to buy 
immortality at something over 
a million dols a throw. And since 
they do go on living, power tends 
to get stuck in their hands. They 
don’t put up Presidents, police 
commissioners or governors, but 
they make sure they’re always 
in a position to put all the pres- 
sure they want on anybody who 
holds authority anywhere. The 
elsies are only one thousandth 
of the population, but they hold 
seventy per cent of the power.” 



118 



GALAXY 



Zagreb had been listening with 
polite interest. “Have you fin- 
ished, Smith?” he asked. 

“No, sir. The elsies have stop- 
ped space travel and everything 
else that they consider too dan- 
gerous for them. If we went 
into space and they didn’t, hu- 
man communities might grow up 
somewhere not under elsie con- 
trol. They’ve rebuilt every major 
city so that no elsie can get kill- 
ed in a street accident. They’ve 
taken over Florida as a Retreat 
for any elsie who doesn’t want 
to be contaminated by the very 
sight of an ordinary human be- 
ing. The Elsie Council fights 
every verbal, economic, social, 
psychological or physical attack 
on any elsie so fiercely that no- 
body dares to brush an elsie in 
the street or open his mouth 
about them.” 

“Come, now. It can scarcely 
be said, Smith, that you are not 
at this moment daring to open 
your mouth.” 

Ignoring this. Smith went on: 
“There’s only one elsie for every 
hundred thousand of us — yet 
the whole world is run for them.” 

“Do feel free, sar, to say any- 
thing more you wish.” 

nphe sar frowned at his super- 
ior. “Is there anything I’ve 
said that’s untrue, sir?” 

“You spoke the truth and 
nothing but the truth, but by no 



means the whole truth. If you 
had a million dols, Smith, would 
there be anything to stop you 
becoming an elsie?” 

“Nothing would ever make me 
join them, sir. I’m going to live 
out my life as a human being — 
not as a living corpse.” 

“There we have it, Smith. 
Immortals are known as elsies 
from the initials LC, indicating 
living corpse. Like many not 
exactly complimentary descrip- 
tions, the name has stuck. Im- 
mortals are, indeed, living 
corpses, and they’re not even 
immortal. It is as easy to kill an 
immortal as to kill anyone else. 
Cut them and they bleed — as 
we have recent cause to know. 
Elsies are merely people who 
do not age. Nothing more than 
that, nothing less.” 

“Cap, why are we talking like 
this?” Smith demanded. 

“You are young,” Zagreb ru- 
minated. “And intolerant. When 
you’re older you will not, one 
hopes, make such definite state- 
ments before learning all the 
facts.” 

“What facts don’t I know, sir? 
What’s the big secret?” 

“No secret, Smith. Nothing 
you could not find out if you 
wished. The trouble is you don’t 
wish. I suspect, for instance, that 
you assume unthinkingly that 
elsies are rich simply because 
they’re elsies.” 



THE MAN WHO KILLED IMMORTALS

Qrnith looked surprised. As a 
^ matter of fact, he did. “Since 
the process costs over a million 
and it has to be done before 
you’re thirty-five, it stands to 
reason — ” 

“I’m not talking about that, 
precisely. Most elsies are treat- 
ed at the expense of parents 
too old, by the time they make 
their pile, to become elsies them- 
selves. What I mean is: how, 
simply by living indefinitely, 
does one become very rich?” 
“You can invest money at 
compound interest and wait until 
it multiplies itself.” 

“True, but where does the 
money come from and what do 
you live on while it grows?” 
“Parents who can pay a mil- 
lion usually leave quite a bit 
when they die.” 

“Also true, but you’re still 
missing the point, sar. The long- 
er you live the more you spend. 
Vanessa Gort has spent, on a 
rough estimate, some twenty-five 
million dols and probably pos- 
sesses at least ten million more. 
Where did she get it?” 

“She was left money, I guess.” 
“She was left nothing but im- 
mortality. Four centuries ago, 
at the age of twenty-five, she 
received no legacy from her fath- 
er but the elsie treatment.” 
“Then other legacies since — ” 
“It doesn’t work that way. 
Smith. It never has. Property 



passes forward, not backwards. 
Brothers and sisters and cousins 
of elsies leave their money to 
their own children, and it keeps 
going right on down — never 
back to the great-aunt or great- 
great-uncle who became an elsie. 
Go on, sar. Tell me where elsies 
get their money.” 

“If you go on living for cen- 
turies — ” 

“I’ve told you,” Zagreb sighed, 
“going on living isn’t enough. 
What else do elsies have to do?” 
“Work, I guess.” 

“Exactly. Elsies who become 
rich and powerful and important 
have to work for their riches and 
power and importance.” 

“And what does that prove, 
sir?” 

For the first time Zagreb show- 
ed exasperation. “If you can’t 
see that for yourself. Smith, I 
wonder how you ever manage to 
catch the most incompetent cri- 
minal — ” 

c~>phe visiphone on Zagreb’s desk 
buzzed peremptorily. Know- 
ing all calls were monitored, the 
cap switched on at once. No 
call switched through to him 
could be refused. 

“Cap Zagreb,” he said. 

The lean face on the screen 
said: “I’m Henry Fax, president 
of the Elsie Council.” 

“Yes,” Zagreb said. “I’ve been 
expecting you to call.”

“Zagreb, we’re not going to 
interfere in any way with your 
investigation into the Gort case. 
But as you can understand, the 
criminal simply must be found. 
Anything you want, absolutely 
anything, will be arranged the 
moment you request it.” 

“Thank you. The police or- 
ganization is, however, moderate- 
ly well equipped and staffed.” 
“Kind of thing I mean. Your 
sar just made inquiries about 
Sara Blair at Caxton Apart- 
ments. If you want the entire 
list of 1327 occupants checked 
out by private investigators, just 
say the word.” 

“I’ll bear your offer in mind, 
Mr. Fax.” 

“Or if you want a law passed 
so that any area in which this 
criminal is known to be can be 
closed off, even a whole city, let 
me know.” 

“I shall, Mr. Fax, I shall.” 
“Another thing — suppose all 
wearing of masks was banned. 
That might simplify matters for 
you.” 

“It might. And again, we might 
find all our time and attention 
taken up with charging people 
who were doing nothing more cri- 
minal than wearing a mask. One 
small thing occurs to me. I’d like 
the unofficial assistance of a fe- 
male elsie. A volunteer, of course 
— to work with my sar.” 
Smith’s head jerked up. 



“There might be danger for 
this . volunteer?” Fax said. 

“There appears to be danger 
for all elsies at the moment. Ad- 
mittedly anyone who offered to 
help might find herself with more 
than her fair share.” 

“I’ll find somebody.” 

HP agreb completed his arrange- 
ments with Henry Fax and 
switched off. 

“Cap, what’s in your mind?” 
Smith demanded. 

“Vagueness. One of my vague 
ideas is that you may have to 
become an elsie.” 

“Huh?” 

“In name and appearance 
only, of course.” 

“You can tell an elsie at a 
glance.” 

“How, Smith?” 

“You know as well as I do, 
sir.” 

“Tell me all the same. How 
do you instantly recognize an 
elsie as such?” 

“Well . take two ordinary 
girls, one twenty-two and one 
twenty-eight. The girl of twenty- 
two isn’t exactly in early ado- 
lescence, and the girl of twenty- 
eight hasn’t even started to de- 
cay. Yet most people can tell 
that one is about twenty-two and 
the other about twenty-eight.” 
Zagreb nodded. 

“How do you tell that a girl’s 
twenty-eight and not twenty- 



THE MAN WHO KILLED IMMORTALS 



121 




two? I guess by her eyes, ex- 
pression, maturity, experience 
. It’s not lines or skin flaws 
or anything like that. A girl of 
twenty-eight can be lineless and 
flawless. Yet you still know. Now 
take a woman who’s lived one 
hundred sixty-five years. She can 
have the body of an eighteen- 
year-old girl and the most per- 
fect complexion you ever saw. 
She usually does. Yet you only 
have to glance at her and you 
know she’s an elsie.” 

“Precisely. So take an elsie 
who really is twenty-five. How 
do you know then?” 

“Well . you don’t sir.” 
“Quod erat demonstrandum. 
Meantime, however, since I ex- 



pect it will take some time for 
the situation to develop, all I 
want you to do is visit all the 
elsies in this area and ask if 
they have been threatened.” 
“Yes, sir.” This was a normal, 
routine assignment. Vanessa Gort 
might or might not be the first 
elsie threatened by Sara Blair 
and her partner. The others, if 
any, might or might not have 
paid up quietly. It was obviously 
sensible to find out. 

“We’ll continue our interesting 
discussion on the rights and 
wrongs of the elsie situation lat- 
er,” Zagreb said. “Meantime, 
write your report and get on 
with your job.” 

“No further orders, sir?”

The Zagreb eyebrows went up 
in his characteristic expression 
of pained surprise. “Have I ever 
tied your hands, Smith?” 

“No, sir.” 

“Have I not always shown a 
rather touching faith in the ca- 
pabilities of my assistants?” 
“You could put it that way, 
sir. They might say that you 
expect miracles.” 

“Very well, Smith. Go thou 
and perform a miracle.” 

IV 

^Tphree days and six elsies later, 
Smith had to admit to him- 
self that there had been some 
justification for Zagreb’s accu- 



sation that he had sounded off 
about elsies without knowing 
much about them. Although 
meeting and talking to elsies did 
not change Smith’s views in any 
significant particular, he realiz- 
ed that there was more to being 
an immortal than met the eye, 

Homer Daniels was a quiet 
little man who didn’t want any- 
one to know he was an elsie. In 
the nature of things this was 
impossible. He did, however, do 
his best by living quietly, chang- 
ing his abode regularly, and in- 
variably going out masked. 

Smith was forced to admit that 
Daniels was no megalomaniac 
and that there was little luxury 
in his life. He had given up prac- 



IHE MAN WHO KILLED IMMORTALS 



123 



tically everything for one thing 
only: perpetual stalemate in the 
battle of life and death. 

Blanche Morton was a nym- 
phomaniac. The number of men 
she had had, or vice versa, must 
be staggering, since she had liv- 
ed for three hundred years and 
still had the body of a girl of 
eighteen. Smith suspected that 
what she got from immortality, 
what she wanted, was not really 
eternal life. It was, first, the 
reassurance that whether, how- 
ever and whenever she did even- 
tually die, she would never have 
known old or even middle age; 
and, second, the certainty that 
no elsie could have children. 

Jim Stephens lived an eternal 
life of terror. He knew that any 
major scratch would be enough 
to force him to surrender his 
immortality, and that there was 
no guarantee that the restoration 
process would be entirely suc- 
cessful. He had nearly died the 
first time. He was convinced he 
would die the second time. Er- 
go, a scratch would kill him. So 
he guarded himself like a for- 
tune in fine crystal. 

Helen Bauer was that rarity, 
an elsie who had not had the 
treatment until she was in her 
forties, and yet had survived. 
Smith envied her least of all. 
Suspension in eternal youth was 
one thing, suspension in middle 
age quite another. 



Jo Seymour was perhaps the 
best adjusted of the six. She 
had fun, she had a vast fortune, 
and she was sufficiently free of 
Stephen’s terror to ski and skate 
and swim. She had undergone 
the treatment four times after 
injury. 

Blake Smedley was the only 
one of the six who resembled 
Smith’s theoretical elsie. He had 
vast power and he liked to use 
it. No mask for him. When he 
strode into the non-elsie world, 
everything about him proclaimed 
that he was one of the elite. 

\ 11 denied having been threat- 
ened. 

“But Stephens is worth watch- 
ing,” Smith reported to Zagreb. 
“Either he’s lying or he soon will 
be approached. When he is, he’ll 
pay.” 

“Stephens,” Zagreb ruminated, 
“being the one who’s terrified he 
may cut his finger?” 

“He’ll never cut his finger, 
sir. I was searched before I saw 
him to make sure I carried noth- 
ing as dangerous as a pin. There 
isn’t a knife in the house that 
would cut anything tougher than 
butter.” 

“Do I detect a certain diminu- 
tion in your jealousy of elsies, 
Smith?” 

“Jealousy, sir? I was never jeal- 
ous of them.” 

“No? Well, let that pass. When 



124 



GALAXY 



we were interrupted in our pre- 
vious discussion, I had pointed 
out that no one with a million 
dols is excluded from the ranks 
of elsies. Since the treatment 
costs a million dols, demanding 
greater skill than any surgical 
operation ever performed, is 
there anything unfair about 
this?” 

“I didn’t say it was unfair.” 

“No? I was under the impres- 
sion you did. However. Payment 
of a million dols by no means 
guarantees success. In some forty 
per cent of all cases, immediate 
death results. In another thirty 
per cent, although the treatment 
is not fatal, it is not successful 
either. Of course, they can try 
again. Thus of those who can 
pay and want to become elsies, 
only forty-two per cent succeed.” 

“I don’t quite get your drift, 
sir.” 

“Perhaps not . perhaps I 
have no drift, Smith. But remem- 
ber this — only the cream of the 
men and women who become 
elsies do last for centuries. You 
know perfectly well that the 
suicide rate among elsies is high. 
Ironic, isn’t it? A less spectacular 
thinning of the ranks occurs in 
a very natural way: most elsies 
who have to revert to normal 
metabolism in order to heal sim- 
ply don’t have the cash for the 
restoration process.” 

“Well, sir?” 



“So the elsies who have been 
around for a long time are on 
the whole highly intelligent, com- 
petent, prudent, successful men 
and women.” 

“Maybe.” 

“I’ll accept that somewhat 
grudging admission and go on. 
Then I must point out that we 
share in all the benefits which 
the elsies have provided for 
themselves. I believe you said — 
quote — they’ve rebuilt every 
major city so that no elsie can 
get killed in a street accident — 
unquote. How many non-elsies 
get killed in street accidents in 
such cities, Smith?” 

“None, sir.” 

“Quite. You also remarked 
that they took over Florida as 
an Elsie Retreat — by force of 
arms, Smith?” 

“No, sir. They paid for it. Bil- 
lions. 

“Once again, quite. Talking of 
the Retreat, Smith — you are go- 
ing there.” 

“I, sir? I’m not an elsie.” 
“You will not go as Sar Smith. 
Nor will you go alone. But first 
— there have been more threats.” 
“You didn’t tell me.” 

“I’m telling you now. Three 
elsies in other cities have been 
threatened. They all departed 
immediately for the Retreat.” 
“Well, that’s sensible. They’re 
safe there.” 

“None of the calls were traced, 



THE MAN WHO KILLED IMMORTALS 



125 



but we have recordings of two 
of them. The elsies concerned 
had taken the precaution of re- 
cording all calls.” 

“Pity they didn’t go further 
and let us trace all their calls.” 
“They did. I should not have 
said the calls were untraced, but 
that the information didn’t help 
us It only takes a moment to 
step out of a public call-box and 
get very thoroughly lost . 
Let’s watch the recordings.” 

Tie pressed a switch. A blank 
face came on the screen. It 
was a poor mask. The quality of 
face masks depended, naturally, 
on their expense. A mask like 
this was obviously a mask, but 
it effectively concealed the iden- 
tity of the wearer nevertheless. 
A mask like the one worn by 
Sara Blair would have needed 
very close examination before it 
could be identified as a mask. 

“Cyril Black,” the blank face 
said, “this is the Avenger. You 
will pay five million dols or what 
happened to Vanessa Gort will 
also happen to you. Since you’re 
a man, a threat to your face 
might not perhaps be so effec- 
tive. Your belly will be slashed 
and you will suffer a good deal 
of pain.” 

The screen went blank. 

“That all?” Smith said. “No 
answer expected, no arrange- 
ment for collecting the cash?” 



“Evidently this is a prelimi- 
nary call, made to see what Cyril 
Black would do. What he did 
do was depart for the Retreat — 
as thousands of other elsies are 
doing.” 

“There’s room for them,” 
Smith said drily. “Florida at one 
time had a population of twenty- 
five million. And there are only 
about thirty-five thousand elsies 
in the whole world.” 

“True. Let’s watch the second 
recording.” 

Zagreb pressed the switch 
again. This time it was the face 
of a girl which appeared. It was 
the face of Sara Blair. She said: 
“Betty Slessinger, Vanessa 
Gort is a friend of yours. She 
refused to pay five million. I’m 
sure . you won’t.” 

Smith blinked as the face ab- 
ruptly disappeared. The message 
was certainly short, if not sweet. 

“You’ve had the voices ana- 
lyzed?” he said. 

“Unfortunately the extortion- 
ists have heard about voice iden- 
tification as well as face and 
fingerprint identification. The 
voices in both cases were modi- 
fied by throat resonators. Betty 
Slessinger also departed for the 
Retreat — she is there now.” 
Zagreb reached out toward the 
intercom. “Send in the lady 
when she arrives.” 

“She’s just come, sir.” 

“Very well, send her in now.” 



126 



GALAXY 



“That’s the elsie volunteer? 
Who is she?” 

“You’ll see in a moment.” 
“What’s the idea, sir?” 

“As a twenty-five-year-old el- 
sie alone, you wouldn’t fool any- 
one for long Smith. As the com- 
panion of the volunteer whom 
Henry Fax has found for us, 
you should have no trouble be- 
ing as conspicuous or inconspi- 
cuous as you like.” 

The door opened and Jo Sey- 
mour came in. Of course. She 
was the only elsie Smith had 
come across who took chances 
with her precious eternal youth 
and didn’t squeal when they 
didn’t come off. 

Qmith and Jo Seymour were at 
^ the airport, and Smith was 
just about to don the identity of 
Frank Sharp, a genuine twenty- 
five-year-old English elsie who 
had agreed to stay under cover 
until further notice, when an air- 
port cop came and told him he 
was wanted at police HQ. 

“Miss Seymour can wait here,” 
the cop said. “You won’t be 
long. You’ll catch the next 
plane.” 

Zagreb wasted no time when 
Smith arrived. “Things have 
happened,” he said with unusual 
terseness. “The Avenger tried 
to slash Blake Smedley, but fail- 
ed. He was lucky to get away. 
It was a rather poor effort — yet 



the fact that such an attempt 
was made, without a prior de- 
mand for money, has naturally 
worried elsies all over the world 
quite considerably. The other 
thing has worried them even 
more. Betty Slessinger had been 
slashed inside the Retreat.” 
“Inside the Retreat?” Smith 
exclaimed. “But nobody who 
isn’t an elsie can possibly get 
inside.” 

“You seem to forget that you 
are on your way there your- 
self. And that you will certain- 
ly get inside.” 

“But the Elsie Council knows 
about me, sir.” 

“Yes. It should be remember- 
ed, stringent as the precautions 
are, that no foolproof check has 
so far been made on arrivals 
at the Retreat. It should also 
be remembered that instead of 
perhaps a dozen arrivals a day, 
the check-points have recently 
had to deal with thousands. How- 
ever it happened, Sara Blair 
most certainly did get in the Re- 
treat. And there she slashed 
Betty Slessinger exactly as Van- 
essa Gort was slashed.” 

“You’re sure it’s Sara Blair?” 
“I am. There’s another pho- 
tograph.” He passed it across the 
table. 

It was a poor photograph, tak- 
en by a camera which was part 
of a very elementary alarm sys- 
tem — the kind that might be 



THE MAN WHO KILLED IMMORTALS 



127 



expected to be installed in 
houses inside the Retreat if there 
was an alarm system at all. 

Poor as it was, the girl who 
was shown running from the 
house was undoubtedly Sara 
Blair, wearing her usual mask. 

“Something bothers you, 
Smith?” Zagreb inquired, after 
a pause. 

“The whole picture, sir. Van- 
essa Gort was threatened. Any- 
one who knew her knew she 
wouldn’t pay. She was slashed. 
Smedley wasn’t even threatened, 
yet the Avenger tried to get him. 
Betty Slessinger was threatened 
but given no chance to pay. She 
was slashed — ” 

“Where does this lead us?” 
Zagreb asked, with an expression 
which suggested he was already 
there. 

“It’s not extortion at all, sir. 
The Avenger really believes he 
has something to avenge. He just 
hates elsies.” 

Zagreb leaned back and ex- 
amined the ceiling. “Such a 
scheme would, I presume, have 
your entire approval, Smith?” 

“It’s my job to catch whoever’s 
behind it, sir.” 

“Exactly. Now you can con- 
tinue your journey to the Re- 
treat — knowing that Sara Blair 
is there.” 

“Someone who could get in 
could get out.” 

“Not so, Smith. At the begin- 



ning of all campaigns mistakes 
are made. This one is no excep- 
tion. Then organization is tight- 
ened up, and fewer mistakes are 
made. You can take my word for 
it that however masked, dressed, 
disguised or transported, Sara 
Blair will not get out of the Re- 
treat.” 

“So I’m to catch her, sir?” 

“You are.” 

“I’ll get back to the airport 
then, sir, if that’s all.” 

“Do that, Smith. One further 
thing. Although I propose to re- 
main here at the moment, if 
there are any further develop- 
ments within the Retreat, I shall 
ask the Elsie Council to invite 
me in officially and openly. It 
would, of course, be more con- 
venient if you succeeded in solv- 
ing the whole affair without my 
assistance — ” 

“But that, sir, is hardly to be 
expected,” said Smith drily. 

“No,” Zagreb sighed. 

V 

T?ven on short air journeys el- 
sies like Jo Seymour were 
acctistomed to the luxury of a 
private cabin. Smith, masked and 
dressed as Frank Sharp, was 
therefore able to talk freely to 
her. 

His attitude toward Jo Sey- 
mour, whom he had now met five 
times, was ambivalent. She was 



128 



GALAXY 



an elsie, and he still disliked and 
resented elsies for an amalgam 
of reasons; yet she was the elsie 
he liked best. So a man who 
hated all Spaniards might say 
grudgingly of a particular man: 
he’s okay — for a Spaniard. 

Her two centuries of life had 
left no physical mark on her ex- 
cept for a few minor scars, the 
result of playgirl accidents. From 
her mind they had removed all 
petty resentment and desire to 
score off her fellow-beings, elsie 
or otherwise. 

“Well?” she invited, soon after 
takeoff. “Do you tell me what’s 
happened, or don’t you?” 

She was sitting demurely on 
a massive-looking window seat, 
her back to the clouds. Her dress 
was red, short, and highly provo- 
cative. And Smith was provoked. 

“That depends,” he said. 
“How close are you and I sup- 
posed to be?” 

“Not as close as you might 
think,” she said, smiling. “Men 
are not a particular weakness of 
mine.” 

“You’d travel about with a 
guy like Frank Sharp and live 
in the same house with him and 
sleep alone?” 

“Yes. Elsies don’t have to be 
in a hurry.” 

“I see.” Anyway, he told her 
what had happened and asked 
her: “From your experience as 
an elsie, would you say that the 



Avenger and his girl-friend could 
possibly be elsies?” 

“It isn’t likely, is it?” 

“It’s more likely now than it 
was. Plenty of crooks of one 
kind or another have tried to 
get into the Retreat, knowing 
how much loot in cash and valu- 
ables is lying around inside, and 
knowing there are no cops. But 
nobody ever succeeded. How did 
Sara Blair manage it if she isn’t 
an elsie?” 

“Slipped in with the crowd.” 
“Maybe. Anyway, how about 
answering the question? Could 
elsies try anything like this?” 

Jo considered the question ser- 
iously. “They’d have to be utter- 
ly desperate. And I don’t think 
they’d get away with it. You 
see, there aren’t all that many 
elsies and we live a long time. 
I don’t say every elsie knows 
every other elsie, but we know 
each other and about each other 
pretty well. If an elsie existed 
who was capable of this sort of 
thing, somebody would know, 
would tell the Elsie Council, and 
they’d get at the truth in a mat- 
ter of hours.” 

“It could be the work of a 
couple of elsie psychopaths.” 

Jo shook her head definitely. 
“The Council knows all about 
the psychotics among us. There 
aren’t so many, you know. 
Known psychopaths aren’t ac- 
ed for treatment, and the treat- 



THE MAN WHO KILLED IAAMORTALS 



129 



ment tends to prevent the oc- 
currence of major psychological 
upsets. Besides — psychopaths 
generally work alone. You don’t 
get two of them cooperating 
smoothly on the same crazy 
scheme.” 

“Maybe one wants money and 
the other is crazy.” 

“Perhaps.” 

''T'here was no opportunity for 
* further discussion, for the 
plane was already landing ten 
miles outside the border of the 
Retreat. No flying was permit- 
ted over the area; any ship of 
any kind which tried it was auto- 
matically destroyed by chaser 
missiles. Approach by sea was 
equally impossible. The only 
way in or out was through the 
seven checkpoints. 

Despite his disguise and being 
in the company of a genuine el- 
sie, Smith would have stood no 
chance of getting inside the Re- 
treat had he not arrived, by ar- 
rangement, at a checkpoint 
where Henry Fax himself had 
taken charge of the screening. 

None of the other elsies who 
arrived at the same time, half a 
dozen or so, could have noticed 
anything out of the ordinary 
about the way Smith was treat- 
ed. The only difference was that 
the result of the tests made on 
him was ignored. 

Given a blood sample, it was 



quite easy to determine whether 
a person was an elsie or not. The 
perpetual youth process halted 
the diminution of the elasticity 
of the coats of the arteries. The 
capillaries therefore remained 
sufficiently supplied, and the 
normal progress of senility was 
permanently frozen — at costs 
which were well known. The 
whole organism replaced its cells 
with machine-like regularity and 
exactitude. No major change was 
allowed to take place. Thus el- 
si es remained at the same height 
and weight, immune to age, 
immune to disease — but terri- 
fyingly vulnerable to the slight- 
est injury. 

So no blood sample was ever 
taken from an elsie. The prick 
never healed, the blood removed 
never replaced itself. You 
couldn’t have a frozen metabolic 
pattern and at the same time 
obligingly versatile cells which 
took over the functions of dif- 
ferent cells. 

Elsie’s bodies were like intri- 
cate charcoal sketches waxed 
over. So long as the wax was 
undamaged, the sketches lasted 
for ever. Once the wax was 
broken, the charcoal became 
mere loose carbon, as vulnerable 
as sand castles washed by the 
tide of time. 

The new tightened check no 
longer relied on documents, the 
Elsie Register and a psychologi- 



130 



GALAXY 



cal and memory test. It was bas- 
ed, prosaically, on the fact that 
no matter how much elsies ate 
or drank, they had to return to 
a basic weight. Thus above a 
certain level of nourishment the 
body simply refused to accept 
food. It was rejected one way 
or another practically unmodi- 
fied. 

This test was unpleasant and 
slow, but it was certain. 

“You’re Henry Fax, aren’t 
you?” Smith-Sharp asked as he 
ate his third meal in two hours. 
“You don’t usually spend your 
time working as a frontier guard, 
do you?” 

“I don’t,” said Fax grimly, 
“but this area really is a retreat 
now. There are twenty-five thou- 
'sand of us here. That only 
leaves about eight thousand el- 
sies in the rest of the world.” 

“Are elsies still flocking here, 
then?” Smith asked. “Despite 
the news?” 

“You mean that Sara Blair is 
in the Retreat. No, they’re not. 
You can see for yourself. Thou- 
sands in the last few days, a 
handful today. Mostly our peo- 
ple want out, not in. We’re not 
letting them out.” 

“Why not?” 

“We know that Sara Blair 
is inside,” said Fax slowly. 
“Whatever happens — whatever 
happens — nobody leaves the 
Retreat until she’s found.” 




THE MAN WHO KILLED IMMORTALS

The message, Smith rightly as- 
sumed, was not intended foi 
Frank Sharp but for Sar Smith. 

nphte Retreat was a playground 
for gods and goddesses, every 
one of whom had an Achilles 
heel The only transport was a 
railcar system. There were never 
any mishaps on rail journeys 
and nobody could possibly be 
hurt in street accidents. There 
were no animals or reptiles. The 
face of the whole terrain had 
been carefully smoothed so that 
it was very difficult to fall from 
any height. Every possible safe- 
guard in the rivers and lakes 
guarded against swimming acci- 
dents. and there was no water- 
skiing. The promenades were of 
soft plastic and no flight of 
stens lacked a banister. 

It was like the court where 
nothing existed which might 
prick the princess’s finger. 

Inside the Retreat, the etern- 
ally youthful elsies lived in a 
country-club life denuded of all 
physically dangerous pursuits. 
Tennis, swimming, sunbathing, 
carefully stewarded golf, walk- 
ing. parties and gambling were 
in: climbing, riding, all kinds of 
shooting, fencing and sparring 
were out. Even bicycles were for- 
bidden. Too many people fell off 
bicycles, they could travel too 
fast, and there were bicycle-pe- 
destrian accidents. 



There was no law enforce- 
ment. There didn’t need to be. 
Elsies didn’t run the risk of 
being punished by elsies, of be- 
ing outlawed. More than that, 
they didn’t run the risk of injury. 
Only Jo Seymour and a few 
others took such risks, and they 
took care not to involve any 
other elsies. 

Expenses in the Retreat were 
enormous, and for no high stan- 
dard of luxury at that. The rea- 
son was simply that since no- 
body but elsies was allowed in, 
elsies had to do all the work — 
all the cooking, serving, clean- 
ing, repairing, lifting and carry- 
ing. Only those who needed the 
money would do it, and only for 
an extortionate return. 

Smith saw only a little of 
this on his first day in the Re- 
treat, for he and Jo were not 
released inside until early eve- 
ning. The checkpoint closed at 
night. 

Invited to a party a few hours 
later at Henry Fax’s enormous 
mansion, they had accepted. It 
was no part of Smith’s assign- 
ment to sit at home in the chalet 
Jo Seymour maintained by the 
side of a lake. He had to see 
everything that there was to see. 

Jo’s chalet being less than 
half a mile from Henry Fax’s 
house, they went to the chalet 
first, opened it up, showered 
and changed, and then walked 



132 



GALAXY 



to the party, there being no other 
way of getting there. 

For a moment, when Smith 
entered the huge ballroom with 
Jo, the blaze of light blinded 
him. Then, when he was able to 
take in the scene, what he saw 
dazed and shocked him. 

He had arrived at parties be- 
fore, cold sober, when everyone 
present was already in an ad- 
vanced stage of hysterical, fren- 
etic inebriation. And although he 
had seldom been present as a 
guest at any particularly wild 
party, he had attended quite a 
few parties of this type in the line 
of duty. 

He had never seen anything 
like this. 

Beside him, Jo murmured: 
“Don’t look like that, or every- 
body will know you’re not one 
of us.” 

It was necessary for her to 
warn him, he admitted, but the 
phrasing saddened and sickened 
him. 

She was saying that she was 
one of this crowd. 

Smith was aware academically 
that elsies could get drunker 
than anyone else. Normal meta- 
bolism allowed the intake of 
only so much alcohol and then 
took drastic measures to stop it. 
Elsies could drink whisky like 
lemonade, getting rid of the 
bulk within a very short time and 
retaining the alcohol. 



I n the middle of the floor the 
men and women who were 
still capable of dancing danced. 
They were a handsome lot. No 
one looked older than twenty- 
five, and those who were still 
dancing hadn’t reached the stage 
that most of the others had. 

Most of the girls and some 
of the men sprawled around had 
removed at least part of their 
clothing. (Perhaps, Smith had 
to admit to himself, non-elsie 
parties might have different con- 
ventions on this kind of exhi- 
bitionism if everybody present 
had the kind of shape which 
could stand being revealed.) 

Elsies had to get into the best 
possible physical shape during 
the initial treatment. Thereafter 
they kept this same shape, per- 
haps for centuries. 

The only woman present who 
did not have the kind of figure 
which could stand revelation was 
Helen Bauer. And she, Smith 
observed, was taking no part in 
the dmateur strip-tease. 

So this was how the people 
who really mattered enjoyed 
themselves. 

“Dance?” said Jo. 

Smith nodded, and they mov- 
ed onto the floor. 

Half an hour later, when they 
went out on the veranda for air, 
he said curtly: “I don’t think 
much of elsie parties. Are they 
always like this?” 



THE MAN WHO KILLED IMMORTALS 



133 



“No,” Jo said. “Haven’t you 
noticed something? I haven’t had 
more than a couple of drinks. 
Neither has Henry Fax. The 
girl who’s operating the music 
isn’t drinking at all. Helen Bauer 
is as sober as we are. So are a 
dozen others — the ones who are 
the least scared.” 

“I see. The Avenger and his 
girl friend really have this lot 
worried. So they drink them- 
selves incapable.” 

“That’s about it. Can you 
blame them?” 

“Easily,” said Smith drily, “but 
it’s no part of my job.” 

They went inside and danced 
again. Smith would have prefer- 
red to stay exclusively in Jo’s 
company, but he wouldn’t learn 
much that way. He therefore let 
himself be introduced to anyone 
who could still talk. 

He had three invitations to 
private parties consisting of two, 
taking place at once somewhere 
within the huge house. 

“And really,” Jo said the next 
time they took the air, “if you 
particularly want to avoid sus- 
picion that you’re not an elsie, 
you shouldn’t turn them down 
so bluntly. At least half a dozen 
people have been asking me 
about you. They’re not suspi- 
cious, exactly, they just wonder 
who you are and how a man 
like you comes to be here.” 
Smith grunted. 



They were leaving the party 
an hour later when uproar broke 
out. A girl out on the veranda 
was screaming. 

Smith ran to the veranda and 
pushed his way through the chat- 
tering, terrified, suddenly sober 
men and women who were star- 
ing in fascination at what the 
screaming girl had found. 

Henry Fax lay on the ground, 
his throat cut so deeply that 
his head was almost severed 
from his body. 

VI 

Omith did not elect to an- 
^ nounce his identity and 
start taking statements from 
everybody at the party. With a 
team of detectives to guard the 
doors, herd the guests together 
and take the house and gardens 
apart in search of the smallest 
clue, he might have been able 
to accomplish something. As it 
was, with no disciplined, trained 
men he could call upon, he pre- 
ferred to remain Frank Sharp 
and see what he could see, 
which wasn’t much. 

Zagreb arrived with the dawn. 
There was no pretense that he 
was an elsie: the headless Elsie 
Council brought him into the 
Retreat by special dispensation, 
prepared to try anything that 
might result in the capture of 
the Avenger and Sara Blair. 



134 



GALAXY 



He found Smith on the ver- 
anda overlooking the lake. Jo 
was having a swim before break- 
fast. 

“If you enjoy seeing elsies 
worried, Smith,” Zagreb said 
grimly, “you’re going to have a 
ball. Nothing you’ve seen so far 
can compare with what you’ll 
see today.” 

“How’s that, sir?” 

“The Avenger has sent his first 
real demand to the newspapers. 
The news should be breaking all 
over the Retreat about now. He 
wants fifty million. Not from 
any particular elsie, but from 
elsies in general. Unless the Elsie 
Council agrees within twenty- 
four hours, elsies inside and out- 
side the Retreat are not merely 
going to be slashed. They’re 
going to die, like Henry Fax.” 

Smith said nothing. Jo, curious, 
swam to the landing-stage below 
the veranda and climbed out. 
The early morning sun caught 
the droplets on her skin and turn- 
ed them into gold. As she stood 
slim and erect by the rail, hear- 
ing the news from Zagreb, two 
things fought for Smith’s whole 
attention: the temptation to get 
rid of Zagreb somehow, anyhow, 
and carry Jo, willing or unwill- 
ing, inside the chalet; and the 
sudden realization that Jo’s pre- 
sent appearance, entirely typical 
of girl elsies, was highly signifi- 
cant. 



Duty won. “Sir,” he said, “I 
think I can tell you who Sara 
Blair is.” 

1 4'\7"ou’ve found something 
out?” said Zagreb. 

“No. I just thought of some- 
thing, that’s all.” 

Jo was watching him steadily, 
patiently. 

“Something I don’t know?” 
Zagreb demanded. “Something 
you’ve noticed since coming to 
the Retreat?” 

“No, sir. Nothing you don’t 
know. It was you who told me 
that I’d only manage to pass as 
an elsie among elsies if I took 
the identity of a known, recent, 
genuine elsie.” 

“Oh.” Zagreb was disappoint- 
ed. “If that’s all . my dear 
Smith, naturally we’ve checked 
that angle. It leads nowhere.” 

“It was you, too, who made 
me admit that elsies are gener- 
ally competent and efficient.” 

“Well?” 

“If you recall what we know 
of the Avenger and of Sara Blair, 
you’ll agree that everything the 
woman has done has been ef- 
fective and the man has made 
a botch of the one thing he’s 
tried. It’s also important that 
at a time when nearly every 
elsie is within the Retreat, the 
woman is inside and the man 
has to stay outside, sending de- 
mands to newspapers.” 



THE MAN WHO KILLED IAAMORTALS 



135 



‘‘All right,” Zagreb said. “As- 
sume the woman is an elsie and 
the man is not. How does that 
help us?” 

“Jo told me that if an elsie 
was involved in such a scheme, 
he or she would have to be des- 
perate. Blair is an elsie and des- 
perate; the Avenger, whether 
desperate or not, is no elsie 
What does that suggest?” 
“Blackmail?” 

“Something stronger that that, 
1 think. Love. Blair wants the 
man to join her as an elsie. But 
neither of them has a million 
dols. I guess the Avenger is ap- 
proaching the top age limit — 
if he doesn’t get the treatment 
soon it’ll be too late.” 

“Ingenious as all this undoubt- 
edly is, it’s nothing more than a 
series of guesses.” 

“Until you look at Jo, sir.” 

Jo had not said a word. She 
started slightly at this. 

“At Miss Seymour?” Zagreb 
said. “If you’re going to tell me 
that Jo Seymour is Sara Blair, 
Smith, I really must — ” 

“No, sir. I said look at her.” 
They looked at her. Her green 
swimsuit was slit narrowly from 
breast to hip, showing the un- 
canny elsie absence of bulge or 
sag. 

“And the point is,” Smith went 
on, “that there’s nothing in the 
least remarkable about her. Prac- 
tically all elsies have bodies like 



that. Tell me, sir — what kind 
of female elsie would be desper- 
ate not to lose her man, so des- 
perate that she either instigated 
or agreed to a scheme like this 
to enable him to join her as an 
elsie?” 

“Of course!” Jo suddenly ex- 
claimed. “Elsies in general are 
physically twenty-five or less. An 
elsie who was older, who wasn’t 
wealthy, wouldn’t find men 
friends among elsies. She’d — ” 

“Very well,” said Zagreb. “I’m 
convinced. Let’s go.” 

T T elen Bauer received them 
-*■ -*■ with exactly the right mix- 
ture of startled innocence and 
annoyance at being suspected of 
such a thing. 

While Zagreb and Jo talked to 
her, however, Smith was looking 
around. It was no use looking for 
the knife, which could be lying 
openly among the rest of the 
cutlery. But Helen Bauer’s chal- 
et was tiny and bare; there were 
not many places where masks 
and the other materials neces- 
sary for successful disguise could 
be hidden. 

He found them under the 
boards of the bedroom. 

“It’s no use, Miss Bauer,” 
Zagreb said. 

“You can’t prove anything,” 
she said. “I have a mask that 
looks like the one the woman 
Sara Blair used. That’s all.”

“It’s by no means all,” Zagreb 
said grimly. “You amateur cri- 
minals haven’t a chance once we 
begin to suspect you. Analysis 
of your clothes, the dust in your 
hair, the patina of your skin 
and a host of other things will 
show us where you’ve been re- 
cently and what you’ve done. If 
the knife you used is still here, 
we’ll match it with Fax’s in- 
juries and that in itself will con- 
vict you. We’ll have your voice, 
modified by a throat resonator, 
checked against the Slessinger 
demand recording.” 

The woman saw she was beat- 
en. She shrugged. “You’ll never 
find out who worked with me,” 
she said. 

“I think we will. Miss Sey- 
mour, will you step outside for 
a moment?” 

Jo hesitated, then turned and 
went out. 

“Smith,” Zagreb said. “You 
hate elsies. You think they’re 
the scum of the earth.” 

Smith said nothing. 

“Here’s an elsie who won’t 
tell us the name of the man she 
worked with. She likes playing 
with knives. Have you a pocket 
knife, Smith?” 

“You’re not scaring me,” said 
Helen Bauer contemptuously. 
She was a hard woman. She 
had slashed two women and 
killed a man. “I’ll be executed 
anyway.” 



“No. You’ll be restored to nor- 
mal metabolism and kept in 
jail for life.” 

“Then I haven’t much to lose, 
have I?” 

“No,” Zagreb admitted. 
“You’ve nothing to lose. And yet 
I’m prepared to wager that you’ll 
do anything to stop Smith inflict- 
ing a minor cut on you. That’s 
why your scheme nearly work- 
ed, because all elsies are terri- 
fied of minor injury. Smith!” 
“You can’t do it. You’re cops 
aren’t you? You can’t — ” 

“Miss Bauer, all Smith is going 
to do is cut you somewhere. The 
location of the cut I leave to 
him. It’s such a small offense 
that—” 

“Small offense! The Elsie 
Council will — ” 

Zagreb had to laugh. “Miss 
Bauer, if you think that you of 
all people can count on the Elsie 
Council for anything whatever 
. but I’m sure you don’t. You 
were merely making a pleasant- 
ry. Well, Smith?” 

Smith was no sadist. But he 
took out his knife and opened it. 
Before the woman could move 
he seized her arm. As she watch- 
ed, fascinated, he drew the blade 
lightly across her forearm, so 
lightly that only the top skin 
was severed and no blood came. 
Two tiny red droplets showed. 

“Stop!” Helen Bauer scream- 
ed. She knew she was going to 



THE MAN WHO KILLED IMMORTALS 



137 



lose her elsie status anyway, but 
that was in the future and this 
was immediate. Something might 
happen at the trial; somehow she 
might get off. 

She couldn’t watch herself los- 
ing immortality. 

“I’ll tell you,” she said. 

4t'\7’ ou ’ re wrong, Smith,” Zag- 
* reb said gently. “It’s a 
great honor to be invited to meet 
the Elsie Council. Personally I 
wouldn’t miss it for worlds.” 
“I’m going to tell them,” 
Smith said, as they waited for 
the double doors to open, “that 
1 did my duty.” 

“But of course. By the way, 
do you know who the new Elsie 
Council president is?” 

“No. Should I?” 

The doors opened and they 
found themselves at one end of 
a long table at which twelve 
ordinary-looking men and wom- 
en sat. 

Smith saw only one face — 
that of Jo. She sat at the head 
of the table, smiling. 

“Please sit down,” she said. 
“Gentlemen, we asked you here 
to thank you. Of course you only 
did what you had to do in con- 
victing Robert Gilbert and Helen 
Bauer. But we’re grateful to you 
both, particularly to Sar Smith.” 
“When the Elsie Council has 
reason to be grateful to anyone, 
the usual thing is to offer them 

138 



the elsie treatment if they wish 
it. Unfortunately, Cap Zagreb, 
it’s unlikely in your case that 
the treatment would be success- 
ful.” 

“I’m well aware of that,” Zag- 
reb sighed. “Before you embar- 
rass me, Miss Seymour, let me 
make it clear that no reward of 
any kind is necessary or would 
be acceptable.” 

Jo nodded. “Then we’ll mere- 
ly thank you, Cap Zagreb. As 
for Sar Smith, the offer of the 
elsie treatment is open.” 

There was a pause, and then 
Jo went on: “Knowing you as I 
do, I suggest that you say noth- 
ing at all now, but think it over 
for, say, a week. No one knows 
better than we do that as well as 
advantages in being an elsie, 
there are disadvantages.” 

“There’s no need to think 
about it,” Smith said. He had 
gone white. He had been gen- 
uinely unprepared for this. 

And when it was made, when 
a man had a chance never to age, 
to project himself into the far 
future personally instead of vi- 
cariously through his children, 
perhaps by the side of girls like 
Jo Seymour, there was only one 
possible answer. 

“I accept,” he said, and did 
not turn his head or even blush 
when, beside him, Zagreb began 
to laugh uncontrollably.

HARRY PROTAGONIST 




BY RiCHARD WILSON 



Everybody on Earth was with 
the astronauts on their Mars 
trip — not only in spiritl 



T Tarry Protagonist, space-age 
entrepreneur, had been plan- 
ning the project since the Gus 
Grissom shot. 

The idea was splendidly sim- 
ple — to let everyone in the 
United States participate per- 
sonally when the first Americans 
landed on Mars. 

Harry Protagonist promised 
something special. Not the vicar- 
ious sort of participation people 
had when they listened to delay- 
ed recordings of an astronaut 
telling about fireflies in space, 
or watched a mock-up clock 



ticking off the minutes since 
blastoff. 

Harry promised full audience 
participation ... a living link 
between the space pioneers and 
those lucky enough to have join- 
ed his You, Astronaut Club. 

What Harry was selling was 
an intimate connection with the 
mind of one of the four astro- 
nauts participating in Project 
Long Leap. He offered utter 
identification with one of the 
first people to set foot on Mars. 

This, historically comparable 
to the first footfall by Colum- 



139 



bus in the western hemisphere, 
would cost a mere ten bucks — 
$8.75 on the pre-payment plan 
to those who sent their checks at 
once, saving billing fees. 

Harry, a former senior editor 
at Life Magazine, knew which 
executive he had to deal with at 
the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration to get ex- 
clusive brain rights to the astro- 
nauts. 

It cost Harry a mere $50 mil- 
lion, payable on the launching 
of the four-man spaceship. 

'T'he four Marsbound astro- 
A nauts were George Lincoln, 
John F. Adams, Dwight D. 
Roosevelt and Thomas Alva 
Wright. 

By an amazing coincidence, 
ethnicswise, the four were a 
Protestant, a Catholic, a Jew and 
a Moslem who was also a Negro 

Thus they were 100% true- 
blue Americans. 

Each had an I.Q. no lower 
than 130 and no higher than 146 
(the NASA director’s I.Q. was 
147 ). 

Each of the astronauts knew 
he might never return, but each 
also knew that if he did he would 
be a hero — and a rich hero. 
His many pre-launch contracts, 
with Harry Protagonist and oth- 
ers, guaranteed him a fortune be- 
fore his 30th birthday. 

Thus, for a fee of $10,000 pay- 



able on his return to Earth, each 
astronaut let himself be fitted 
with a sensor which connected 
his thoughts not only to NASA’s 
electronic ear but also to Harry 
Protagonist’s giant empathy in- 
stallation at the You, Astronaut 
Club. 

Virtually all Americans were 
hooked up to the Marsbound 
hero astronauts. 

This was because Harry Pro- 
tagonist had generously okayed 
a special rate of $1 per kid for 
schools, so that every child in 
every school that had electricity 
was connected, brainwise, to the 
Intrepid Four. 

Everybody got his choice of 
an astronaut, even the dollar- 
apiece kids. 

This meant that when he paid 
his buck or his ten bucks he 
picked one of the four astronauts 
for his very own to share history 
with. 

Harry Protagonist guaranteed 
everybody that what the astro- 
naut saw, felt and thought, he 
would see, feel and think, from 
liftoff on Earth to landfall on 
Mars. 

You can see what’s coming, 
can’t you? 

I will tell you anyway; it will 
appeal to your sense of irony. 

What happened was that the 
Martians pranged the astronauts 
as they were coming in for a 
landing. 



140 



GALAXY 



They (the Martians) got them 
(the astronauts) in their sights 
and clobbered them like sitting 
ducks. 

It was too bad but, as the 
British would put it (and later 
did), there it was. 

Nobody had figured on there 
being Martians, let alone bad 
Martians. 

I n the ordinary course of things 
we’d have lost only four as- 
tronauts. 

But because of Harry Protag- 
onist’s grand scheme, one hun- 
dred and seventy-four million, 
three hundred and sixty-two 
thousand, five hundred and 
eighty-nine people who had been 
hooked up, mindwise, to the four 
astronauts also perished. 

It was a real brain drain. 
Fortunately for Harry Protag- 
onist, all of the 170 million-odd 



had paid in advance; and he 
himself, instinctively distrustful 
of his own schemes, hadn’t been 
hooked up to any of the astro- 
nauts. 

He became a rather sad and 
lonely billionaire — but not for 
long. 

The overpopulated British, at- 
tracted by the American vac- 
uum, came down by way of Can- 
ada to take over the country 
and applied their confiscatory 
taxes to the Queen’s new subject, 
Harry Protagonist. 

The British explained that 
they had acted in the highest 
tradition of the Anglo-American 
Alliance and from the purest mo- 
tive possible, to keep the Rus- 
sians out. 

There wasn’t anything any- 
body was able to do about it; 
I mean there it was.

FIN’S FUNERAL 

BY DONALD H. MENZEL

fin Nolan was undoubtedly 
dead. But what was it that 
was living on — eternally? 



OO 



returned late that afternoon 
to find the phone ringing im- 
peratively. I answered it, dashed 
out again, hailed a passing taxi 
and settled back to scan the 
paper I had picked up on the 
way. There was the story on 
page one, a few lines concerning 
my closest friend and former 
teacher: 



Late News Bulletin 
Los Angeles, April 25. Frederick I. 
“Fin” Nolan, the world-famous scientist, 
died here today as a result of a heart 
attack at the age of 68. His studies of 
space and time, extensions of Einstein's 
theories, won him international recog- 
nition as a mathematical physicist. Dur- 
ing World War II he made significant 
contributions to both the chemical and 
physical aspects of the famed Manhattan 
Project which produced the first atomic 
bomb. 



Nolan had been in practical retire- 
ment for several years, because of poor 
health. His nearest living relative is a 
niece, Harriet E. Nolan, of Santa Monica. 

I was shocked, of course — 
shocked but not surprised. After 
his first heart attack two years 
ago, Fin should have taken it 
easier. If anything, he had ac- 
celerated his pace, working long 
hours in his private laboratory. 
As a former student, I was Fin’s 
closest friend and confidant. He 
tried out his theories on me and 
we worked as a team in the ex- 
perimental laboratory, mixing 
chemicals, assembling electronic 
devices, and so on. Exciting, fas- 
cinating ! 

Most people assumed that 



142 



Fin’s nickname derived from his 
initials. I knew of two more com- 
pelling reasons. He had not ac- 
quired the “handle” until col- 
lege where his exceptional talent 
for science and mathematics be- 
came evident. The concept of in- 
finity, especially from the stand- 
point of space and time, fasci- 
nated him. He was always so 
ready to discuss his favorite topic 
that his associates took to calling 
him “Infinity,” which time and 
familiarity shortened to “Fin.” 

And Fin Nolan’s right cheek 
bore a livid birthmark in the 
shape of a figure eight lying on 
its side: the mathematician’s 

symbol for infinity. I have said 
“birthmark,” but I remember 
Fin’s telling me that the disfigur- 
ing symbol had not appeared un- 
til he was about two years old. 
He was rather proud of it. To 
him it was more a trademark 
than a birthmark. 

Fin Nolan was an out-and- 
out-genius. His knowledge in the 
sciences — physics, mathematics, 
astronomy, chemistry — was 
prodigious. He possessed, in ad- 
dition, an inventive streak, which 
enabled him to turn nature’s 
laws to practical use. He was 
something of an engineer and 
royalties from several of his in- 
ventions had made him wealthy. 
Perhaps the most successful of 
these was a highly accurate 
atomic wristwatch, whose lumi- 



nous dial provided motive power 
for the hands. 

His greatest interest — call it 
a hobby if you will — was in 
the geometry of the universe: the 
fundamental meaning of space 
and time. On these subjects he 
read everything that came to 
hand, from Einstein to Ray Brad- 
bury. Rockets, missiles, satel- 
lites, space travel interested him 
equally. 

jV [fy mind flashed back to a 
recent conversation. “You 
know, Dave,” Fin had said, 
“Einstein’s theory of relativity 
is based on a hypothesis that 
time is a fourth dimension. Time, 
therefore, should be on a par 
with space in the universe. And 
yet there is a singular differ- 
ence, arising from the fact that 
space has three dimensions, 
where time has only one. You 
can turn an object upside down 
in space but you can’t reverse it 
in time. In outer space there is 
no unique direction, such as up 
or down. But there is in time. 
Time is always a one-way 
stretch, a single track leading 
forward into the future or back- 
ward into the past. But, in the 
purely geometric sense, how can 
you say which direction of time 
is the past and which the fu- 
ture?” 

“Surely that’s no problem,” I 
argued. “I always associate time 



FIN'S FUNERAL 



143 



with motion — rotation of the 
earth or revolution of the plan- 
ets around the sun.” 

‘‘That’s exactly what I mean, 
Dave.” Fin said. “Just suppose 
that you are a man from some 
planet revolving around the star 
Sirius and that you’ve never seen 
the solar system. Now, if I were 
to present you with a motion- 
picture film showing the planets 
whirling around the sun, you’d 
have no way of figuring out how 
to put it into the projector. The 
film would make just as much 
sense backwards as forwards. 
None of the basic laws of physics 
and astronomy would be 
changed. So that you, as a Sirian, 
couldn’t tell from the film which 
is the past and which the fu- 
ture.” 

“But,” I argued, “suppose the 
film should show meteors plung- 
ing into the earth’s atmosphere 
and burning up. Surely I could 
tell then. A backwards film, 
showing a train of fire shooting 
out into space and condensing in- 
to a solid meteor, would make no 
sense at all.” 

“I agree, of course,” Fin ad- 
mitted. “The only processes in- 
dicating the direction of what 
Eddington once termed ‘Time’s 
Arrow’ are those associated with 
heat or friction. A bucket of hot 
water, in cooler surroundings, 
always cools down. It never gets 
hotter of its own accord. 



“But what I really meant was 
that time should be associated 
with the universe itself — not 
based upon the microscopic pro- 
cesses that govern friction and 
heat. Otherwise time would be 
very different from space, which 
exists independently of the mat- 
ter it contains. 

“Or does it?” Fin mused aloud. 
“You’re familiar of course with 
the theory known as Continuous 
Creation of Matter — invented 
by Gold, Hoyle and Bondi?” 

I nodded agreement, and Fin 
continued. “The expanding uni- 
verse is a fact — not a theory. 
It is well established by obser- 
vation. Gold and his colleagues 
argue that, as space expands, 
matter must continually and au- 
tomatically be created in it, so 
that the universe won’t thin out. 

“Now let me ask you a simple 
question. Why does a balloon 
expand?” 

“It expands because you blow 
into it,” I answered. 

“Exactly! Gold, Hoyle and 
Bondi are right except that they 
have their theory hindside to. 
They’ve confused cause and ef- 
fect. I think that the universe 
is expanding because matter is 
being created within it. And this 
new matter pushes out the 
boundaries of space with a speed 
approaching that of light. 

“It seems to me that the rea- 
soning of Gold and company is 



144 



GALAXY 



a modern version of the discredit- 
ed idea of the ancients that na- 
ture abhors a vacuum — which 
of course is absolute nonsense. I 
don’t see how a vacuum could 
suck matter into existence. How- 
ever, a positive pressure from the 
new atoms could push out the 
boundaries of space. 

“My idea now clearly defines 
the progression of time. Time 
advances as the universe ex- 
pands. More than that! I con- 
clude that one could in some way 
cause matter to disappear ‘un- 
created’ — we could reverse 
time.” 

i i r r'hat doesn’t sound reason- 
able to me,” I objected. 
“Surely there’s no way of turning 
time backward.” 

“Maybe not in the Universe as 
a whole,” Fin agreed. “But if 
we could uncreate matter in a 
limited region, time would re- 
verse there perhaps balanced 
by excess creation of matter in 
the regions immediately sur- 
rounding, where time would pro- 
gress more rapidly than else- 
where in the universe.” 

“Isn’t the atomic bomb uncrea- 
tion of matter?” I asked. 

“Certainly not! In the bomb, 
matter is merely transformed in- 
to energy. The total mass is iden- 
tical since matter and energy 
are equivalent to one another. 
“This concept of mine suggests 



that matter breeds matter, so to 
speak. I visualize that the whole 
universe — some ten billion years 
ago — consisted of only one or, 
more probably, two atoms con- 
tained in a tiny sphere about the 
size of a toy balloon. Suddenly 
matter began to appear inside 
and the balloon started its ex- 
pansion which has gone on steadi- 
ly ever since. The entire universe 
is the offspring of those two ori- 
ginal atoms.” 

“The original Atom and Eve?” 
I queried. Fin’s pained face in- 
dicated his disapproval of my oc- 
casional compulsion to turn the 
apt pun. So I continued on a 
more scientific plane. 

“Do you mean that the sun 
and the earth are gradually grow- 
ing bigger because of atoms 
created in them?” I asked. 

“There are two opposite 
schools of thought,” he replied. 
“Gold thinks that the new mat- 
ter is spread uniformly through 
all of space. And then, to get it 
back into the stars where it could 
serve as a fuel and prolong their 
lives, he imagines that the stars 
capture it, the matter raining 
down to the surface. On this 
hypothesis not much matter 
forms in any one place. As Hoyle 
expresses it, in a single year only 
one atom is created in a volume 
about the size of a large sky- 
scraper. 

“I’ve already expressed my 

145 



FIN'S FUNERAL 



view. Matter breeds matter. I 
think that the creation occurs 
wherever matter is already dense. 
So that everything is actually 
putting on weight.” 

“How much?” I asked. “Can 
I blame my increasing avoir- 
dupois on this?” 

“Hardly,” Fin replied. “The 
earth is gaining about a billion 
atoms per cubic inch every sec- 
ond.” 

“Sounds like a lot to me,” I 
continued. 

“You’ve forgotten how light 
atoms actually are. At that rate 
it would take you about a million 
years to put on a single pound. 
This means that no test known 
to man could possibly decide be- 
tween these two extremes, wheth- 
er the created matter is uniform- 
ly distributed through space or 
concentrated in the denser re- 
gions like stars and planets.” 

Qeveral months later Fin indi- 
M cated to me that he had not 
considered our talk mere fancy. 
We were in his laboratory, in- 
specting one of his latest experi- 
ments, employing equipment that 
looked like a miniature electric 
power station: wires, insulators, 
transistors, surrounding a large 
metal tube about three feet on 
each side. 

“Solid uranium,” he said, “ex- 
cept for a small hollow about 
six inches across at its center.” 



“Pure uranium 238?” I asked, 
somewhat awed by the amount 
of the metal and its great value. 

“Obviously,” Fin replied. “This 
mass is far above the critical 
mass for U-235. Only a fraction 
of that amount of U-235 and we 
would be mere atoms floating in 
the mushroom cloud of an after- 
explosion!” 

“But U-238 has a very low 
level of radioactivity,” I observ- 
ed. “Why not use a cyclotron or 
an atomic pile?” 

“I’m using this uranium be- 
cause of its high density, not as 
a source of radioactivity,” he ex- 
plained quietly. “Since this is 
one of the dense elements, crea- 
tion of matter within this mass 
will be greater than any other 
place on earth, if my theory is 
correct.” 

The simple statement was 
startling in its implications. 

“The central chamber con- 
tains coils of electrons capable 
of producing the most powerful 
electromagnetic fields in the 
world,” Fin had said. “Now 
watch.” 

He pressed a switch and a mo- 
tor generator began to whine. 
The laboratory lights dimmed. 
Without warning, the tubes be- 
gan to glow. A sudden crack, 
like the sound of a thousand jet 
planes simultaneously breaking 
the sound barrier, almost broke 
my eardrums. Then silence, as 



146 



GALAXY 



the lights returned to normal 
brilliance. 

“Considerable hydrogen fusion 
in the chamber,” Fin explained. 
“Something like a miniature H- 
bomb. But still not enough for a 
sustained reaction. However, that 
isn’t the real reason behind this 
experiment.” 

Opening a door in the cube, he 
withdrew a small filmholder. We 
developed it together in the dark- 
room. A few minutes later we 
were studying the result. 

“This is a spectrogram of hy- 
drogen, excited in the electro- 
magnetic field of the chamber. 
Don’t pay any attention to the 
broader line at the center. That’s 
caused by ordinary Stark or Zee- 
man effects. But look at the pe- 
culiar appearance at the edges.” 

I could see the normal straight 
line curled like hooks. “Why,” 
I gasped, “the wavelengths are 
all shifted. The beta line is 
orange-yellow instead of blue- 
green. All the lines are shifted 
to the left!” 

“Yes,” Fin agreed. “The red 
shift, like that shown in light 
from nebulae in distant parts of 
the universe where time pro- 
ceeds more slowly than it does 
here. Dave, I feel that I’m on 
the verge of the greatest dis- 
covery of my life. In these intense 
electromagnetic fields I am slow- 
ing time down by inhibiting the 
creation of matter!” 



That conversation took place 
three months ago, and I had not 
seen Fin since. Consolidated had 
sent me to Cape Kennedy to help 
study some problems of their 
new intercontinental ballistic 
missile. 

And now I should never know 
the answer. 

nphe arrival of the taxi at the 
-*■ E and C Building recalled 
my mind from the past. I went 
up to the office of Mr. Dines, 
Fin’s personal lawyer. Mr. Dines 
himself greeted me. “We’ve been 
trying to reach you all after- 
noon, Mr. Desmond,” he said. 
“Sorry to bring you such bad 
news. I know how close you were 
to Mr Nolan. But this matter is 
very urgent.” 

He ushered me into his office. 

“I assume you know Miss Har- 
riet Nolan,” he remarked, inclin- 
ing his head toward the thin 
woman who wore a grayish bun 
at the nape of her neck. 

Of course I knew Harriet, the 
unmarried daughter of Fin’s 
brother. Funny how I always 
thought of her as old, though she 
was only 40 or so. Our paths had 
crossed many times, but I took 
no pleasure from recalling those 
meetings. Harriet approved nei- 
ther of me nor of her Uncle Fin 
— or, rather, her Uncle Freder- 
ick, for she had taken an aver- 
sion to his nickname.

She gave me a cold, tight- 
lipped smile t llG t acknowledged 
my presence and said, with ob- 
vious irritation, “Where have you 
been, David? We’ve been waiting 
more than five hours!” 

“Sorry,” I apologized. “But I 
had no way of knowing. Spent 
the afternoon in conference. Con- 
fidential work. That’s all I can 
say, of course. My sincere con- 
dolences about Fin.” 

“Now that Uncle Frederick is 
gone,” she remonstrated, “I hope 
you will drop that horrible nick- 
name. Why do parents give their 
children names whose initials can 
be so easily corrupted!” 

Harriet’s middle name was 
Edna, I knew. Perhaps her dis- 
like of “Fin” stemmed from fear 
that people might dub her “Hen”, 
as indeed some of us did, behind 
her back. 

Mr. Dines cleared his throat 
and, indicating a chair for me, 
broke up our exchange. “This 
shouldn’t take long,” he said. 
“First the will and then certain 
instructions about the funeral.” 
He unfolded a paper and read. 
The will was simple enough. 

I, Frederick I. Nolan, being of sound 
and disposing mind, declare this to be 
my last will and testament, revoking all 
previous wills made by me. 

I direct that my funeral expenses and 
all debts be paid promptly. 

To my niece, Harriet E. Nolan, of 
Santa Monica, California, I bequeath the 
sum of $25,000. 



The residue of my estate, I give, de- 
vise, and bequeath to my esteemed friend 
and associate, David Desmond. 

I nominate David Desmond to be the 
executor of this my will to serve with- 
out bond and with full authority to sell 
or otherwise dispose of my property as 
he may desire. A confidential letter, 
attached hereto, and addressed to David 
Desmond, gives further directions con- 
cerning my funeral and burial. 

As the attorney concluded, an 
explosive gasp called my atten- 
tion to Harriet. Her cheeks were 
pink and her pursed lips blue 
with anger. “Of all the nerve!” 
she sputtered. “It’s an outright 
insult! I knew his mind was fail- 
ing these last few years. Of 
course I’ll break the will.” 

“The will is five years old and 
properly signed and witnessed,” 
Dines advised. 

“Let’s see what’s in the letter 
then,” Harriet interjected. “That 
might clear up the matter.” 
“The letter’s addressed to 
David Desmond,” Dines observ- 
ed pointedly. Speaking directly 
to me, he advised, “You have no 
obligation whatever to disclose its 
contents to anyone. Even I 
don’t know its provisions.” 

“Oh, go ahead and read it,” I 
conceded. “After all, Harriet is 
his closest relative and will have 
to know about the funeral ar- 
rangements.” 

TT'he lawyer inspected the red 
-*■ wax seal, slit the envelope, 
and unfolded the contents.

“Perhaps I should tell you,” 
he said, “that Mr. Nolan replac- 
ed an earlier letter with this new 
one just last week.” He then 
went on to read. 

Dear Dave: 

i have full confidence that you will 
carry out my wishes to the letter, how- 
ever bizarre some of them may seem 
to you. 

My funeral is to be private, attended 
only by vourself and Harriet, should she 
wish to come. I made the basic arrange- 
ments long ago. 

The casket, one that I designed per- 
sonally, is in storage at Lane’s Mortuary. 
You will insist that no one is to make 
any adjustments whatever of the various 
dials on the exterior. 

There are to be no formal services. 
The casket containing my body should 
be placed in the family burial vault at 
Evergreen Cemetery. 

On the side of the casket you will 
find a large silver button. When the 
casket is finally set in place, you are 
to push that button and then leave 
immediately. 

The lawyer turned the page 
and hesitated. “Miss Nolan,” he 
said, “I’m afraid the next para- 
graph wasn’t intended for you. 
I think that we’d all be happier if 
we stopped right here.” 

“Not at all!” Harriet exclaim- 
ed. “I’ve got to know the rest, 
now.” 

“Okay, then. But remember I 
warned you.” He hurried on, 
reading rapidly until the end. 



You probably will have some trouble 
with Hen, who has never liked either 
of us. She hasn't the slightest apprecia- 
tion of science. So be careful in your 



dealings with her. I rely entirely on 
your judgment should any unexpected 
emergency arise. 

Sincerely yours, 

Fin 

The explosion next to me came 
within a few tons TNT of equal- 
ing that of the bomb at Hiroshi- 
ma. 

“Of all the insults! Of all the 
idiots! First of all a mere $25,000 
from an estate that must be 
worth at least a million ! And now 
this — ” She fumed on. Had it 
been out of doors, I’m sure that 
a mushroom cloud would have 
been clearly visible overhead. 

The attorney quickly inter- 
vened. “Probably between $800,- 
000 and $900,000, but subject to 
heavy taxes before distribution.” 
He coughed and spoke apolo- 
getically to me. “This is really 
your responsibility, I know. How- 
ever, you can’t keep figures like 
that under cover for long.” 
“But,” I asked Harriet, “I un- 
derstood that you were quite 
wealthy in your own right? After 
all, your mother . 

“That isn’t it,” she returned. 
“Frankly, I feel I have as much 
right as you do to Uncle Freder- 
ick’s estate. Especially since his 
latest actions have been so pe- 
culiar.” 

I bristled. “Peculiar? In my 
entire life I have never thought 
Fin peculiar in any respect.” 
She overlooked my use of the 



FIN'S FUNERAL 



149 



nickname. “Peculiar is right! Al- 
ways taking about explosions. 
Explosions in time and space!” 

I suppose that some of Fin’s 
explanations would have been 
unintelligible to a non-scientist. 
And I could recall his exact 
words. “Explosions,” he had said, 
“are events primarily of space 
rather than of time. An atomic 
bomb detonates. The explosion 
develops into a shock wave that 
has a devastating effect on space, 
but none at all upon time. But — 
you get a strong enough force 
field and I think you might 
change time as well as space.” 
That discussion, which Harriet 
also had heard, antedated ours 
about time and expanding uni- 
verse. I suppose it would have 
been frightening to a layman — 
and a woman at that. 

A nd that is how I, on a rainy 
April afternoon, came to be 
in a darkened vault in Evergreen 
Cemetery. Dust-covered stone 
slabs concealed several coffins. A 
few urns, standing in niches on 
the vails, undoubtedly contained 
the ashes of other relatives. 

By comparison, Fin’s casket, 
even in the gray light, was start- 
ling to behold. It had the appear- 
ance of burnished silver, though 
I didn’t know what the metal 
was. It was certainly not uran- 
ium, though I thought how sin- 
gularly appropriate that metal 



would have been. Most startling 
of all were several dials on the 
side, which gave to it the ap- 
pearance of a huge radio set. I 
recalled Fin’s admonition about 
the dials and had carefully 
warned the Mortuary about this 
detail. And I readily recognized 
the silver button ready for me to 
push. 

The casket was open, as I had 
directed. I took a last look at 
Fin. He looked very natural, even 
to the infinity-symbol mark on 
his cheek. 

Numerous floral tributes had 
arrived despite the printed re- 
quest, “Please omit flowers.” I 
felt sure that Fin himself would 
have approved my arrangement 
of them to form the doubled 
circle of infinity. 

The screeching of a rusty hinge 
interrupted my thoughts, and a 
shadow fell on the casket. I 
turned to face Harriet. 

“I decided to come after all,” 
she announced, stepping toward 
Fin and allowing her hands to 
rest lightly on the casket. “Poor 
Uncle Frederick. What nonsense 
about these dials!” Suddenly, be- 
fore I could intervene, she gave 
one of them a vicious turn. 

“Stop!” I cried — too late. “You 
mustn’t move them!” I tried to 
reset the dial, but the resetting 
was only approximate of course. 
In accord with the directions I 
pushed down the lid, which 



150 



GALAXY 



clicked into place. I then pressed 
the silver button, and stepped 
back. “We must leave immed- 
iately,” I advised, walking rapid- 
ly toward the door of the vault. 

A low humming noise, like the 
buzzing of a swarm of bees, came 
from the casket. The sound grew 
louder until it seemed a pulsing 
roar. By this time I was fright- 
ened. “Hurry!” I yelled to Har- 
riet. But it was already too late. 
A greenish glow, emanating from 
the casket, suffused the scene, 
casting weird reddish shadows 
against the wall. Then came a 
deafening explosion. The blast 
threw me violently to the floor 
and I blacked out from the con- 
cussion. 

When I recovered my senses, 
darkness had come. I stumbled 
to my feet, groped in my pocket 
for a flashlight and pushed the 
button. The beam revealed the 
casket twisted and torn open — 
and mysteriously empty. 

All this I saw in a glance as I 
knelt over Harriet. She was alive 
though her pulse was feeble and 
fluttering. But I had the great- 
est shock when I turned the light 
on her face. Her cheeks were 
shrunken and wrinkled, her hair 
— still in a prissy bun— white. 
Were it not for the identifying 
dress she wore, I would never 
have recognized this obviously 
aged creature as Harriet. 

In semi-panic I lifted her over 



my shoulder and stumbled to- 
ward the door. Stumbled indeed! 
In the darkness my foot struck a 
soft object. A bundle of clothes, 
I thought, until a piercing cry 
from it made me realize that the 
bundle contained something 
alive. 

Quickly I carried Harriet to my 
parked car, dropped her on the 
rear seat and ran back breath- 
lessly to the tomb. The “bundle” 
proved to contain a child, about 
a year old as nearly as I could 
judge. I took the baby to the car 
and drove to the gate, which a 
suspicious watchman finally 
opened. From there I dashed to 
the hospital. 

\T early a year has elapsed since 

^ then. During this interval, 
my conviction has grown that the 
casket was a time machine, op- 
erating on principle of uncreating 
matter. Fin had undoubtedly pre- 
set dials with the intention of 
bringing himself back to the 
prime of his life. 

But Harriet’s contemptuous 
turning of the dial had upset the 
delicate adjustment. Outside the 
casket time had jumped ahead, 
causing Harriet to age some 
thirty years in the same time 
transition whose greater intensity 
and reversed sign within the cas- 
ket and had carried Fin sixty- 
seven years into the past. 

Harriet survived. The doctors 

151 



FIN'S FUNERAL 



attributed her sudden aging to 
some unusual and unknown dis- 
ease — an explanation which she 
herself accepted. She was, after 
all, somewhat hazy about the 
passage of time, though by no 
means senile. She remembered 
Fin’s death but had no recollec- 
tion of what had happened. 

She swallowed her pride 
enough to solicit my help in her 
business affairs — probably be- 
cause she had no one else to turn 
to. But she resented the child, 
whom I had managed to adopt 
and had given the name of Fred- 
erick I. Nolan Desmond. The re- 
cords indicate that he was a door- 
step baby but the location of the 
doorstep that I found him on is 
not mentioned. 



At our last meeting, Hen voiced 
her feelings. “Why do you insist 
on calling that child Fin? You 
know how I dislike that nick- 
name.” And then she continued 
as if talking to herself, “He cer- 
tainly does resemble Uncle Fred- 
erick’s baby pictures.” She care- 
fully scrutinized the boy who was 
adeptly arranging blocks on the 
carpet. Suddenly she gave a 
choking cry. Pointing at little 
Fin, she exclaimed, “I never saw 
that before!” 

I looked myself. There on the 
child’s right cheek I saw for the 
first time the shadowy markings 
of a figure eight lying on its side, 
the mathematician’s symbol for 
infinity.

T)ook reviewing, like writing, 
editing or driving a nitro- 
glycerine truck, is one of those 
occupations for which no one 
feels need of much previous 
training. So it must also turn out 
to be one of those occupations as 
full of ground rules as a Zen tea 
ceremonial and as little suscep- 
tible to perfect success. 

In this unsettling view of the 
matter, the only promising way 
for the beginner is with the re- 
solve to keep things direct and 
simple. Accordingly, I here pro- 
pose to read books, consider what 
I imagine their authors to have 
been doing, and discuss what I 
find interesting in some of them. 
This is about all I propose to 
do. If I then turn out to have 
been doing more, the consequent 
dismay will be mutual. 

r T''he salient thing about Poul 
Anderson at this moment is 
that we will all soon realize he 



has for some time been science 
fiction’s best storyteller. In part, 
this is because he rarely lets a 
story go by without conveying a 
sense that he had to learn some- 
thing new in order to write it. 
Learning something new seems 
to be important to him, and he 
has now been at it for some fif- 
teen years and over a span of 
hundreds of stories of various 
lengths ranging over scores of 
various kinds. 

Doubleday has recently pub- 
lished two collections, Trader to 
The Stars ($3.50) and Time and 
Stars ($3.95), which, while they 
do not prove these assertions, do 
suggest them. The former book 
is a package of three novelettes 
about Nicholas Van Rijn, the 
boorish slob who makes unblush- 
ing use of his naked power, wal- 
lows in the sensual luxuries at- 
tendant on his commercial suc- 
cess and thus makes a splendid 
pulp hero. Time and Stars is a 



153 



more broad collection of six less 
clangorous stories, including a 
beautifully done piece of work 
like nothing I have seen in the 
field before. 

Van Rijn, endowed with sur- 
prising agility in so bulky a man, 
is loveable and not especially un- 
believable in “Hiding Place” and 
“Territory,” the first two stories 
in Trader to The Stars. He was 
the same in his novel, The Man 
Who Counts, where if you re- 
call he solved one major prob- 
lem by biting the finger of 
the alien villain, who was of 
course totally helpess to with- 
stand the virulent poisons in 
earthly saliva. Ingenious, ingrat- 
iating, and heartwarming though 
this kind of writing is, it is not 
going to suit Anderson for long 
stretches at a time, it never has 
in the past. And I believe this is 
why, though “Hiding Place” is a 
neat puzzle-find the intelligent 
aliens hiding among their exotic 
specimens on the captured alien 
zoo-ship — and “Territory” is the 
story in which Little Blasphem- 
ous Sambo sets the tigers run- 
ning around his tree so fast they 
melt themselves into an excel- 
lent grade of commercial butter 
— “The Master Key” is some- 
thing else again. It is the story of 
adventure told from arm-chairs 
at the London military club by 
the chapfallen young Indian 
Army officer who fears he has 



let the side down. The Sir 
Aubrey Smith part is played by 
Van Rijn; the flashback battle 
scenes all star Errol Flynn as the 
subaltern, with a part written in 
for Tyrone Power as the Captain 
From Castile. Van Rijn blusters 
and starts his way through this 
audition; the mannerisms that 
seem possible in a silk-shirted 
bounder from pillow to purse do 
not sit well on a bulwark of Em- 
pire. For long moments, it is al- 
most as if we were being asked to 
believe there is some ultimate 
social good in Van Rijn’s per- 
sonal avarice, a hypothesis true 
in the abstract but thoroughly 
undermined here by the hero’s 
broad winks into the wings dur- 
ing the first two acts. 

But please note the complaint 
is with the inconsistency, not 
with the integrity of the incon- 
sistent piece. For what “The 
Master Key” is, it is well-enough 
done. It should not have been 
shaped for inclusion in the Van 
Rijn canon, but that is probably 
a fault of Anderson’s being able 
to write in so many different 
ways, and being impatient to 
write them. With that kind of 
fault, a man needs fewer virtues. 

What Anderson needed in 
Time and Stars was an editor. 
“Eve Times Four,” the last piece 
in the book, is an anticlimactic, 
out-of-focus inversion of the old 
Planet Stories castaways-of-the- 



154 



GALAXY 



starlanes plot. The reverse-hero 
is ugly, not bumptious, and the 
superficially levelheaded heroine 
marooned with him may have 
been well within her logic but 
was obviously reasoning straight 
from her chastity belt all the 
same. See “Territory,” where 
much the same young lady dan- 
ces the same dance, but to Van 
Rijn’s tune. 

The second least successful 
story in Time and Stars is the 
lead. “No Truce With Kings,” 
a-flicker with confusing scene- 
changes, stuffed with narrative 
compressions and a pale army of 
sketched characters, should have 
been tried as a novel (Heinlein’s 
Sixth Column in reverse, with 
less unity but more breadth and 
depth, and I think better char- 
acterization.) 

But between these two stories, 
which serve to provide an exas- 
perating beginning and a flat 
ending to a four-dollar book, lies 
more than your money’s worth. 
“Turning Point” is distinguished 
by its simple charm; a reasonably 
good what-if idea (What if we 
do run into aliens who are so 
likeable and so superior that we 
will just give up and sit down to 
applaud?) told with inventive- 
ness for detail and fond charac- 
terization, and embodying a like- 
ly proposal for solving this pos- 
sible real problem. This is fol- 
lowed by “Escape From Orbit,” 



which I’ll get back to. That is 
followed by “Epilogue,” an un- 
falteringly sustained creation 
reminiscent of Don A. Stuart’s 
“Night” crossed with whatever 
you think is the best Hal Clem- 
ent story; a story about an Earth 
so far removed in time and cir- 
cumstances from our own that 
the contemporary humans who 
intrude on it seem monstrous, 
while the Earth-denizens of that 
day seem right and proper mas- 
ters of the house they have built 
on what Man abandoned. And 
“The Critique of Impure Rea- 
son,” while mostly a writer’s 
story, about a future society in 
which the “little magazine” and 
the kind of creativity it engenders 
have taken over publishing, is 
going to be pleasant reading for 
science-fiction fans as well. 

What may turn out to be high- 
1 y memorable reading for 
science-fiction fans is the story 
I put by above. “Escape From 
Orbit” is a technique-problem 
story; the consulting expert is 
called in to resolve the emer- 
gency in space, where three men 
are trapped and doomed to die 
unless he can, by exercising tech- 
nical ingenuity in an office on 
Earth’s surface, so arrange the 
available materials and data as 
to bring them safely down. 

As we all know, this story 
when well done affirms many 
ideals for us. It is done very well 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF

lere. But it isn’t the real story. 
•Vhat Anderson has really been 
doing with this structure is 
brought forward and recapitulat- 
ed at the end, when the exhaust- 
ed hero, his dealings with the 
inflexible Universe satisfactorily 
concluded, now has to go home 
and get his kid off to school. The 
wife who has been phoning him 
for help with her routine house- 
hold problems while he was fig- 
uring orbits has been so drained 
by her difficulties that she has 
slept through the ringing of the 
alarm clock. 

Anderson’s technical execution 
of this story is superb. The most 
important of the many subtle ob- 
jectives he set out to reach — and 
he reached every one I could de- 
tect at all — was to make this a 
profoundly optimistic and en- 
nobling story. He has at least 
added a new dimension to what 
seemed to be a completely 
rounded science-fiction form. I 
actually believe he has wiped it 
out and substituted something 
much more genuinely satisfying 
and truer to life, but that re- 
mains to be seen. 

One thing that impresses me 
most distinctly is that Anderson 
shows the hero manipulating the 
supposedly difficult problem by 
wireless, but having to fend off 
the wife’s problems with stop- 
gaps and finally having to go 
home in person, not to solve but 



merely to alleviate one specify 
among them. I doubt very much 
whether this story was intended 
to be merely about one man and 
one wife, or cabbages or kings; 
I believe it was intended to be 
about whatever energy-sink each 
of us has; we all have them — so 
do our wives, kids and kings. I 
think one thing you could say 
about this story, if you had only 
one thing to say, would be that it 
is about where entropy really 
lives. And I think it is a piece of 
literature that could only have 
been written by a man thorough- 
ly steeped in the traditions of 
science fiction, and which conse- 
quently could not possibly be 
fully understood by the editors 
or readers of “mainstream” an- 
thologies of noteworthy contem- 
porary writing, which is one of 
the places where this piece of 
work otherwise belongs. 

Their loss is a consequence of 
our gain, and much comfort may 
that give a man whose tireless 
polishing of his talents has put 
him in that paradox. Whether 
this story is the clear and out- 
standing contribution to the field 
that I presently believe it to be, 
I may have occasion to report at 
some time when my blood has 
cooled and my omniscience is 
not impaired by admiration. I 
do believe that “Escape From 
Orbit” creates a doubt that there 
have been very many genuinely 



156

realistic science-fiction stories. It 
certainly makes a mockery of the 
kind of realism based on con- 
scientiously counting the number 
of Johns aboard the spaceship. 

T> lr ' eith Laumer’s The Great 
* Time Machine Hoax (Simon 
& Schuster, $3.95) is billed as a 
picaresque jape about Chester W. 
Chester IV, swept back and per- 
haps forth through time by his 
idiosyncratic great-grandfather’s 
equally eccentric, omnipotent 
computer. Various adventures 
are recorded, and finally Chester, 
a far better man when he started 
out, rescues two time-stranded 
companions — one of them a 
synthetic naked girl who turns 
real just in time — and the book 
ends. 

Actually, Laumer has been 
playing a little joke on Simon 86 
Schuster. Buried in the middle 
of this volume is a long episode 
of straight adventure-with-lec- 
tures in which Chester is not only 
transformed from Jack Oakie to 
Jack Armstrong but encounters 
just the right people to lecture 
and be lectured at. Most of them 
are from the cast of Atlas 
Shrugged. But the attractiveness 
of the doctrines reflected lies be- 
tween Laumer and anyone with 
$3.95 to spend on a book. What I 
found interesting is that Laumer 
can do a number of things well; 
be funny, be straightforward, be 



suspenseful, be technical (about 
gliders and other simple machin- 
ery, not about time machines, 
though I grant you he designed 
it), be convincing even when he 
carps. My objection is that he 
has now done all of them, has 
expended - three or four widely 
different divergent plots and sit- 
uations besides, and doesn’t have 
even one whole book to show for 
it. 

f \ne of the two things most 
people remember about John 
Taine is that he was a writer of 
rococco adventure ( Before The 
Dawn, The Greatest Adventure ) 
as distinguished from, say, H. G. 
Wells the writer of sociological — 
and thus modern — science fiction. 
He is usually also known to have 
been Eric Temple Bell, once pro- 
fessor of mathematics somewhere. 
Even his publishers these days 
(in this case, Dover, which also 
publishes Wells as well as David 
Harum ) tend to present his 
books as nostalgia — pleasantly 
archaic “entertainments” spun by 
the idling brain of a narrowly 
specialized post- Victorian acade- 
mician and illustrated by Frank 
R. Paul. 

This is as serious an error, be- 
cause equally devious, as would 
be the notion that Isaac Asimov 
is a biochemist and science re- 
porter whereas Ray Bradbury is 
a writer. There are some very

hard human questions raised by 
such Taine novels as The Time 
Stream. (I also suggest that 
Seeds of Life is the more search- 
ing of two roughly similar novels 
of identity, the other being The 
Invisible Man.) 

Taine has a habit of telling 
things out of chronological order 
and starting slowly in any case. 
But he repays the slight neces- 
sary effort. Try the present 
Dover omnibus ( Three Science 
Fiction Novels by John Taine, 
Dover Publications, $2.00, large- 
size paperback) containing The 
Time Stream, The Greatest Ad- 
venture, and The Purple Sap- 
phire. My point is not that Taine 
will now impress you most as a 
social philosopher neglected in 
the shade of his distinguished 
English contemporary; my point 
is that these supposed entertain- 
ments of an outmoded scientifi- 
ction will impress you with how 
cogent they are, while entertain- 
ing you. 

T he Reefs of Space, by Fred- 
erik Pohl and Jack Wil- 
liamson (Ballantine Books), is 
the first Pohl-Williamson collab- 
oration for the adult science fic- 
tion market. It is not like a Jack 
Williamson novel, not like a 
Frederik Pohl novel, and not like 
a Pohl-Kornbluth novel; accord- 
ingly, it has passed the first test 
of this collaboration, and prob- 



ably answered your first question. 

It is full of inventions. Among 
them is the premise that the con- 
tinuous creation of hydrogen in 
empty space is paralleled by the 
continuous creation of life; that 
this life takes the form of mat- 
ter-converting organisms roughly 
analogous to coral, who have 
built up great “reefs” of crystal- 
lized heavy elements in space 
which may, in fact, be the mech- 
anism by which planets, and 
planetary life, came into being. 
These developments of elabor- 
ated ideas on the original Hoyle 
hypothesis are very impressive to 
watch ; when translated into men- 
tal pictures of great self-lumines- 
cent fairylands flashing and sail- 
ing in the wilderness of interstel- 
lar night, they become beautiful. 

The action plot is reminiscent 
of most novels done according to 
what I think of as collaborative 
method; the hero is at odds with 
his social organization (in this 
cace a machine - administered 
Plan of Man) against his own 
best wishes. He wants little more 
than to be accepted by the Plan 
as a willing, useful citizen (in this 
case, a physicist) but he unwit- 
tingly has done something and 
knows something to which the 
Plan objects, though he cannot 
get it to specify what that might 
be. In time, after a series of con- 
flicts, confrontations, escapes and 
perils, he learns the answers and 



158 



GALAXY 



participates in activities which 
drastically alter society so that 
he Can fit into it. 

But there are things going on 
here which quite rare in science 
fiction nowadays and completely 
overshadow the plot in any ap- 
praisal of this book’s individual- 
ity. Its most significant feature is 
the constant generation of 
science-fiction ideas and science- 
fiction characters, for which the 
hero’s troubles are never much 
more than a vehicle. 

The reefs are inhabited not 
only by the fusorians, who built 
them by fusing hydrogen into 
heavier elements, but by beauti- 
ful, reasonably intelligent golden 
spacelings, much like mute por- 
poises. Their natural enemies are 
the vicious pyropods, organically 
rocket- driven animals something 
like squid. And the reefs, of 
which the nearest is far beyond 
Pluto, have become the refuge of 
various dissidents from the Plan. 
Moreover, the spacelings have an 
inertialess (the book’s word is 
“jetless”) organic drive, which as 
everyone knows is impossible un- 
der the Third Law of Motion, 
and unlikely even in porpoises, 
but which nevertheless enables 
the spacelings to swim anywhere 
they please, taking their own at- 
mosphere with them. 

You can see the plot-threads 
in there, and sure enough the 
hero, who has been assigned the 



task of developing a jetless drive 
for the Plan, and accused of 
knowing all about it but refusing 
to cough it up, ends his tale on 
a reef, where all is made right in 
the end, which comes suddenly 
and flatly. 

What I did not see in there 
was that the writers would come 
up with a perfectly reasonable- 
sounding basis not only for the 
spacelings’ inertialessness but for 
Hoyle’s continuous-creation hyp- 
othesis, which as we all know is 
against common sense, a harder 
taskmaster than Newton ever 
was. 

The plot, as I say, ends anti- 
climatically. Furthermore, sev- 
eral characters are thrown away 
after considerable development, 
among them a chap named Opor- 
to and a Godot-figure named 
Ron Donderevo. There are other 
deficiencies of detail. But there 
are no deficiencies in the things 
that distinguish a science-fiction 
story from all other stories; there 
is the melding of actual science 
with an author’s scientific coun- 
ter-hypothesis that amplifies and 
romanticizes it, and there is the 
reader’s growing sense of grasp- 
ing something grand . the 
sense of wonder, if you will. This 
is not the best example of a novel 
you will see in the field this year, 
but it’s a most rewarding piece of 
science fiction.

PLANET 

OF 

FORGETTING 

BY JAMES H. SCHMITZ 

ILLUSTRATED BY GAUGHAN 



On fhit world men could not live,

I 

\ t best, Major Wade Colgrave 
decided, giving his mud- 
caked boot tips a brooding scowl, 
amnesia would be an annoying 
experience. But to find oneself, as 
he had just done, sitting on the 
rocky hillside of an unfamiliar 



world which showed no sign of 
human habitation, with one’* 
think-tank seemingly in good 
general working order but with 
no idea of how one had got there, 
was more than annoying. It could 
be fatal. 

The immediate situation didn’t 
look too dangerous. He might 

160 



have picked up some appalling 
local disease which would pres- 
ently manifest itself, but it wasn’t 
likely. A foreign-duty agent of 
Earth’s military intelligence was 
immunized early in his career 
against almost every possible 
form of infection. 

Otherwise, there was a variety 
of strange lifeforms in sight, each 
going about its business. Some 
looked big enough to make a 
meal of a human being and 
might, if they noticed him. But 
the gun on Colgrave’s hip should 
be adequate to knock such ideas 
out of predators who came too 
close. 

He’d checked the gun over au- 
tomatically on discovering a few 
minutes before that he had one. 
It was a standard military type, 
manufactured by upward of a 
dozen Terran colonies and ex- 
colonies. There were no markings 
to indicate its origin; but more 
important at the moment was 
the fact that the ammocounter 
indicated that it contained a full 
charge. 

What could have happened to 
get him into this position? 

The amnesia, however he’d ac- 
quired it, took a peculiar form. 
He had no questions about his 
identity. He knew who he was. 
Further, up to a point ... in 
fact, practically up to a specific 
second of his life . his memory 
seemed normal. He’d been on 



Earth, had been told to report at 
once to the office of Jerry Red- 
man, his immediate superior. And 
he was walking along a hall on 
the eighteenth floor of the head- 
quarters building, not more than 
thirty feet from the door of Red- 
man’s office, when his memory 
simply stopped. He couldn’t re- 
call a thing between that moment 
and the one when he’d found 
himself sitting there. 

Presumably Redman had pre- 
pared a new assignment for him: 
and presumably he’d been brief- 
ed on it and set off. If he could 
extend his memory even thirty 
minutes beyond the instant of 
approaching the door, he might 
have a whole fistful of clues to 
what had gone on during the in- 
terval. But not a thing would 
come to mind. It wasn’t a matter 
of many years being wiped out; 
if he’d aged at all, he couldn’t 
detect it. Some months, however, 
might easily have vanished, or 
even as much as two or three 
years . 

Had somebody given him a 
partially effective memory wipe- 
out and left him marooned here? 
Not at all likely. A rather large 
number of people unquestionably 
would be glad to see Intelligence 
deprived of his talents, but they 
wouldn’t resort to such round- 
about methods. A bullet through 
his head, and the job would have 
been done. 



PLANET OF FORGETTING

'i 'he thought that he’d been on 
-*■ a spaceship which cracked 
up in attempting a landing on 
this planet, knocking him out in 
the process, seemed more prob- 
able. He might have been the 
only survivor and staggered away 
from the wreck, his wits some- 
what scrambled. If that was it, 
it had happened very recently. 

He was thirsty, hungry, dirty, 
and needed a shave. But neither 
he nor his clothing suggested he 
had been an addled castaway on 
a wild planet for any significant 
length of time. The clothes were 
stained with mud and vegetable 
matter but in good general con- 
dition. He might have stumbled 
into a mud hole in the swamps 
which began at the foot of the 
hills below him and stretched 
away to the right, then climbed 
up here and sat down until he 
dried off. There was, in fact, a 
blurred impression that he’d 
been sitting in this spot an hour 
or so, blinking foggily at the 
landscape, before he suddenly 
grew aware of himself and his 
surroundings. 

Colgrave’s gaze shifted slowly 
about the panorama before him, 
searching for the glitter of a 
downed ship or any signs of hu- 
man activity. There was no im- 
mediate point in moving until 
he could decide in which direc- 
tion he should go. It was a 
remarkable view of a rather un- 



remarkable world. The yellow 
sun disk had somewhat more 
than Sol’s diameter. Glancing at 
it, he had a feeling it had been 
higher above the horizon when 
he noticed it first, which would 
make it afternoon in this area. It 
was warm but not disagreeably 
so; and now that he thought of 
it, his body was making no com- 
plaints about atmospheric condi- 
tions and gravity. 

He saw nothing that was of 
direct interest to him. Ahead and 
to the left, a parched plain ex- 
tended from the base of the hills 
to the horizon. In the low marsh- 
land on the right, pools of dark, 
stagnant water showed occasion- 
ally through thick vegetation. 
Higher up, lichen-gray trees 
formed a dense forest sweeping 
along the crests of the hills to 
within a quarter-mile of where 
Colgrave sat. The rock-cluttered 
hillside about him bore only 
patches of bushy growth. 

The fairly abundant animal 
life in view was of assorted sizes 
and shapes and, to Colgrave’s 
eyes, rather ungainly in appear- 
ance. Down at the edge of the 
marshes, herds of several spe- 
cies mingled peacefully, devot- 
ing themselves to chomping up 
the vegetation. An odd, green, 
bulky creature, something like a 
walking vegetable and about the 
height of a man, moved about 
slowly on stubby hind legs. It 



162 



GALAXY 



was using paired upper limbs to 
stuff leaves and whole plants 
into its lump of a head Most of 
the other animals were quadru- 
peds Only one of the carnivor- 
ous types was active ... a dog- 
sized beast with a narrow rod for 
a body and a long, weaving neck 
tipped by a round cat head. A 
pack of them quartered the tall 
grass between marsh and plain 
in a purposeful manner, evident- 
ly intent on small game. 

*T' , he other predators Colgrave 
* could see might be waiting 
for nightfall before they did 
something about dinner. Half a 
dozen heavy leonine brutes lay 
about companionably on the 
open plain, evidently taking a 
sunbath. Something much larger 
and dark squatted in the shade 
of a tree on the far side of the 
marsh, watching the browsing 
herds but making no move to 
approach them. 

The only lifeforms above the 
size of a lizard on the slopes 
near Colgrave were a smallish 
gray hopper, which moved with 
nervous jerkiness from one clump 
of shrubs to another. They seem- 
ed to be young specimens of the 
green biped in the marsh. There 
was a fair number of those 
downhill on the slopes, ranging 
between one and three feet in 
height. They were more active 
than their elders; now and then 



about two or three would go 
gamboling clumsily around a 
bush together, like fat puppies 
at play. After returning to the 
business of stripping clumps of 
leaves from the shrubbery they 
would stuff them into the mouth- 
slits of their otherwise feature- 
less heads. One of them, eating 
steadily away, was about twenty 
feet below him. It showed no 
interest whatever in the visitor 
from Earth. 

However he considered the 
matter, he couldn’t have been 
stumbling around by himself on 
this world for more than fifteen 
hours. And he could imagine no 
circumstances under which he 
might have been abandoned here 
deliberately. Therefore there 
should be, within a fifteen-hour 
hike at the outside, something — 
ship, camp, Intelligence post, 
settlement — from which he had 
started out. 

If it was a ship, it might be 
a broken wreck. But even a 
wreck would provide shelter, 
food, perhaps a means of send- 
ing an SOS call into space. 
There might be somebody else 
still alive on it. If there wasn’t, 
studying the ship itself should 
give him many indications of 
what had occurred, and why he 
was here. 

Whatever he would find, he 
had to get back to his starting 
point — 



164 



GALAXY 



Colgrave stiffened. Then he 
swore, relaxed slightly, sat still. 
There was a look of intense con- 
centration on his face. 

Quietly, unnoticed, while his 
attention was fixed on the im- 
mediate problem, a part of his 
lost memories had returned. 
They picked up at the instant 
he was walking along the hall 
toward Redman’s office, ran on 
for a number of months, ended 
again in the same complete, un- 
compromising manner as before. 

He still didn’t know why he 
was on this world. But he felt 
he was close to the answer now 
— perhaps very close indeed. 

II 

r ie Lorn Worlds, Imperial 
Rala — the Sigma File — 
Imperial Rala, the trouble 
maker, two centuries ago the 
most remote of the scattered 
early Earth colonies, now a com- 
pact heavy-industry civilization 
which had indicated for some 
time that it intended to sup- 
plant Earth as the leading inter- 
stellar power. It had absorbed 
a number of other ex-colonies of 
minor status, turned its attention 
then on the nearby Lorn Worlds 
as its first important target of 
conquest. Colgrave had been as- 
signed to the Lorn Worlds some 
years previously. At that time 
the Lornese were attempting to 



placate Rala and refused all as- 
sistance to Earth’s intelligence 
agencies. 

Redman had called him to the 
office that day to inform him 
there had been a basic shift in 
Lornese policies. He was being 
sent back. A full-scale invasion 
by Imperial Rala was in the 
making, and the Lorn Worlds 
had asked for support. Earth’s 
military forces could not be re- 
deployed in sufficient strength to 
meet a massive thrust in that 
distant area of space in time to 
check the expected invasion. 
When it came, the Lorn Worlds 
would fight a delaying action, 
giving ground as slowly as pos- 
sible until help arrived. Until it 
did arrive, they would remain 
sealed off from Earth almost 
completely by superior Ralan 
strength. 

Colgrave worked with Lornese 
intelligence men for almost 
three months, setting up the 
Sigma File. It contained in code 
every scrap of previously with- 
held information they could give 
against Rala. For decades the 
Lornese had been concerned al- 
most exclusively with the acti- 
vities of their menacing neighbor 
and with their own defensive 
plans. The file would be of im- 
mense importance in determining 
Earth’s immediate strategy. For 
Rala, its possession would be of 
equal importance. 



PLANET OF FORGETTING 



165 



Colgrave set off with it finally 
in a Lornese naval courier to 
make the return run to Earth. 
The courier was a very fast small 
ship which could rely on its 
speed alone to avoid intercep- 
tion. As an additional precaution, 
it would follow a route designed 
to keep it well beyond the es- 
tablished range of Ralan patrols. 

A week later, something hap- 
pened to it. Just what, Colgrave 
didn’t yet know. 

Besides himself there had been 
three men on board; the two 
pilot-navigators and an engineer- 
ing officer. They were picked 
men and Colgrave had no doubt 
of their competence. He didn’t 
know whether they had been 
told the nature of his mission, 
the matter was not brought up. 
It should have been an un- 
eventful, speedy voyage home. 

When one of the Lornese pilots 
summoned Colgrave to the con- 
trol room to tell him the cour- 
ier was being tracked by another 
ship, the man showed no serious 
concern. Their pursuer could be 
identified on the screen; it was 
a Ralan raider of the Talada 
class, ten times the courier’s 
tonnage but still a rather small 
ship. More importantly, a Ta- 
lada could produce nothing like 
the courier’s speed. 

Nevertheless, Colgrave didn’t 
like the situation in the least. He 
had been assured that the odds 



against encountering Ralan ves- 
sels in this area of space were 
improbably high. By nature and 
training he distrusted coinci- 
dences. However, the matter was 
out of his hands. The pilots al- 
ready were preparing to shift to 
emergency speed and, plainly, 
there was nothing to be done at 
the moment. 

He settled down to watch the 
operation. One of the pilots was 
speaking to the engineering offi- 
cer over the intercom; the other 
handled the controls. 

It was this second man who 
suddenly gave a startled shout. 

In almost the same instant, the 
ship seemed to be wrenched vio- 
lently to the left. Colgrave was 
hurled out of his seat, realized 
there was nothing he could do 
to keep from smashing into the 
bulkhead on his right . 

\ t that precise point, his mem- 
ories shut off again. 

“Fleegle!” something was 
crying shrilly. “Fleegle! Fleegle! 
Fleegle!” 

Colgrave started, looked 
around. The small green biped 
nearest him downhill was utter- 
ing the cries. It had turned and 
was facing him frontside. Pre- 
sumably it had just become 
aware of him and was expressing 
alarm. It waved its stubby fore- 
limbs excitedly up and down. 
Farther down the slope several 



166 



GALAXY 



of its companions joined in with 
“Fleegle!” pipings of their own. 
Others stood watchfully still. 
They probably had eyes of a 
sort somewhere in the wrinkled 
balls of their heads; at any rate, 
they all seemed to be staring 
up at him. 

“Fleegle! Fleegle! Fleegle!” 

The whole hillside below sud- 
denly seemed alive with the 
shrilling voices and waving green 
forelimbs. Colgrave twisted half 
around, glanced up the slope be- 
hind him. 

He was sliding the gun out erf 
its holster as he came quietly to 
his feet, completing the turn. 
The thing that had been coming 
down toward him stopped in mid- 
stride, not much more than forty 
feet away. 

It was also a biped, of a very 
different kind, splotchy gray- 
black in color and of singularly 
unpleasant appearance. About 
eight feet tall, it had long, lean, 
talon-tipped limbs and a com- 
paratively small body like a 
bloated sack. The round, black 
head above the body looked al- 
most fleshless, sharp bone-white 
teeth as completely exposed as 
those of a skull. Two circular 
yellow eyes a few inches above 
the teeth stared steadily at Col- 
grave. 

He felt a shiver of distaste. 
The creature obviously was a 
carnivore and could have be- 



come dangerous to him if he 
hadn’t been alerted by the cla- 
mor of the fleegle pack. In spite 
of its scrawny, gangling look, it 
should weigh around two hund- 
red and fifty pounds, and the 
teeth and talons would make it 
a formidable attacker. Perhaps it 
had come skulking down from 
the forest to pick up one of the 
browsing fleegles and hadn’t no- 
ticed Colgrave until he arose. 
But he had its full attention now. 

TTe waited, unmoving, gun in 
hand, not too seriously con- 
cerned — a couple of blasts 
should be enough to rip that 
pulpy body to shreds — but hop- 
ing it would decide to leave him 
alone. The creature was a walk- 
ing nightmare, and tangling with 
unknown lifeforms always in- 
volved a certain amount of risk. 
He would prefer to have nothing 
to do with it. 

The fleegle racket had abated 
somewhat. But now the toothy 
biped took a long, gliding step 
forward and the din immediately 
set up again. Perhaps it didn’t 
like the noise, or else it was 
interested primarily in Colgrave; 
at any rate, it opened its mouth 
as if it were snarling annoyedly 
and drew off to the right, mov- 
ing horizontally along the slope 
with long, unhurried spider 
strides, round yellow eyes still 
fixed on Colgrave. The fleegle 



PLANET OF FORGETTING 



167 



cries tapered off again as the 
enemy withdrew. By the time it 
had reached a point around sixty 
feet away, the slopes were quiet. 

Now the biped started down- 
hill, threading its way deliberate- 
ly among the boulders like a 
long-legged, ungainly bird. But 
Colgrave knew by then it was 
after him; and those long legs 
might hurl it forward with start- 
ling speed when it decided to 
attack. He thumbed the safety 
off the gun. 

With the fleegles silent, he 
could hear the rasping sounds 
the thing made when it opened 
its mouth in what seemed to be 
its version of a snarl . working 
up its courage, Colgrave thought, 
to tackle the unfamiliar creature 
it had chanced upon. 

As it came level with him on 
the hillside, it was snarling al- 
most incessantly. It turned to 
face him then, lifted its clawed 
forelegs into a position oddly 
like that of a human boxer, hesi- 
tated an instant and came on 
swiftly. 

A shrill storm of fleegle pip- 
ings burst out along the slope 
behind Colgrave as he raised the 
gun. He’d let the thing cut the 
distance between them in half, 
he decided, then blow it apart . 

Almost with the thought, he 
saw the big biped stumble awk- 
wardly across a rock. It made a 
startled, bawling noise, its fore- 



limbs flinging out to help it catch 
its balance; then it went flat on 
its face with a thump. 

There was instant stillness on 
the hillside. The fleegles appar- 
ently were watching as intently 
as Colgrave was. The biped sat 
up slowly. It seemed dazed. It 
shook its ugly head and whimp- 
ered complainingly, glancing this 
way and that about the slope. 
Then the yellow eyes found Col- 
grave. 

Instantly, the biped leaped to 
its feet, and Colgrave hurriedly 
brought the gun up again. But 
the thing wasn’t resuming its 
charge. It wheeled, went plung- 
ing away up the slope, now and 
then uttering the bawling sound 
it had made as it stumbled. It 
appeared completely panicked. 

Qtaring after it, Colgrave 
^ scratched his chin reflective- 
ly with his free hand. After a 
moment, he resafetied the gun, 
shoved it back into the holster. 
He felt relieved but puzzled. 

The biped, plainly, was not a 
timid sort of brute. It must pos- 
sess a certain amount of innate 
ferocity to have felt impelled to 
attack a creature of whose fight- 
ing ability it knew nothing. Then 
why this sudden, almost ludi- 
crous flight? It might be con- 
vinced he had knocked it down 
in some manner as it came at 
him, but still — 



168 



GALAXY 



Colgrave shrugged. It was un- 
important, after all. The biped 
had almost reached the top of 
the slope by now, was angling to 
the left to reach the lichen-gray 
forest a few hundred yards away. 
Its pace hadn’t lessened notice- 
ably. He was rid of it. 

Then, as Colgrave’s gaze shift- 
ed along the boulder-studded 
top of the hill, something like a 
half-remembered fact seemed to 
nudge his mind. He stared, 
scowling abstractedly. Was there 
something familiar about that 
skyline? Something he should 
... he made a shocked sound. 

An instant later, he was climb- 
ing hurriedly, in something like 
a panic of his own, up the rocky 
slope. 

Beyond that crest, he remem- 
bered now, the ground dropped 
away into a shallow valley. And 
in that valley — how many hours 
ago? — he had landed the Ralan 
Talada’s lifeboat, with the Sigma 
File on board. Every minute he 
had spent wandering dazedly 
about the area since then had 
brought him closer to certain re- 
capture — 

III 

TTe had been slammed against 
-*■ the bulkhead on the Lornese 
courier with enough violence to 
stun him. When he awoke, he 
was a prisoner under guard on 



the Talada, lying on a bunk to 
which he was secured in a man- 
ner designed to make him as 
comfortable as possible. The cab- 
in’s furnishings indicated it be- 
longed to one of the ship’s of- 
ficers. 

It told Colgrave among other 
things that they knew who he 
was. Raiders of the Talada class 
had a liquid-filled compartment 
in their holds into which several 
hundred human beings could be 
packed at a time, layered like 
so many sardines, and kept alive 
and semiconscious until the ship 
returned to port. An ordinary 
prisoner would simply have been 
dumped into that vat. 

His suspicions were soon con- 
firmed. A swarthy gentleman, 
who addressed Colgrave by name 
and introduced himself as Colo- 
nel Ajoran, an intelligence agent 
of Imperial Rala, came into the 
cabin. He waved out the atten- 
dant guard, offered Colgrave a 
cigarette, outlined his situation 
briefly to him. 

Rala had obtained information 
of his mission on the Lorn 
Worlds and arranged to have the 
courier which would take him 
back to Earth with the Sigma 
File intercepted along any of the 
alternate routes it might take. 
The courier’s engineering officer 
was a Ralan agent who had jam- 
med the emergency drive to

additional measure, released a 
paralysis gas to keep Colgrave 
and the Lornese pilots helpless 
until the courier could be board- 
ed, Colgrave already had been 
knocked out by the jolt given 
the ship by the jammed drive, 
but the pilots had some seconds 
left in which to act. 

One of them had shot himself 
in preference to becoming a Ral- 
an prisoner. The other had shot 
the engineering officer, had been 
captured with Colgrave and was 
at present being tortured to 
death in retribution for his ill- 
considered slaying of a Ralan 
agent. 

Colonel Ajoran offered Col- 
grave another cigarette, made a 
few philosophical remarks about 
the fortunes of war, and came 
out with his proposition. 

He wanted Colgrave’s help in 
decoding and transcribing the 
Sigma File immediately. In re- 
turn he would see to it that 
when they reached Imperial 
Rala, Colgrave would be treated 
as a reasonable man who under- 
stood that the only course open 
to him was to serve Ralan in- 
terests as effectively as he pre- 
viously had served those of 
Earth. In that event, he would 
find, Ajoran assured him, that 
Rala was generous to those who 
served it well. 

Implying that their discussion 
would be continued after dinner, 



the colonel then excused him- 
self, called the guard back in 
and left the cabin. 

Touring the next hour Colgrave 
' put in some heavy think- 
ing. He had made one observa- 
tion which presently might be 
of use to him. At the moment, 
of course, he could do nothing 
but wait. Colonel Aj oran’s plan 
was a bold one but made sense. 
Evidently he held a position fair- 
ly high up in the echelons of 
Ralan intelligence. Knowing the 
contents of the Sigma File in 
detail, he immediately would be- 
come an important man to rival 
government groups to whom the 
information otherwise would not 
be readily available. He could 
improve his standing by many 
degrees at one stroke. 

At the end of the hour, din- 
ner was served to Colgrave in 
his cabin by a woman who was 
perhaps as beautiful, in an un- 
usual way, as any he had seen. 
She was very slender; her skin 
seemed almost as pure a white 
as her close-cropped hair, and 
her eyes were so light a blue 
that in any other type they 
would have appeared complete- 
ly colorless. She gave, neverthe- 
less, an immediate impression of 
vitality and contained energy. 
She told Colgrave her name was 
Hace, that she was Aj oran’s lady, 
and that she had been instructed 



170 



GALAXY 




to see to it that he was pro- 
vided with every reasonable com- 
fort while he considered Ajor- 
an’s proposal. 

She went on chatting agree- 
ably until Colgrave had finished 
his dinner in the bunk. The col- 
onel then joined them for coffee. 
The discussion remained a very 
indirect one, but Colgrave pre- 
sently had the impression that 
he was being offered an alliance 
by Ajoran. He was one of Earth’s 
top military agents, possessed 
unique information which the 
colonel could put to extremely 
good use on Rala. Colgrave 
would, in effect, remain on Ajor- 
an’s staff and receive every con- 
sideration due a valuable asso- 



ciate. He gathered that one of 
the immediate shipboard consi- 
derations being proffered for his 
cooperation was the colonel’s 
lady. 

When the pair left him, Ajor- 
an observing that the Talada’s 
sleep period had begun, the thing 
had been made clear enough. 
Neither of the two guards as- 
signed to Colgrave reappeared 
in the cabin — which he had 
learned was a section of A j oran's 
own shipboard suite — and the 
door remained closed. Presum- 
ably he was to be left undisturb- 
ed to his reflections for the next 
seven hours. 

Colgrave did not stay awake 
long. He had a professional’s 



PLANET OF FORGETTING 



171 



appreciation of the value of rest 
when under stress; and he al- 
ready had appraised his situa- 
tion here as thoroughly as was 
necessary. 

He had a minimum goal — the 
destruction of the Sigma File — 
and he had observed something 
which indicated the goal might 
be achieved if he waited for 
circumstances to favor him. Be- 
yond that, he had an ascending 
series of goals with an ascend- 
ing level of improbability. They 
also had been sufficiently consid- 
ered. There was nothing else he 
cared to think about at the mo- 
ment. He stretched out and fell 
asleep almost at once. 

"IXThen he awoke some time 
' ” lata 1 with the hairs prick- 
ling at the base of his skull, he 
believed for a moment he was 
dreaming of the thing he had 
not cared to think about. There 
was light on his right and the 
shreds of a voice . ghastly 
whispered exhalations from a 
throat which had lost the 
strength to scream. Colgrave 
turned his head to the right, 
knowing what he would see. 

Part of the wall to one side 
of the door showed now as a 
vision screen; the light anu the 
whispers came from there. Col- 
grave told himself he was seeing 
a recording, that the Lornese 
pilot captured with him had 



been dead for hours. Colonel 
Ajoran was a practical man who 
would have brought this part of 
the matter to an end without un- 
reasonable delay so that he could 
devote himself fully to his far 
more important dealings with 
Colgrave, and the details shown 
in the screen indicated the pilot 
could not be many minutes from 
death. 

The screen slowly went dark 
again and the whispers ended. 
Colgrave wiped sweat from his 
face and turned on his side. 
There was nothing at all he could 
have done for the pilot. He had 
simply been shown the other 
side of Ajoran’s proposition. 

A few minutes later, he was 
asleep again. 

When he awoke the next time, 
the cabin was lit. His two guards 
were there, one of them arrang- 
ing Colgrave’s breakfast on a 
wall table across from the bunk. 
The other simply stood with his 
back to tiie doc* - , a nerve gun in 
his hand, his eyes on Colgrave. 
Fresh clothes, which Colgrave 
recognized as his own, brought 
over from the courier, had been 
placed on a chair. The section 
of wall which ordinarily covered 
the small adjoining bathroom was 
withdrawn. 

The first guard completed his 
arrangements and addressed Col- 
grave with an air of surly de- 
ference. Colonel Ajoran extended 



172 



GALAXY 



his compliments, was waiting in 
the other section of the suite and 
would like to see Major Col- 
grave there after he had dressed 
and eaten. Having delivered the 
message, the guard came over 
to unfasten Colgrave from the 
bunk, his companion shifting to 
a position from which he could 
watch the prisoner during the 
process. That done, the two with- 
drew from the room, Colgrave’s 
eyes following them reflectively. 

He showered, shaved, dressed, 
and had an unhurried breakfast. 
He could assume that Ajoran felt 
the time for indirect promises 
and threats was over, and that 
they would get down immediate- 
ly now to the business on hand. 

XltThen Colgrave came out of 
* ' the cabin, some thirty min- 
utes after being released, he 
found his assumption confirmed. 
This section of the suite was 
considerably larger than the sleep 
cabin; the colonel and Hace 
were seated at the far right 
across the room, and a guard 
stood before a closed door, a little 
left of the section’s center line. 
The door presumably opened on 
one of the Talada's passages. 
The guard was again holding a 
nerve gun, and a second gun of 
the same kind lay on a small 
table beside Ajoran. Hace sat at 
a recording apparatus just be- 
yond the colonel Evidently she 



doubled as his secretary when 
the occasion arose. 

At the center of the room, on 
a table large enough to serve as 
a work desk, was writing mat- 
erial, a tape reader and, near 
the left side of the table, the 
unopened Sigma File. 

Colgrave absorbed the impli- 
cations of the situation as he 
came into the room. The three 
of them there were on edge, and 
the nerve guns showed his pre- 
sent status — they wouldn’t in- 
jure him but could knot him up 
painfully in an instant and leave 
him helpless for minutes. He 
was being told his actions would 
have to demonstrate that he de- 
served Aj oran’s confidence. 

Almost simultaneously, the 
realization came to him that the 
favorable circumstances for 
which he had decided to wait 
were at hand. 

He went up to the table, look- 
ed curiously down, at the Sigma 
File. It was about the size and 
shape of a briefcase set upright. 
Colgrave glancing over at Ajor- 
an, said, “I’m taking it for grant- 
ed you’ve had the destruct 
charge removed.” 

Ajoran produced a thin smile. 

“Since it could have no useful 
purpose now,” he said, “I did, 
of course, have it removed.” 

Colgrave gave him an ironic 
bow. His left hand, brushing 
back, struck the Sigma File, sent 



PLANET OF FORGETTING 



173 



it toppling toward the edge of 
the table. 

He might as well have stuck 
a knife point into all three of 
them. A drop to the floor could 
not damage the file, but they 
were too keyed up to check their 
reactions. Ajoran started to his 
feet with a sharp exclamation; 
even Hace came half out of her 
chair. The guard moved mo:e 
effectively. He leaped forward 
from the wall, bending down, 
still holding the nerve gun, 
caught the file with his wrist 
and free hand as it went off the 
table, turned to place it back on 
the table. 

C olgrave stepped behind him. 

In the back of the jackets 
of both guards he had seen a 
lumpy bulge near the hip, indi- 
cating each carried a second gun, 
which could be assumed to be a 
standard energy type. His left 
hand caught the man by the 
shoulder, his right found the 
holstered gun under the jacket, 
twisted it upward and fired as 
he bent the guard over it. His 
left arm tingled — Ajoran had 
cut loose with the nerve gun, 
trying to reach him through the 
guard’s body. Then Colgrave had 
the gun clear, saw Ajoran com- 
ing around on his right and snap- 
ped off two hissing shots, letting 
the guard slide to the floor. Ajor- 
an stopped short, hauled open 



the sleep cabin door and was 
through it in an instant, slam 
ming it shut behind him. 

Across the room, Hace, almost 
at the other door, stopped, too, 
as Colgrave turned toward her. 
They looked at each other a 
moment, then Colgrave stepped 
around the guard and walked up 
to her, gun pointed. When he 
was three steps away, Hace 
closed her eyes and stood wait- 
ing, arms limp at her sides. His 
left fist smashed against the side 
of her jaw and she dropped like 
a rag doll. 

Colgrave looked back. The 
guard was twisting contortedly 
about on the floor. His face 
showed he was dead, but it would 
be a minute or two before the 
nerve charge worked itself out 
of his body. The colonel’s lady 
wouldn’t stir for a while. Ajoran 
himself . Colgrave stared 
thoughtfully at the door of the 
sleep cabin. 

Ajoran might be alerting the 
ship from in there at the mo- 
ment, although there hadn’t been 
any communication device in 
view. Or he could have picked 
up some weapon he fancied 
more than a nerve gun and was 
ready to come out again. The 
chances were good, however, that 
he’d stay locked in where he 
was until somebody came to in- 
form him the berserk prisoner 
had been dealt with. It wasn’t 



174 



GALAXY 



considered good form in Rala’s 
upper echelons to take personal 
risks which could be delegated 
to subordinates. 

Whatever happened, Colgrave 
told himself he could achieve 
his minimum goal any time he 
liked now. A single energy bolt 
through the Sigma File would 
ignite it explosively. And its 
destruction, getting it out of Ral- 
an hands, had been as much as 
he reasonably could expect to 
accomplish in the situation. 

He glanced at the closed door 
to the sleep cabin again, at the 
door which should open on one 
of the Talada’s passages, and 
decided he didn’t feel reasonable. 

He took the Sigma File from 
the table, carried it over to the 
passage door and set it down 
against the wall. He’d expected 
to see the second guard come 
bouncing in through the door as 
soon as the commotion began in 
here. The fact that he hadn’t 
indicated either that he’d been 
sent away or that A j oran’s suite 
was soundproofed. Probably the 
latter . 

Colgrave raised the gun, grasp- 
ed the door handle with his left 
hand, turned it suddenly, hauled 
the door open 

,r ~jphe second guard stood out- 
^ side, but he wasn’t given 
time to do much more than bulge 
his eyes at Colgrave. 



Colgrave went quickly along 
the passage, the Sigma File in 
his left hand, the gun ready 
again in his right. Now that it 
was over he felt a little shaky. 
By the rules he should, in such 
circumstances, have been satis- 
fied with his minimum goal and 
destroyed the file before he risk- 
ed another encounter with an 
armed man. If he’d been killed 
just now, it would have been 
there intact for Rala to decode. 

But the other goals looked at 
least possible now, and he 
couldn’t quite bring himself to 
put a bolt through the file be- 
fore it became clear that he’d 
done as much as he could. 

He moved more cautiously as 
he approached the corner of the 
passage. This was officer’s coun- 
try, and his plans were based 
on a remembered general im- 
pression of the manner in which 
the Talada raiders were con- 
structed. The passageway be- 
yond the corner was three times 
the width of this one ... it 
might be the main passage he 
was looking for. 

He glanced around the corner, 
drew back quickly. About thirty 
feet away in the other side of 
the passage was a wide door- 
space, and two men in officer’s 
uniform had been walking in 
through it at the moment he 
looked. Colgrave took a long, 
slow breath. His next goal sud- 



PLANET OF FORGETTING 



175 



denly seemed not at all far away. 

He waited a few seconds, look- 
ed again. Now the passage was 
clear. Instantly he was around 
the corner, running down to the 
doorspace. As he stepped out 
before it, he saw his guess had 
been good. He was looking down 
a short flight of steps into the 
Talada’s control room. 

Looking and firing . The gun 
in his hand hissed like an angry 
cat, but several seconds passed 
before any of the half-dozen 
men down there realized he 
was around. By then two of 
them were dead. They had hap- 
pened to be in the gun’s way. 
The drive control panels, the 
gun’s target, were shattering 
from end to end. Colgrave swung 
the gun toward a big communi- 
cator in a corner. At that mo- 
ment, somebody discovered him. 

The man did the sensible 
thing. His hand darted out 
throwing one of the switches be- 
fore him. 

A slab of battle- steel slid down 
across the doorspace, settling the 
control room away from the pas- 
sage. 

Colgrave sprinted on down the 
passage. The emergency siren 
came on. 

The Talada howled monstrous- 
ly like a wounded beast as it 
rolled and bucked. Suddenly he 
was in another passage, heard 
shouts ahead, turned back, stum- 



bled around a corner, went 
scrambling breathlessly up a 
steep, narrow stairway. 

At its top, he saw ahead of 
him, like a wish-dream scene, 
the lit lock, two white-faced 
crewmen staggering on the heav- 
ing deck as they tried to lift a 
heavy boxed item into it. 

Colgrave came roaring toward 
them, wild-eyed, waving the gun. 
They looked around at him, 
turned and ran as he leaped past 
them into the lock. 

The man at the controls of the 
Talada’s lifeboat died before he 
realized somebody was running 
up behind him. Colgrave drop- 
ped the Sigma File, hauled the 
body out of the seat, slid into 
it . 

ITe was several minutes’ flight 

^ away from the disabled raid- 
er before he realized he was 
laughing like a lunatic. 

He was clear. And now the 
odds, shifting all the way over, 
were decidedly in his favor. The 
question was how long it would 
take them to repair the damage 
and come after him. With 
enough of a start, they couldn’t 
know which way he’d headed 
and the chance of being picked 
up before he got within range 
of the Earth patrols became neg- 
ligible. But first there was the 
matter of getting the lifeboat 
fueled for the long run. It used 



176 



GALAXY 



iron, the standard medium; and 
he had, Colgrave calculated, 
enough for fifteen hours’ flight 
on hand. 

Which wasn’t too bad. It 
would have been nicer if he 
could have given the two crew- 
men time to dump another few 
boxes of ingots on board before 
he took off. But a scan of the 
stellar' neighborhood showed two 
planets respectively seven and 
eight hours away indicating con- 
ditions which should allow a 
man to stay a short time with- 
out serious damage or discom- 
fort. The lifeboat had the stan- 
dard iron location and refining 
equipment on board. A few 
hours on either of those worlds; 
and he’d be ready. 

After dropping the body of 
the Ralan pilot into space, he 
decided the seven hour run gave 
him a slight advantage. Once the 
Talada got moving, it had speed 
enough to check over both 
worlds without losing a signifi- 
cant amount of time. They could 
figure out his fuel requirements 
as well as he. If they arrived 
before he was finished and gone, 
the raider’s scanning devices 
were almost certain to spot the 
lifeboat wherever he tried to hide 
it. 

The chances seemed very good 
that they simply wouldn’t get 
there soon enough. But the mini- 
mum goal remained a factor. Col- 



grave decided to cache the Sig- 
ma File in some easily identi- 
fiable spot as soon as he touch- 
ed ground, take the boat to an- 
other section of the planet to do 
his mining, come back for the 
file when he was prepared to 
leave. It would cut the risk of 
being surprised with it to almost 
nothing . 

IV 

T T ow many hours had passed 
since then? Clawing his way 
up through the boulders and 
shrubbery, slipping in loose soil, 
Colgrave glanced back for a mo- 
ment at the sun. It was notice- 
ably lower in the sky again, 
appeared to be dropping almost 
visibly toward the horizon. But 
that told him nothing He re- 
membered the landing now; it 
had been daylight and he had 
come down to hide the Sigma 
File . had hidden it, his mem- 
ory corrected him suddenly. 
And then, for the next six or ten 
or fourteen hours, he appeared 
to have simply waited around 
here, in some mental fog, for the 
Talada to come riding its fiery 
braking jets down from the sky. 

The raider might arrive at 
any moment. Unless . 

Colgrave blocked off the rest 
of that thought. The slope had 
begun to level off as he ap- 
proached the top; he covered the 



PLANET OF FORGETTING 



177 



last stretch in a rush, lungs 
sobbing for breath. He clamber- 
ed on hastily through a jagged 
crack in the back of the ridge. 
For an instant, he saw the shal- 
low dip of the valley beyond. 

He dropped flat immediately. 
They were already here. 

It was a shock but one he 
realized he had half expected. 
After a few seconds, he crept 
up to the shelter of a rock from 
where he could look into the 
valley without exposing himself. 

The Talada had set down 
about a hundred yards back of 
the lifeboat, perhaps no more 
than half an hour ago. The 
smaller vessel’s lock stood open; 
a man came climbing out of it, 
followed by two others. The last 
of the three closed the lock and 
they started back toward the 
raider, from which other men 
were emerging. Ajoran had or- 
dered the lifeboat searched first, 
to make sure the Sigma File 
wasn’t concealed on it. Without 
that delay they should have 
caught him while he was still 
climbing up the slope . the 
group coming out of the Talada 
now was a hunting party; most 
of them had quick-firing rifles 
slung across their backs. 

They lined up beside the ship 
while a wedge-shaped device was 
maneuvered out of the lock. It 
remained floating a little above 
the ground near the head of the 



line, about twenty feet long, per- 
haps a dozen feet across at its 
point of greatest width. Colgrave 
had seen such devices before. 

It was a man-tracker, a type 
used regularly in Ralan expe- 
ditions against settlements on 
other planets. Its power unit and 
instruments were packed into the 
narrow tip; most of its space was 
simply a container, enclosed and 
filled with the same kind of 
numbing liquid preservative as 
that in the prisoner vats in the 
Talada ships. It could be set 
either to hunt down specific in- 
dividuals or any and all human 
beings within its range, and to 
either kill them as they were 
overtaken or pick them up with 
its grapplers and deposit them 
unharmed in the container. They 
could use it to follow him now; 
the clothing he had left on the 
ship would give it all the in- 
dications it needed to recognize 
and follow his trail. 

"]\ /T ore men had come out be- 
’-“-hind the machine, including 
one in a spacesuit. Colonel Ajor- 
an apparently was assigning al- 
most the entire complement of 
the Talada to the search for 
Colgrave and the Sigma File. 

Colgrave decided he’d seen 
enough. If he had been observed 
on the hillside as the Talada 
was descending, they would have 
gone after him immediately. In- 



178 



GALAXY 



stead, they would now follow 
their man-tracker over the ridge 
and down to the swamp where 
the herds of native animals were 
feeding. It gave him a little time. 

He crawled backward a dozen 
feet into the narrow crevasse, 
rose and retraced his way 
through it to the other side of 
the ridge. Beyond the plain, the 
sun was almost touching the 
horizon. The gray forest into 
which the aggressive biped had 
retreated began a few hundred 
yards to his right. He’d have 
better shelter there than among 
the tumbled rocks of the ridge. 

He went loping toward it, 
keeping below the crest-line. His 
eyes shifted once toward the 
swamp. One great tree stood 
there, towering a good hundred 
feet above the vegetation about 
it. The Sigma File was wedged 
deep among the giant’s root, a 
few feet below the water. He’d 
seen the tree from the air, put 
the lifeboat down in the little 
valley, hurried down to the 
swamp on foot. Twenty minutes 
later, the file was buried and 
he’d started wading back out 
of the swamp. What had hap- 
pened between that moment and 
the one when he found himself 
sitting on the hillside he still 
didn’t know . 

He reached the forest, came 
back among the trees over the 
top of the ridge until he saw 




PLANET OF FORGETTING 



the valley again. During the few 
minutes that had passed, the 
ridge’s evening shadow had 
spread across half the lower 
ground. It had seemed possible 
that when they realized how 
close it was to nightfall here, the 
hunt for him would be put off 
till morning. But Ajoran evi- 
dently wanted no delay. The 
man in the spacesuit still stood 
near the open lock of the ship, 
but the search party was coming 
across the valley behind their 
tracking machine. They headed 
for a point of the open ridge 
about a quarter-mile away from 
Colgrave. They’d have lights to 
continue on through the night if 
necessary. 

The chase plan was simple but 
effective. If the man-tracker 
hadn’t flushed him into view be- 
fore morning, the Talada could 
take the lifeboat aboard, move 
after the search party and put 
down again. They could work on 
in relays throughout the follow- 
ing day, half of them resting at 
a time on the ship, until he was 
run down. 

r T' l he Sigma File was safest 
where he’d left it. The track- 
er’s scent perceptors were acute 
enough to follow his trail through 
the stagnant swamp, getting signs 
from the vegetation he’d brushed 
against or grasped in passing, 
even from lingering traces in the 



water itself. And it might vary 
well detect the file beneath the 
surface. But — ironically, con- 
sidering Ajoran’s purpose — the 
discovery would be meaningless 
to the machine except as another 
indication that the man it was 
pursuing had been there. It 
would simply move on after 
him. 

The worst thing he could at- 
tempt at the moment would be 
to get down to the swamp ahead 
of the searchers and destroy the 
file. He would almost certainly 
be sighted on the open slopes be- 
low the forest; and either the 
tracker or the man in the space- 
suit could be overhead instants 
later. 

Colgrave’s gaze shifted back 
to the spacesuited figure. He 
would have to watch out for that 
one. His immediate role presum- 
ably was to act as liaison man 
between the ship and the hunt- 
ers, supplementing the communi- 
cator reports Ajoran would be 
getting on the progress of the 
search. But he was armed with 
a rifle; and if Colgrave was seen, 
he could spatter the area around 
the fugitive with stun-gas pel- 
lets while remaining beyond 
range of a hand weapon. He had 
floated back up to the Talada’ s 
lock for a moment, was now 
heading out to the ridge, drifting 
about fifty feet above the ground. 

It wasn’t a graceful operation. 



180 



GALAXY 



Maneuvering a suit designed for 
weightless service in space near 
the surface of a planet never 
was. But the fellow was handling 
himself fairly well, Colgrave 
thought. He came up to the ridge 
as the troop began filing across 
it, hovered above the line a few 
seconds, then swung to the left 
and moved off in a series of 
slow, awkward bounces above 
the hillside. He seemed to be 
holding something up to his hel- 
met, and Colgrave guessed he 
was scanning the area with a 
pair of powerful glasses. After 
some minutes, he came back. 

Colgrave had crossed over to 
the other side of the ridge to 
follow the progress of the col- 
umn. It had swung to the right 
as it started down, was angling 
straight toward the swamp along 
the route he had taken with the 
file. He watched, chewing his 
lip. If the man-tracker happen- 
ed to cross his return trail on 
the way, he might beiin trouble 
almost immediately . 

The man in the spacesuit drift- 
ed after the search party, passed 
above them some two hundred 
feet in the air, then remained 
suspended and almost unmoving. 
Colgrave glanced over at the hor- 
izon. The sun was nearly out of 
sight; its thin golden rim shrank 
and disappeared as he looked at 
it. Night should follow quickly 
here, but as yet he couldn’t see 



any advantage the darkness 
would bring him. 

The man in the spacesuit was 
coming back to the ridge. He 
hovered above it a moment, 
settled uncertainly toward the 
flat top of a boulder, made a 
stumbling landing and righted 
himself. He turned toward the 
plain and the swamp, lifting the 
object that seemed to be a pair 
of glasses to the front of his 
helmet again. Evidently he’d 
had enough of the suit’s airborne 
eccentricities for a while. 

Colgrave’s throat worked. The 
man was less than two hundred 
yards away . 

T T is eyes shifted toward a tuft 
of shrubs twenty feet be- 
yond the edge of the forest 
growth. 

Some seconds later, he was 
there, studying the stretch of 
ground ahead. Other shrubs and 
rocks big enough to crouch be- 
hind . but they would give 
him no cover at all if for some 
reason the fellow decided to lift 
back into the air. The fading 
light wouldn’t help then. Those 
were space glasses he was using, 
part of the suit, designed to pro- 
vide clear vision even when only 
the gleam of distant stars was 
there for them to absorb. 

But perhaps, Colgrave told 
himself, Spacesuit would not de- 
cide to lift back into the air. In 



PLANET OF FORGETTING 



181 



any case, no other approach was 
possible. The far side of the 
ridge was controlled by the Tala- 
da’s night-scanners, and they 
would be in use by now. 

He moved, waited, gathered 
himself and moved again. Space- 
suit was directing most of his 
attention downhill, but now and 
then he turned for a look along 
the ridge in both directions. 
Perhaps, as the air darkened, the 
closeness of the forest was get- 
ting on his nerves. Native sounds 
were drifting up from the plain, 
guttural bellowing and long- 
drawn ululations. The meat eat- 
ers were coming awake. Present- 
ly there was a series of short, 
savage roars from the general 
direction of the swamp; and Col- 
grave guessed the search party 
had run into some big carnivore 
who had never heard about en- 
ergy rifles. When the roaring 
stopped with a monstrous scream, 
he was sure of it. 

He had reduced the distance 
between them by almost half 
when the spacesuit soared jerk- 
ily up from the boulder. Col- 
grave had a very bad moment. 
But it lifted no more than a 
dozen feet, then descended again 
at a slant which carried it be- 
hind the boulder. The man had 
merely changed his position. And 
the new position he had selected 
took them out of each other’s 
sight. 



Colgrave was instantly on his 
feet, running forwards. Here the 
surface was rutted with weather 
fissures. He slipped into one of 
them, drawing out his gun, mov- 
ed forward at a crouch. A mo- 
ment later, he had reached the 
near side of the boulder 
which Spacesuit had stood. 

Where was he now? Colgrave 
listened, heard a burst of thin, 
crackling noises. They stopped 
for some seconds, came briefly 
again, stopped again. The suit 
communicator . the man must 
have taken off the helmet, or the 
sound wouldn’t have been audi- 
ble. He couldn’t be far away. 

Colgrave went down on hands 
and knees, edged along the side 
of the boulder to the right. From 
here he could see down the hill- 
side. On the plain, the night was 
gathering; the boundaries be- 
tween the open land and the 
swamp had blurred. But the bob- 
bing string of tiny light beams 
down there, switching nervously 
this way and that, must already 
be moving through the marsh. 

The communicator noises came 
again, now from a point appar- 
ently no more than fifteen feet 
beyond the edge of the boulder 
ahead of Colgrave. It was as 
close as he could get. It was im- 
portant that the man in the 
space suit should die instantly, 
which meant a head shot. Col- 
grave rose up, stepped out quiet- 



182 



GALAXY 



ly around the boulder, gun point- 
ed. 

The man stood faced half 
away, the helmet tipped back on 
his shoulders. In the last instant, 
as Colgrave squeezed down on 
the trigger, sighting along the 
barrel, the head turned and he 
saw with considerable surprise 
that it was Colonel Ajoran. 

Then the gun made its spite- 
ful hissing sound. 

Ajoran’s head jerked slightly 
to the side and his eyes closed. 
The spacesuit held him upright 
for the second or two before he 
toppled. Colgrave already was 
there, reaching under the collar 
for one of the communicator’s 
leads. He found it, gave it a 
sharp twist, felt it snap. 

V 

I n the Talada, the man watch 
ing the night-scanners saw 
Colonel Ajoran’s spacesuit ap- 
pear above the ridge and start 
back to the ship. He informed 
the control room and the lock 
attendant. 

The outer lock door opened as 
the suit came up to it. Colgrave 
made a skidding landing inside 
His performance in the suit had 
been no improvement on Ajor- 
an’s. He shut off the suit drive, 
clumped up to the inner door, 
left arm raised across the front 
of the helmet, hand fumbling 



with the oxygen hose. It would 
hide his face for a moment from 
whoever was on the other side 
of the door. His right hand rest- 
ed on his gun. 

The door opened. The atten- 
dant stood at rigid attention be- 
fore the control panel six feet 
away, rifle grounded, eyes front. 
Mentally blessing Ralan disci- 
pline, Colgrave stepped up be- 
side him, drew out the gun and 
gave the back of the man’s skull 
a solid thump with the barrel. 

When the attendant opened 
his eyes again a few minutes lat- 
er, his head ached and there was 
a gag in his mouth. His hands 
were tied behind him, and Col- 
grave was wearing his uniform. 

Colgrave hauled him to his 
feet, poked a gun muzzle against 
his back. 

“Lead the way to the control 
room,” he said. 

The attendant led the way. 
Colgrave followed, the uniform 
cap pulled down to conceal his 
face. Ajoran’s handgun and a 
stunner he had taken from the 
attendant were stuck into his 
belt. The attendant’s energy rifle 
and the one which had been 
strapped to the spacesuit were 
concealed in a closet near the 
lock. He had assembled quite an 
arsenal. 

When they reached the wide 
main passage in the upper level 
of the ship, he halted the lock 



PLANET OF FORGETTING 



183 



attendant. They retraced their 
steps to the last door they had 
pissed. Colgrave opened it. An 
office of some kind ... he 
motioned the attendant in and 
followed him, closing the door. 

He came out a few seconds 
later, shoved the stunner back 
under his belt, and stood listen- 
ing. The Talada seemed almost 
eerily silent. Not very surpris- 
ing, he thought. The number of 
men who had set out after him 
indicated that only those of the 
crew who were needed to coor- 
dinate the hunt and maintain 
the ship’s planetary security 
measures had remained on board. 
That could be ten or twelve at 
most; and every one of them 
would be stationed at his post 
at the moment. 

Colgrave went out into the 
main passage, walked quietly 
along it. Now he could hear an 
intermittent murmur of voices 
from the control room. One of 
them seemed to be that of a 
woman, but he wasn’t sure. They 
were being silent again before 
he came close enough to distin- 
guish what was being said. 

sphere was nothing to be gain- 
ed by hesitating at this point. 
The control room was the nerve 
center of the ship, but there 
couldn’t be more than four or 
five of them in it. Colgrave had 
a gun in either hand as he reach- 



ed the open doorspace. He turn- 
ed through it, started unhurriedly 
down the carpeted stairs leading 
into the control room, eye and 
mind photographing the details 
of the scene below. 

Ajoran’s lady was nearest, 
seated at a small table, her at- 
tention on the man before the 
communicator set in a corner al- 
cove on the left. This man’s 
back was turned. A gun was 
belted to his waist. Farther down 
in the control room sat another 
man, facing the passage but bent 
over some instrument on the 
desk before him. The desk 
shielded him almost completely, 
which made him the most dan- 
gerous of the three at the mo- 
ment. No one else was in view, 
but that didn’t necessarily mean 
that no one else was here. 

Hace became aware of him as 
he reached the foot of the stairs. 
Her head turned sharply: she 
seemed about to speak. Then her 
eyes were wide with shocked 
recognition. 

He’d have to get the man at 
the desk the instant she scream- 
ed. But she didn’t scream. In- 
stead, her right hand went up, 
two fingers lifted and spread. 
She nodded fiercely at the com- 
municator operator, next at the 
man behind the desk. 

Only two of them? Well, that 
probably was true. But he’d 
better use the stunner on Hace 



184 



GALAXY 



before attempting to deal with 
two armed men. 

At that moment, the commun- 
icator operator looked around. 

He was young and his reac- 
tions were as fast as Hace’s. He 
threw himself sideways out of 
the chair with a shout of warn- 
ing, hit the floor rolling over and 
clawing for his gun. The man 
behind the desk had no chance. 
As he jerked upright, startled, an 
energy bolt took him in the head. 
The operator had no real chance, 
either. Colgrave swung the gun 
to the left, saw for an instant 
eyes fixed on him, bright with 
hatred, and the other gun com- 
ing up, and fired again. 

He waited a number of sec- 
onds, then, alert for further 
motion. But the control room re- 
mained quiet. So Aj oran’s lady 
hadn't lied. She stayed where 
she was, unstirring, until he turn- 
ed toward her. Then she said 
quietly, her expression still in- 
credulous, “It seemed like magic! 
How could you get into the 
ship?” 

C olgrave looked at the dark, 
ugly bruise his fist had 
printed along the side of her 
jaw, said, “In Ajoran’s space- 
suit, of course.” 

She hesitated. “He’s dead?” 
“Quite dead,” Colgrave said 
thoughtfully. 

“I wanted,” Hace said, “to 



kill him myself. I would have 
done it finally, I believe . 
She hesitated again. “It doesn’t 
matter now. What can I do to 
help you? They’re in trouble 
down in the swamp.” 

“What kind of trouble?” 
“That isn’t clear. It began two 
or three minutes ago, but we 
haven’t been able to get an in- 
telligible report from the two 
communicator men. They were 
excited, shouted, almost irratio- 
nal.” 

Colgrave scowled. After a mo- 
ment, he shook his head. “Let’s 
clean up the ship first. How 
many on board?” 

“Nine besides those two . 
and myself.” 

“The man in the lock’s taken 
care of,” Colgrave said. “Eight. 
On the lifeboat?” 

“Nobody. Ajoran had a trap 
prepared for you there, in case 
you came back before they 
caught you. You could have got 
inside, but you couldn’t have 
started the engines, and you 
would have been unable to get 
out again.” 

Colgrave grunted. “Can you 
get the men in the ship to come 
individually to the control 
room?” 

“I see. Yes, I think I can do 
that.” 

“I’ll want to check you over 
for weapons first.” 

“Of course.” Hace smiled

slightly, stood up. “Why should 
you trust me?” 

“I wouldn’t know,” Colgrave 
said. 

They came in, unsuspecting, 
one by one; and, one by one, the 
stunner brought them down from 
behind. Shortly afterwards, a 
freight carrier floated into the 
Talada’s vat room. Hace stood 
aside as Colgrave unlocked the 
cover of the drop hole in the 
deck and hauled it back. A 
heavy stench surged up from the 
vat. Colgrave looked down a 
moment at the oily black liquid 
eight feet below, then dragged 
the nine unconscious men in turn 
over from the carrier, dropped 
them in, and resealed the vat. 

A ; man’s voice babbled and 
sobbed. Another man scream- 
ed in sudden fright; then there 
was a sound of rapid, panicky 
breathing mingled with the sobs 
Colgrave switched off the com- 
municator, looked over at Hace. 
“Is this what it was like before?” 
She moistened her lips. “No. 
this is insanity!” Her voice was 
unsteady. “They’re both com- 
pletely incapable of responding 
to us now. What could there be 
in that swamp at night to have 
terrified them to that extent? At 
least some of the others should 
have come back to the ship . .” 
She paused. “Colgrave, why do 
we stay here? You know what 



they’re like — why bother with 
them? You don’t need any of 
them to handle the ship. One 
person can take it to Earth if 
necessary.” 

“I know,” Colgrave said. He 
studied her, added, “I’m wonder- 
ing a little why you’re willing to 
help me get to Earth.” 

Anger showed for an instant 
in the pale, beautiful face. 

“I’m no Ralan! I was picked 
up in a raid on Beristeen when I 
was twelve. I’ve never wanted to 
do anything but get away from 
Rala since that day.” 

Colgrave grunted, rubbed his 
chin. “I see . Well, we can’t 
leave immediately. For one thing, 
I left the Sigma File in that 
swamp.” 

Hace stared at him. “You 
haven’t destroyed it?” 

“No. It never quite came to 
that point.” 

She laughed shortly. “Col- 
grave, you’re rather wonderful! 
Ajoran was convinced the file 
was lost, and that his only 
chance of saving his own skin 
was to get you back alive so he 
could find out what you had 
learned on the Lorn Worlds . 
No, you can’t leave the file be- 
hind, of course! I understand 
that. But why don’t we lift the 
ship out of atmosphere until it’s 
morning here?” She nodded at 
the communicator. “ That dis- 
turbance — whatever they’ve 



186 



GALAXY 




aroused down there — should 
have settled out by then. The 
swamp will be quiet again. Then 
you can work out a way to get 
the file back without too much 
danger.” 

Colgrave shook his head, got 
to his feet. “No, that shouldn’t 
be necessary. The man-tracker 
was being monitored from the 
ship, wasn’t it? Where is the 
control set kept?” 

Hace indicated the desk twen- 
ty feet behind her where the 
second man had sat when Col- 
grave came into the control 
room. 

“It’s lying over there. That’s 
what he was doing.” 

Colgrave said, “Let’s take a 



look at it. I want the thing to 
return to the ship.” He started 
toward the desk. 

Hace stood up, went over to 
the desk with him. “I’m afraid 
I can’t tell you how to operate 
it.” 

“I should be able to do it,” 
Colgrave said. “I played around 
a few hours once with a captured 
man-tracker which had been 
shipped back to Earth. This ap- 
pears to be a very similar mod- 
el.” He looked down at the mov- 
ing dark blurs in the screen 
which formed the center of the 
control set, twisted a knob to 
one side of it. “Let’s see what 
it’s doing now before I have it 
return to the ship.” 



PLANET OF FORGETTING 



187 



r I 'he screen cleared suddenly. 

The scene was still dark, but 
in the machine’s night-vision de- 
tails were distinct. A rippling 
weed bed was gliding slowly past 
below; a taller leafy thicket 
ahead moved closer. Then the 
thicket closed about the tracker. 

Hace said, “The operator was 
trying to discover through the 
tracker what was happening to 
the men down there, but it mov- 
ed out of the range of their 
lights almost as soon as the dis- 
turbance began. Apparently the 
devices, once set, can’t be turned 
around.” 

“Not unless you’re riding 
them,” Colgrave agreed. “Tele- 
monitoring starts them off and 
observes what they’re doing. 
They either go on and finish 
their business, or get their sen- 
sors switched off and return to 
their starting point. It’s still fol- 
lowing my trail. Now . 

“What’s that light?” Hace ask- 
ed uneasily. “It looks like the 
reflection of a fire.” 

The tracker had emerged from 
the thicket, swung to the left, 
and was gliding low over an ex- 
panse of open water, almost 
touching it. There were pale 
orange glitters on the surface 
ahead of it. 

Colgrave studied them, said, 
“At a guess it simply means 
there’s a moon in the sky.” He 
pushed a stud on the set, and 



the scene vanished. “That wiped 
out the last instructions it was 
given. It will come back to the 
ship in a minute or two.” 
Hace looked at him. “What do 
you have in mind?” 

“I’m riding it down to the 
swamp.” 

“Not now! In the morning 
you . 

“I don’t think I’ll be in any 
danger. Now let’s find a place 
where I’m sure you’ll stay locked 
up until I get back. As you said, 
one person can do all that’s 
needed to lift this ship off the 
planet and head away . 

VI 

F ive hundred feet above the 
ground, the man-tracker’s 
open saddle was not the most 
reassuring place to be in. But the 
machine was considerably easier 
to maneuver than the spacesuit 
had been and the direct route 
by air to the giant tree beneath 
which he’d concealed the Sigma 
File was the shortest and fastest. 
Colgrave was reasonably certain 
nothing had happened to the file, 
but he wouldn’t know until he 
held it in his hands again. 

The orange moon that had 
pushed above the horizon was 
a big one, the apparent diameter 
of its disk twice that of the van- 
ished sun. Colgrave was holding 
the tracker’s pace down. But no 



188 



GALAXY 



more than a few minutes passed 
before he could make out the 
big tree in the vague light, ahead 
and a little to his right. He 
guided the machine over to it, 
circled its crown slowly twice, 
looking down, then lowered the 
tracker down to a section of open 
water near the base of the tree, 
turned it and went gliding in 
toward the tangled root system 
of the giant. He turned the con- 
trol set off, remained in the sad- 
dle a few moments, looking about 
and listening. 

The swamp was full of sound, 
most of it of a minor nature . 
chirps, twittering, soft hoots. 
Something whistled piercingly 
three times in the tree overhead. 
Behind him, not too far off, was 
a slow, heavy splashing which 
gradually moved away. At the 
very limit of his hearing was 
something else. It might have 
been human voices, faint with 
distance, or simply his imagina- 
tion at work. 

Nearby, nothing moved. Col- 
grave pulled the control set out 
of its saddle frame, slid down 
from the saddle, clinging to it 
with one hand, finally dropped a 
few inches into a layer of mud 
above the mass of tree roots. He 
climbed farther up on the roots, 
found a dry place under one of 
them where he shoved the con- 
trol set in out of sight. Then he 
went climbing cautiously on 



around the great trunk, slipping 
now and then on the slimy root 
tangle beneath the mud . 

And here was where he had 
concealed the Sigma File. A little 
bay of water extended almost 
to the trunk itself about five 
feet deep. Colgrave slipped 
down into it. There was firm 
footing here. He moved forward 
to the tip of the bay, took a 
deep breath and crouched down. 
The warm water closed over his 
head. He groped about among 
the root shelves before him, 
touched the file, gripped it by its 
handle and drew it out. 

He clambered up out of the 
water, started back around the 
tree . 

And there the thing stood. 

/Colgrave stopped short. This 
^ ■* was almost an exact dupli- 
cation of what happened after 
he brought the Sigma File down 
here and concealed it. It had 
been daylight then, and what he 
saw now as a bulky manlike 
shape in the shadow of the tree 
had been clearly visible. It was 
a green monstrosity, heavy as a 
gorilla, with a huge, round bob- 
bing ball of a head which show- 
ed no features at all through its 
leafy appendages. It was bigger 
than it had looked at a distance 
from the hillside, standing al- 
most eight foot tall. 

The first time, it had been only 



PLANET OF FORGETTING 



189 



a few yards away, moving to- 
ward him around the tree, when 
he saw it. His instant reaction 
had been to haul out his gun . 

Now he stayed still, looking at 
it. His heart beat had speeded 
up noticeably. But this was, he 
told himself, an essentially 
vegetarian creature. And it was 
peaceable because it had a com- 
pletely effective means of de- 
fense. It could sense the impulse 
to attack in an approaching car- 
nivore, and it could make the 
carnivore forget its purpose. 

As often as was necessary. 

Colgrave made himself start 
forwards. He had no intention, 
his mind kept repeating, of 
harming this oversized fleegle, 
and it had no intention of harm- 
ing him. It did not move out of 
his path as he came toward it, 
but turned slowly to keep facing 
him as he clambered past over 
the roots a few feet away. 

Colgrave didn’t look back at 
it and heard no movement be- 
hind him. He saw the man- 
tracker floating motionless above 
the mud ahead, put the file 
down and pulled the tracker’s 
control set out from under the 
root where he had left it. A 
minute or two later, he was back 
in the machine’s saddle, out in 
the moonlight away from the big 
tree, the Sigma File fastened to 
his belt. 

He tapped a pattern of in- 



structions into the control set, 
checked them very carefully, 
slid the set into the saddle frame 
and switched it on. 

The man-tracker swung about 
purposefully, went gliding away 
through the swamp. A hundred 
yards on, it encountered three 
fleegles, somewhat smaller than 
the one under the tree, wading 
slowly leg-deep through the 
mud. They stopped as the ma- 
chine appeared, and Colgrave 
thought friendly and admiring 
things about fleegles until they 
were well behind him again. 
Perhaps a minute later, the 
man-tracker stopped in the air 
above the first of the Talada's 
loct crew. 

He had crawled into a thicket 
and was blubbe, ing noisily to 
himself. When two of the ma- 
chine’s grapplers flicked down 
into the thicket and locked 
about him, he bawled in horror. 
Colgrave looked straight ahead, 
not particularly wanting to 
watch this. There was a click be- 
hind him as the preservative 
tank opened. For a moment, his 
nostrils were full of the stink of 
the liquid. Then there was a 
splash, and the bawling stopped 
abruptly . The tank clicked shut. 

'■y'he man-tracker swung 
around on a new point, set 
off again. Its present instructions 
were to trail and collect every 



190 



GALAXY 



human being within the range of 
its sensory equipment, except its 
rider. 

They’d been on edge to begin 
with here, Colgrave told himself. 
Their rifles already had brought 
down one brute which came 
roaring monstrously at them in 
the dusk; and presumably the 
rifles could handle anything else 
they might encounter. But they 
hadn’t liked the look of the 
swamp the man-tracker was 
leading them into. Wading 
through pools, slipping in the 
mud, flashing their lights about 
at every menacing shadow, they 
followed the machine, mentally 
cursing the order that had sent 
them after the Earth intelligence 
agent as night was closing in. 

And then a great green ogre 
was standing in one of the light 
beams . 

Naturally, they tried to shoot 

it. 

And as they made the decis- 
ion, they began to forget. 

Progressive waves of amnesia 
. first, perhaps, only a touch. 
The men lifting rifles forgot they 
were lifting them. Until they saw 
the fleegle again — 

The past few hours might be 
wiped out next. They stood in a 
swamp at night, not knowing 
how they’d got there or why 
they were there. But they had 
rifles in their hands, and an 
ogrish shape was watching them 



Months forgotten now. The 
fleegle could keep it up. 

About that point, they’d be- 
gun to stampede, scattered, 
ploughed this way and that 
through the swamp. But the 
fleegles were everywhere. And as 
often as a gun was lifted in pan- 
ic, another chunk of memory 
would go. Until the last of the 
weapons was dropped. 

The man-tracker wasn’t round- 
ing up men but children in 
grown-up bodies, huddled in 
hiding on a wet, dark nightmare 
world, dazed and uncompre- 
hending, unable to do more than 
wail wildly as the machine pick- 
ed them up and placed them in 
its tank. 

VII 

/^ol grave came out of the com- 
partment where the man- 
tracker was housed, locked the 
door and turned off the control 
set. 

“You haven’t closed the vat 
yet,” Hace said. 

He nodded. “I know. Let’s go 
back.” 

“I’m still not clear on just 
what did happen,” she went on, 
walking beside him up the pas- 
sage. “You say they lost their 
memories . .?” 

“Yes. It’s a temporary thing. 
I had the same experience when 
I first got here, though I don’t

seem to have been hit as hard as 
most of them were. If they 
weren’t floating around in that 
slop now, they’d start remember- 
ing within hours.” 

He opened the door to the vat 
room, motioned her inside. Hace 
wrinkled her nose in automatic 
distaste at the odor of the pre- 
servative, said, “It’s very strange. 
How could any creature affect 
a human mind in that manner?” 
“I don’t know,” Colgrave said. 
“But it isn’t important now.” He 
followed her in, closing the door 
behind him, went on, “Now this 
will be rather unpleasant, so let’s 
get it over with.” 

She glanced back at him. “Get 
what over with, Colgrave?” 
“You’re getting the ride to 
Earth you said you wanted,” 
Colgrave told her, “but you’re 
riding along with the crew down 
there.” 

Hace whirled to face him, her 
eyes wild with fear. 

“Ah — no! Colgrave . I . 
you couldn’t . .” 

“I don’t want you awake on 
the ship,” he told her. “Though 
I might have thought of some 
other way of making sure you 
wouldn’t be a problem if my 
pilot hadn’t died as he did.” 
“What does that have to do 
with me?” Her voice was shrill. 
“Didn’t I try to help you in the 
control room?” 

“You played it smart in the 



control room,” Colgrave said. 
“But you would have gone into 
the vat with the first group if I 
hadn’t thought you might be use- 
ful in some way.” 

“But why? Am I to blame for 
what Ajoran did?” 

Colgrave shrugged. “I’m not 
sorry for what happened to 
Ajoran. But I’m not stupid 
enough to think that a Ralan in- 
telligence agent would go out in 
a spacesuit to help look for me, 
leaving the ship in charge of a 
couple of junior officers. Ajoran 
went out because he was order- 
ed to do it. And there were a few 
other things. What they add up 
to, lady, is that you were the 
senior agent in this operation. 
And it would suit you just fine 
to get back to Rala with the 
Sigma File, and no one left alive 
to tell how you almost let it get 
away from you.” 

Hace wet her lips, her eyes 
darting wildly about his face. 

“Colgrave, I . she started 
to plead. 

“No,” Colgrave said. He placed 
his hand flat against her chest, 
shoved hard. Hace went stum- 
bling backward toward the open 
drop hole of the vat. There was 
a scream and a splash. He walk- 
ed over and looked down. The 
oily surface was smooth again. 
He slammed the cover down over 
the drop hole, sealed it and left 
the room.

A bout two hours had passed. 

The Talada hung in space 
near the fringes of the solar sys- 
tem which contained the fleegle 
world. Colgrave had completed 
his studies of the ship’s naviga- 
tional system. It was a standard 
setup for long-range vessels, 
self-locating, self-focussing. 
Once he got the raider under 
way, there would be less for him 
to do than there would have 
been on the lifeboat. 

But there was one more mat- 
ter to take care of before he left. 
On the planet he hadn’t dared 
let himself think about it. 

The Talada ' s computers knew 
where the ship was but weren’t 
registering the fact. For most 
navigational purposes, it was 
meaningless. You only had to 
know where you wanted to go. 
Carrying out a location check 
was a separate operation which 
would take him at least another 
hour. 

The time wouldn’t be wasted, 
Colgrave thought. Recording the 
ship’s exact coordinates here 
might turn out to be as impor- 
tant as getting the Sigma File to 
Earth — more so . 

It had been at the other end 
of the swamp, shortly before he 
returned to the ship, while the 
tracker was picking up a man 
who had got farther than most, 
that he suddenly had become 
aware of a glow of greenish 



luminescence on his left and 
turned in the saddle to look at 
it. 

There was a wide opening in 
the forested hillside above the 
level of the swamp. Colgrave 
had stared at it with a feeling 
almost of superstitious fear. A 
group of fleegles was streaming 
slowly into it; a few others were 
emerging. There was a sense of 
something ordered and arranged 
stretching far back into the dim 
green light under the hill. The 
equivalant of human buildings, 
he had thought. And beyond 
them, taller than the structures, 
he could make out vague, green 
figures moving hugely about 
His skin was crawling when 
the tracker deposited its last 
captive in the tank, turned and 
went gliding back toward the 
center of the swamp. He had a 
strong conviction he should do 
nothing whatever to draw atten- 
tion to himself here. But as the 
machine came up to a dense 
thicket which would have shut 
off his view, Colgrave looked 
back. The opening in the hill had 
vanished. 

A n underground civilization of 
some kind, and intelligence 
. In all the time man had 
been in space, there had been no 
previous recorded contact with 
another intelligent race. 

Perhaps we’ve never taken the 



PLANET OF FORGETTING

time to really look for thorn, 
Colgrave thought. Our main 
business somehow always seems 
to be fighting among ourselves. 

As the coming war with Rala 
would prevent any immediate 
action being taken on the report 
he would make. But some day 
a scientific expedition would 
start out from Earth to settle 
down on the fleegle world and 
make contact — 

Colgrave leaned forward in his 
chair, pulled the Talada’s loca- 
tor toward him, snapped it in- 
to the computing system, and 
placed his hand on the activating 
switch. 

Then he went still, head 
raised, tilted sideways a little 
in an attitude of listening. 

From somewhere, very far 



away, a huge, quiet voice was 
addressing him. 

“FORGET IT,” it said. 

Colgrave gave the locator a 
puzzled look, pulled it out of 
the system, stood up and re- 
stored it to its casing. 

He returned, studied the focal 
chart which contained Earth 
briefly once more, then reached 
out and cut in the main drive. 
The Talada began to move. 

Colgrave settled back in his 
chair, watching a not very re- 
markable yellow sun slide slow- 
ly away from him in the screen. 
There was a momentary uneasy 
feeling that something else was 
also sliding away . something 
very important that now would 
be forever lost. Then he forgot it.

FORECAST 

Next issue Frank Herbert will be with us again with a novelette 
called Committee of the Whole. We're always glad to welcome the author 
of Dustworld, Under Pressure and any number of other well-remembered 
stories; we're pleased, too, to have in the same issue Kei*'> Laumer, Gordon 
R. Dickson, John Brunner, Willy Ley and Algis Budrys; but we have an idea 
that the real news of the issue will be two writers you've seldom seen before. 

Their names are Larry Niven and Hayden Howard, both young Cali- 
fornians, both previously published in our companion magazine. If — - where, 
as you may have noted, we have for some time been following a policy of 
introducing at least one brand-nsw-anywhere author in each issue. Niven 
is a graduate of this school; Howard's first appearance antedated it — but 
it is writers like these that we are looking for in doing this, and we're pleased 
to be able to say that we are finding them! 

We think these two, in particular, are Going Somewhere. We cer- 
tainly hope they'll be back with us in their travels — early, often and long!
